Our goal with the DOM implemetation:
* Read-only access of the document structure. 
* Initially, access at the generic NODE level. Later with dedicated interfaces.
* Partial W3C DOM4 specification.
* High-performance and low memory footprint. Especially low GC pressure.

* We will rename method names to have .Net friendly naming. It is NOT our goal 
  to have full compatibility at the interface level.
