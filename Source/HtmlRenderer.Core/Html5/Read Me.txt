Our goals with the HTML5 implementation:
* Full conformance with HTML 5.1 (except when noted)
* Conformance according to the "Non-interactive presentation user agents"
  requirements. See: http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/infrastructure.html#conformance-classes
* Parsing of full HTML documents and creation of corresponding DOM.
	- We will take a large number of random bur representative documents.
	- The parser must be able to pass those documents without crashing
	- The parser should output the same DOM as Google Chrome outputs.
		- Few minor unimportant differences should be accepted.
* OPTIONAL: It should report parsing warnings (we still don't know how to test this)
* FUTURE: We should be able to parse Document Fragments and support Templates.


Our goals are NOT:
* Implement the full HTML5 API and DOM API
* Implement scripting support
* Implement support for dynamic documents, for example no write() API
	- However, low level DOM manipulation API is available.
* Support for HTML or DOM validation. Using the API a developer can create an illegal document.
