PHS was always a power in basketball. The previous year, the Bulldogs with no starter over 6&#39;2&quot; went to the semifinals of the state tournament at the ‘Cowbarn’ as Coach Pannell called it. Barton Coliseum was the real name.</p><p name="ddbe" id="ddbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Little did everyone know that 1970 was going to be different. Both on the A team and the B team, as they were called in those days.

The Beezers were down by one.</p><p name="f046" id="f046" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Worse, they had not won a game all year. As was the norm this night, at the end of the 3rd quarter, the Bulldog Bs were down 17 to the Westside Warriors. Westside took several of their players to the dressing room so they could get ready for the A game. All seemed lost, yet again.</p><p name="a34b" id="a34b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Down 44–27, the Beezers went for broke and started pressing. Ricky Wineland stole a ball and made a layup. Terry Horton hit his patented left handed setter from around the top of the key. Doug Wigginton got in on the scoring. Chuck Dudley hit 3 shots for 6 points in the run.</p><p name="71c4" id="71c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Suddenly, the crowd that was arriving for the A game sensed something was brewing at the Bulldog gymnasium. The students, the cheerleaders began to have hope, something not achievable all year so far.</p><p name="3f51" id="3f51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fighting hard, the Beezers closed to within one.</p><p name="ed48" id="ed48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Coach Gore called time out, looked at us and called the play.</p><p name="22a2" id="22a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I (Chuck Dudley) was to get the ball and take the shot. This was entrusted to a guy who had never played organized ball until the start of the season. A chance for glory. Scared? Probably, it was a long time ago.</p><p name="c685" id="c685" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our 6&#39;8&quot; tuba player from the band, Jeff Hoffman was inserted into the game.</p><p name="53ce" id="53ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The referee handed the ball to our player, and it was worked to me.</p><p name="9dff" id="9dff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I found an opening, turned and shot off the backboard, using the square as I was taught……the ball looked good, hit the square…….bounded on the rim…………………</p><p name="d699" id="d699" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MEET THE BEEZERS</strong></p><p name="32ec" id="32ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you look at this team, there was not a lot of talent or experience. The best players from a pretty good 9th grade Bullpup team were placed on the A Team. As Richard Brummett, a senior that year would admit, there wasn’t a lot of basketball talent on the A team either. They lost some games where the local sportswriter claimed there were cobwebs over the Paragould basket.

Coach Gore asked him what was the problem and Spike said that Joe was throwing them so hard they curved like a baseball curve ball! Said this team was the most fun he ever had in school. At Trumann, Spike fouled out before halftime…..Joe shot the ball 15–20 times a game and only made 2 or 3…..wouldn’t pass the ball so Spike threatened him…..once after 3 minutes Gore called a timeout and asked him why he was sucking air so bad……..Spike said he was having a heart attack!! He now lives in Dumas, Texas, in the Panhandle. Self employed with service stations and contracting and painting companies.</p><p name="ee10" id="ee10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Terry Horton</strong>……remembers all the running and scoring 6 points in the Westside game……….one of the teams left handers……last year for Terry to play, went on to long career in wildlife management…….now Marketing Director for FTN Associates in Little Rock, a company concerned with maintaining water quality in Arkansas.

Running bleachers………when he didn’t get put on varsity he decided to hang it up. Doug has been in the car business ever since he graduated, and been quite successful working in St Louis. He still lives in Paragould.</p><p name="a5b5" id="a5b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Roger Easton</strong>…remembers he was tired of losing and it was embarrassing. Steve Maxwell was cutting up after we lost in the dressing room and he had to keep a towel over his head while Coach was chewing us out to keep from being seen laughing……..haven’t seen Roger in a while and just recently made contact. Seemed to remember we were legends in our own minds. He is in charge of the power plant operations at St Vincent’s hospital in Little Rock.

Joe remembers that against full court presses, he would throw the ball to Spike and he would drop the ball! Word for the team was ‘pitiful’……..Never played again after this year. His brother, Bones Farley, was very much into our games. He was a 9th grader and remembers the Beezers were must see games! Joe could drive so Bones tagged along. They remember Coach asking Spike who he was guarding and Spike said the guy in the black hair…….we were playing an all black school back in the day……..Joe became a doctor, and recently retired as an ER doctor in Springfield, Missouri.</p><p name="31b3" id="31b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rick Wineland</strong>………our man Otis…….Rick was fast, and was a key in the Westside game, stealing the ball several times……thought it was remarkable that at one time there were FOUR left handers on the court at the same time…Rick went on and lettered as a Senior on the A team……..and played at a tech school near Camden after graduation………running bleachers……along with Curtwright, wouldn’t quit…….Rick has owned his own business and worked with real estate in Paragould. He said we chose to deal with what we had, and it was fun in the end, just not at the time. Rick has been a great supporter of the PHS class of 1972.</p><p name="def3" id="def3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Richard Curtwright</strong>…….Richard came to Paragould our 9th grade year…played football……..he was real fast. He and Jeff Hoffman became real friends as Jeff ‘convinced’ a couple of guys trying to give Richard crap as the new guy to bug off. Interesting story because Jeff was such a gentle man. Richard said we did the best we could do…….he went to Oak Grove as a junior and graduated from there. He has been involved with Christian rock music for many years and still is today. Been great to see him again after all these years.</p><p name="41ad" id="41ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Franklin Diggs</strong>………….as mentioned, Frank played because Doc and Terry did.

Larry lives in Mt View.</p><p name="facd" id="facd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Chuck Dudley</strong>……….didn’t play until sophomore year. Decided to play after being manager for the Bullpups. Spent all my time shooting………the Westside game was a big memory…….we almost beat Tech, and that would have been something…….made good friends with these guys back then. Earned 2 varsity letters, was able to start our Senior year, and was a walkon at the University of Tennessee at Martin………spent 40 years in the financial services business and lived in Hot Springs since 1993.</p><p name="aa02" id="aa02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Coach Clinton Gore</strong>……….Coach is now 78…lives in Osceola after a long, successful coaching career….had 5 bypass surgery in the last couple of years. Paragould was his first job……..said he probably would do things a little different, but back then it was his way or the highway. He remembered the team tried hard………and putting Jeff into the game late. Little remembered…….he and Sammy Weir had a chance to go to the Big Shootout between Arkansas and Texas in December 1969………so David Meek coached us for two games………with no better results. I asked Clint what he would say to you guys after all these years, and he said: Tough times don’t define who you are, and that he is proud of all of you…….he was glad to hear from me (I’ve seen him over the years) and to hear about this team.</p><figure name="7c46" id="7c46" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 700px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 133.29999999999998%;"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image" data-image-id="1*mZXfEYHX5r62bCCGaY0VFA.jpeg" data-width="2448" data-height="3264" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*mZXfEYHX5r62bCCGaY0VFA.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*mZXfEYHX5r62bCCGaY0VFA.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mZXfEYHX5r62bCCGaY0VFA.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner"><img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*mZXfEYHX5r62bCCGaY0VFA.jpeg"></noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Chuck Dudley Shooting</figcaption></figure><p name="9833" id="9833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">WHAT OTHERS REMEMBER</strong></p><p name="e9d8" id="e9d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Greg Marlar had no idea of our record.

But then again the A team didn’t have a great year either…….and so it was…..</p><p name="e7bf" id="e7bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember so much for some reason………..one day Jeff said he was 7 for 11 on rebounds…..I said what do you mean by that Jeff? I tried for 11 and got to 7!! Only Jeff could say that………Remember Joe Farley had this circle move, he’d go round and round and then shoot it. Hully Gully would drive into the lane with no fear and throw up a shot.

Maybe Steve Block ran on the court…..it was pandemonium, like we had won the national championship. For me, I realized it was the first winning game I had ever played in.

As a team, we all had to go through this together, and so there is that bond from long ago. Win/lose……..it doesn’t matter now. We learned how to cope, we learned to lose and get back up and fight again. We ran a lot. We laughed a lot. We learned to be for each other. We learned to care about each other. Isn’t that what sports is supposed to teach?</p><p name="e2e4" id="e2e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We went on to have families, careers, good times, bad times.
