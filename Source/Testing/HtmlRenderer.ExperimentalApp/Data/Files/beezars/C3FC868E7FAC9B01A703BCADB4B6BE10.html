      or the yodelin' yankees? i can hear our battle cry now! right so back to those in a bit, but first! this will be my last time writing until after spring break (march 4-march 12), but hopefully that week we're back i'll come back to write all about it! so friday- tuesday i'll be in chicago to with amy and mc, and i can't wait! then i'm flying down to Austin, tx on tuesday night to hang out with my brother & his girlfriend Iskra for a few days until saturday. i'll be getting cowboy boots while we're there! i've wanted them for so long! perhaps i will also bring back the skills of le line dance. i think no though, so don't hold your breath. bumbling and tripping around in cowboy boots is as much texan humiliation as i can handle! for one year at least. ok so back to the past not future so much anymore. ok so i wrote on thursday... ah but before mulholland dr., and yes i can see that i spelled it incorrectly in last blog, but i know it now! and may i just say, where has this movie been all my life? i LOVED it. not really when i first saw it, but now it's all i can think about. i really need to see it again, right now, be back in a bit. just kiddin, i'm so tricky! ok more excitement- got a great ghetto cd from meg, so hot right now! made by two irish kids in jersey, can't get more ghetto than that. and i also got a fun letter, card, funny magnet and awesome new years pics from vicky, thanks so much! i love them, the magnet says "i drink to the general joy of the whole table" and it's from macbeth. vicky i don't know if you know, but i'm actually in a shakespeare class right now! freaky! thursday night... little OC (bad move with the spider man kiss, not even a little comical but yay for summer and seth getting back together!), out to the sig nu halls to pregame for a bit before hitting up the bars, which i didn't make it to, but hey maybe next time! just didn't have enough sleep the week before to be fun/not wasted after one drink. friday... classes as usual, errands, hair cut, fireside dinner/ceremony for the newbies (in a 2003 census my name was the 8th most popular of people living in the US. go ahead, try and figure out how THAT"s relavent). back to north for some coffee (and bailey's? sure!), then over to the boy's for a movie that turned into watching sue's sex show for 2 hours instead. that lady knows her stuff, no bones about it. oh i love a good pun. up early (for a 7am date?) saturday to be at initiation by 9am. that's a good time. then out to a lunch with the pres. elect, Dr. Hatch! such a cute oldish guy, and so easy to talk to. we really had a good time! studied, gym, dinner at moe's (didn't say it til we were already ordering... TOO LATE). rented hero, bed late, slept in on sunday, and back to campus to work for the entire day.  don't you love when you dont do anything all weekend and have to cram all day sunday? boy i do ;) yeah so let's see... monday through now has really just been school stuff. but the big news that's getting me through the week is the north v. south case race tomorrow night! i can't wait! i've never done one before, case race virgin? but i'm already trash talkin like it's my job. maybe it could be. anybody hiring a trash talker? i'm your gal. amy and i are gonna make a group dinner and then a case race to follow! think north! go yanks! see vicky, you and i DO like the same team :) and now it's weds. morning, and all that's standing between me and a victory is my take-home midterm for indie film that's due tomorrow at 1:30. can you dig it? so bon voyage to all those leaving for spring break, and don't forget your blow up dolls.  and watch out for the testicular shrinkosis, it'll get ya when you least expect it. or when you have a chem test. over and out, bitches.

      beginning! whoa that guy has a lot of stickers on his laptop! i can't even see the actual computer. i think he's a little overzealous about decoration. Much like crazy laptop sticker boy, I saw a girl in the library today who brought her own manual pencil sharpener! like the ones from elementary school that you turn the handle for! i could believe it AND right after i giggled at her some weird old man walked by and commented on it too. maybe she does it for attention. she wasn't loved as a child, and now she carries her manual pencil sharpener around. could be that OR could be that she's just a little odd... ok i know what you're waiting for, the good stuff! so friday morning... little mcdonald's run *wink*, too bad no leslie though... she passed out somewhere and we couldn't find her... guess that's why we shouldn't have the morning the day after biker party. duly noted. sing a kappa song, in an opera voice! wha? posted signs around campus for beth's 21st (hair on fire! oh yeah!), got ready for her birthday all afternoon, made jello shots, got dinner, and everyone came up to north for thai food, kings, druno, dance performances by jillian, graham, and beth. beth opened presents... jillian's gift to beth was a lapdance... ooooooh k. lots of wine, lots of jello shots, lots of GREAT pictures that can be viewed <a href="http://beezersphotos.blogspot.com/">HERE</a> ... there was some hat stealing, some george foreman action, some new faces, and by faces i mean mine but new ways to contort it... so overall it was a good party up in north! then off to brookwood where team leprechans were dominating! 6 games in a row? now you tell me that's not incredible! yeah that's right. off to bed early because we started pretty early, too. saturday... and duke here we come! mc and i piled in amy's car and 1 1/2 later we were at the washington duke! everyone took our parking spots, and amy's shoes hate her, sad. greeted by overly dressed and awkward looking 15 year olds, not a prom? what's going on in there? next step, find beth's fam's room. approach front desk. tell them, last name hopkins, he, lispy lynn, he again, asks for the first names, most likely the parents. uhhhh.... it starts with a k! kathy! oh and kathy and kathy and JIM! JIM AND KATHY KATHY AND JIM! he starts giggling, or i guess, continues giggling at three crazy girls, gives us the room number and off we go! went to an AMAZING four course meal with endless flowing wine! no clue how much i had because the waiter would swoop in as soon as i took two sips. fine by me. so 18 people, SO much wine, let's say things just got a little control... breaking glasses, yelling fuck multiple times in the crowded fancy restaurant, endless toasts devolving into a primal yell and the raising of glasses. beth's fam is great, and i thank them for facilitating her 21st birthday, definitely a tough one to out do! we had a great time! then out to a club... george's? had a few run ins with TOOOOONNNNNNYYYY, oh yes, we remember you. pink pants rocked it, alex didn't, and beth's aunt was definitely grinding with a 25year old. while her husband was there. i hope i can be a hot 40 year old, here's to it! Back pretty early, but stayed up pretty late because crang and beth were way too entertaining to ignore. did you just say that the pizza guy was like the sopranos? WHAT? no clue but got a laughing fit out of it. checked out duke's campus early on sunday, and HELLO SPEEDBUMPS! who make speed bumps the same color as the road! not fair! and not fun after a big night of wine. back to wake, did some work, took care of sick boy, and yes i was wearing a slutty nurses uniform... stethoscope anyone? hit up some meetings, watched the duke game (sad news!), worked and went to bed. up early for some gym time, classes all day, library for a while, tons of errands, chapter time, and studied until LATE NIGHT! and hello tuesday, what did i do that day? hit the gym, classes, yeah where am i going with this? let's just say it was one long day! weds., went running, studied for le midterm, classes, midterm, meetings, and then i had to watch 'blue velvet' for film class. i really liked it but it's different? david lynch, first run in with him. ok so i go to get the movie from the reserve counter and they freak out and don't want me to take it because the last person that had it didn't bring it back for several months. so she's like you can't leave the library! and you must give us some collateral! granted i have an apple and that's about it, she wasn't too excited about that. so they took my driver's liscence? what? ok fine yeah can i have the movie now please? so of course, just my luck, when i return the movie it turns out that a new shift of people are working so they have no clue what i'm talking about or where my liscence would be. so long story short, it took ten minutes for me to finally get it worked out. silly libes. y6y4 <-- that was bruce. he's antsy for attention. and he thinks that by bothering me he'll get it. we'll see... ok i have to go to my movie now, more david lynch, mullhulland drive, but i'll finish this up later tonight!

      ahhhhhhh yeah, but no. ok so i wrote on... thursday? no friday i think before the date function? who knows? hold please. haha oh yes, i wrote while i was keeping bruce from his paper. sorry about that one... he only stayed up until 3am to write it... oops. went to bed late, and up early for class! only had one class because my second one was (halla) cancelled. how'd we like that halla? aptly placed? too white girl? yeah i'll try to be more discreet with that next time. so back to north to make some pregame mixes and some cheesecakes! the mixes were great and the cheesecakes? a little burnt, but they'll do. spent the rest of the afternoon just prepping for the date function, grabbed take out for our dates, cat-called a speed walker (three times!), hid lee in the trunk, and almost hit a blind person on his way to see anti-gone! headed over to bruce's with mc, beth, lee, charley, and richard (jillian comes later!). had dinner and LOTS of wine and played catch phrase and druno. bruce played three cards at once to go out? sure why not. and what is so appealing about a walk-in closet? i never knew before. yeah so bruce and i leave the living room for like 5 minutes, and when we come back, all the little couples had gotten with their date and were having 3 independent conversations? what happened? love in the air? hmmm. or hmmm? who can really tell. off to the date function! quite drunk already, good cab and bus ride, saw a bunch of people i think, did a lot of dancing i know, and headed home! GREAT NIGHT! except for waiting an hour for a cab at 2am, not fun. but thanks to the kap sig pledge who took us home! went to the bball game, still drunk? a little. grabbed some lunch, hung out in north, saw jillybean's LOVE BITE (thanks to charley...). funniest part? she went to breakfast and the game with her dad without even noticing it until the game was over. SO BAD, but terribly funny. over to bruce's for the duke vs md game. saw tubgirl and almost vomited, really really gross and bad and she should be shot, or put in an institution. either way keep her away from tubs and cameras. went over to tim/john/nick's place for some beer pong and other things, bad mix? yup. face burn? almost. but they had the cutest little black lab- yeager. aww precious. i'm sure i took pictures of it, who really knows? up sunday morning around 1, had breakfast and watched the bball game, aaaaaaaaaand back to bed... so i went home around 5 that day, sweet. good i'm not a waste of space or anything! LOTS of work, unfun. Monday- Valentine's Day! Classes and homework until 7:20, then a hot date with my valentine for thai food. then our v-day radio show... and why was martha chasing jillian around with her (used) tickler? poor jillian has had enough trauma this week! back to bruce's for cheesecake and wine, compliments of moi, and some wonderful late night tv! perfect valentine's day, and i can't wait until the trip to the wine vineyard this april, quite amazing. could NOT get out of bed to save my life today, but did and hit up two meetings and two classes. so hot right now. had a fun fam dinner, recap of the date function, then to charley &amp; john's to watch wake (barely) kick some hurricane tushy. good week coming up, goin out tomorrow, girls here for dinner and oc and biker party on thursday, and beth's bday celebration this weekend! goin out for nights in a row? insanity. welcome to college, now i'm out to do the other thing we college folk do... HOMEWORK BLAHHHHH. halla. (better?)

      they're selling 'v-cards' in benson right across from where they're giving out free valentine's day condoms... does that make any sense? anyone want to buy back their virginity and then have sex with these pretty red condoms? well it's interesting anyway, when else can you get away with having a huge sign in benson with V-CARDS written on it? god i'm so out of practice of this blogging thing. quick sidenote- why are things always funnier when you're in a place where you have to be quiet? i'm in the library (working hard, as always!) and something funny just took place and because i can't laugh loudly, it made me laugh that much harder! damn forbidden laughter in the floors of the house of books! ok so quick recap on the month of january? gorsh where do i begin? here's the vague/obscure/will probably only get it if you've been around recap: long days at rush, james dean's note on my car, jillian's music videos, sushi and wine nights (monkey wine=blackout for someone? mmm?), getting 'halla-ed' at by one of my profs, charming my way into a class, late night drunk calls to steph's parents, catch phrase, tickle/wrestle fights, kenny the cab man, trival drinking pursuit, break dance dance offs, rubber bands on, rubber bands off..., homemade pancakes on snowy mornings, wake bball games, drinking heavily with MC before the wake duke game, risque sex board games that creighton bought and danielle walking in on her explaining it, scary visitors outside of north, stolen shopping baskets (is this a yearbook entry?) (no? just trying to throw all the random memorable stuff in there), pledge night like no other- where's the roof?, lisa being sly, sneak a fifth into brew's? yes. saw 'sideways', couple of friend dinners, beer pong in the basement, beer bonging avec ski/swim outfit, jane's bday, gin slushies, double double talk talk, lisa lisa have a beer beer, amazing indie film class & amazing english sem. class, and above all SO HAPPY TO HAVE EVERYONE BACK FROM BEING ABROAD. to steph, amy, bruce, etc., we missed you! and now look at our dinners, HUGE. and lest i forget, nights of porn, both in the apt and libes, O.C. addictions beginning and ending, radio shows, toolness, receiving drunk dials on a monday night, half naked passed out girls in random apartments (not me!) and making cookies to make up for it (seriously though, not me), endless quoting of nap. dyn., scary paralyzing dreams during naps from which i wake up my roommate and myself by screaming, staying in bed until 3pm on a saturday because we can, drunken campouts, sleeping bags, giggly john, bain bands, lost scarves... stolen scarves? danni??? ooooooooooooh nooooooooooooooo. my entertaining faces and voices... bahhhhhh, animated panda? cheese drawers that are NOT filled with chesse, more house hunting and finding an AMAZING one, chuckles and his late night 'beer pong,' total wine, crang and graham tension arguing--> hot hookup? nope. and here we are. well the month of january just flew by coherently didn't it? at least i may say this: not once did i shower before my thursday classes, and i'm damn proud of it. who knew lisa could go out three nights a week? it's a new semester, my friends. here's to an amazing spring, cheers! check back soon, i'm pledging to keep up with this so i can actually explain what the hell my stories mean. goal= twice a week. i think that's do-able.  Tomorrow is our first date function of the semester- wild blue yonder, and it's going to be just that... WILD! let's just say we have 7 large bottles of wine for 8 people, and that's just to pregame :) keep your eyes open for new (and incriminating?!?!?!) stories and pictures! and i'll be back by monday with entertainment. night night and welcome back to my world of insanity. you're welcome.

      isn't that sick? well i'm not updating now, i'm updating tonight (yes i am!) and not the full blown 'this is what i did for EVERYDAY OF JANUARY AND FEBRUARY UP UNTIL NOW, just a quick overview to get back into the swing of things. this resurgence in blogging, if i may prompt, is caused by a little procrastinating irishlady who, studying for her test last night, was not happy that i was unable to fuel her procrastinating:
irishcheer21 (12:11:11 AM): i'm warning you lisa katerman
irishcheer21 (12:11:47 AM): if i come back from chicago and while procrastinating for writing my papers/presentation on sunday night click your "tempting isn't it" and i find "say neigh" entry... i will personally hunt you down
irishcheer21 (12:11:52 AM): don't tempt me if it's not tempt me
irishcheer21 (12:11:58 AM): *tempting
irishcheer21 (12:12:21 AM): and girl, you don't want to see me hunt, i'm a warrior

so there you have it, the wrath of amy fueling the continuing blogging of lisa. good day.

      no explanation needed. ok so let's set the scene, 4 girls alone in a cabin with yummy take-out, lots of christmas presents, movies to watch, and plenty of drinks to go around! champange, gin, and beer galore! so we first opened christmas presents, thanks for all the great gifts, girls! so much fun. right so then onto drinks and the movie, Napoleon Dynamite, and if you haven't seen it yet  go see it now! GOSH! heck yes! then more drinks, cranium, champange and new years countdown! then several drunk phone calls, chugging with meghan, and lots of cranium later, we went to bed! more stories could be told, but let's be honest i don't know who reads this and i'd hate to reveal too much, i'll just leave it to the imgaination. but i will tell you that i had to act out a certain sex position during cranium. THAT"S why i love that game. up saturday morning for some clean up and breakfast, girls took off, i cleaned up all afternoon, watched the rose bowl with the fam (close one! good job texas!). Next day, slept late, packed for school, then left for harrisburg! at which my parents did a little goodbye dance, wow they're really going crazy. it's actually the dance from three amigos that lucky and ned do when they meet the real el guapo. hilarious. sad to say goodbye to them, but they might visit in the spring, so that'll be fun! drove to my aunt's in harrisburg, had dinner with her and my brother and my uncle, then we all just sat around and played lots of cards and talked forever.  went to bed, up for breakfast, hung out at the cabin for a while, met kelly (my cousin and my aunt's daughter= cousin) for lunch, went back to the house, read, and hung out. then about 15 minutes before my aunt has to go teach her back to back tai chi classes, she gets a call, and all i hear from here were things like 'are you ok? are you hurt?' all these scary questions. long story short, my aunt's crazy friend from HIGH SCHOOL apparently had a nervous breakdown and had to see my aunt. so she came by after my aunt came back from class her crazy friend and her boyfriend were there. wow this lady was nuts. she was on 6 meds, seeing a psychologist, therapist, group therapy, and psychiatrist! yikes! ok so that was the excitement for the night! left early the next morning, drove to wake, unpacked, long meeting de recuitment, out to dinner, and to bed. up today for errands, meeting, lunch, gym, dinner, stories, and bed! that's now! so here i go! ciao ciao! up early for a big fun day of the first day of recruitment! nighty

      ok so i'm going to head to harrisburg in about an hour, but i wanted to write a quick update before i head out! ok so off to atlanta i went ( a week ago today!) but not easily. mom dropped me off at the airport, and i checked in where they gave me not a seat assignment, but a seat request form ?! didn't really think anything of it, went through security and had a glass of wine in the sports bar, because i can, and again, no carding! down with authority! so i went to my gate an hour before we were boarding, and not only was the flight delayed an hour, but i was put on standby! what? yeah. so long story short (i actually was prepared to cry and throw a tantrum if they didn't let me on, drama works so well!), a couple decided not to take the flight to atlanta because they definitely would've missed their connection in atlanta, so basically the only reason i got on the plane was because it was delayed. things work in mysterious ways! got to atlanta around 10pm, not so spanish looking bruce was there and we waited in a sea of luggage to get my bag. good thing for talking loudly, and thanks to random lady for seeing my bag! walked out to economy parking (nicely done) and eventually found the car, and several minutes of driving around the parking lot, we found the exit! off to a good start! met bruce's mom and brothers, sat around and chatted for a while, played some ping pong, had a conversation with my stomach, and all of a sudden it was 5:30am? up the next morning before noon, went to marietta (sp?) square and walked around on a GORGEOUS day! spent an hour in the magic shop, trying on masks, mustaches, and hats. got some coffee, drove through walker, and back to his house. his mom made a great dinner, then we showered up, played a game of pool (victorious was i!) and headed out to kevin's house. made a quick stop at the liquor store for gin and rum ( i was carded! finally!), ran into the guys in the parking lot, bizarre, hit up the grocery store to find a mixer, but no good! couldn't find tonic water or fanta! so we took a shot with fresca, and it was amazing! fresca + gin = best drink ever. went to kevin's, met all the friends, played some beer pong, ludicris's arms are NOT that big, had some tastey morsels, and had a great time. and for future reference to anyone who ever eats with kevin: always chew with your mouth closed, because if you don't, he will take away your stuffed shells. slept over that night, went back to bruce's later that day and were pretty much wastes of space all day. played some cards, that was something. took charcoal (their black lab) for a walk in this really nice mountain park place until it was dark and the crazies came out. got back, showered, and out to dinner with the whole family! hibachi, very delicious! then to borders for coffee and browsing and off to see 'life aqatic'! great movie, i really liked it. i need to see it again soon! back to bruce's, fell asleep watching cartoons, and then to bed! wednesday... slept late, went to little five points to shop around, and i found the bed that i want for my house, eventually. four poster bed with a kind of net thing all around it, covered in pillows. so comfy! don't sit on the furniture! oops. went in a ton of great stores, could've stayed there all day, bought only one thing though! a cardboard james dean stand up! yay!!!! he's SO coming to the house next year! went to dinner in buckhead at a fantastic restaurant called tu tu tango, really good food and amazing atmosphere, too bad the tarot lady was busy! went to another amazing place, cafe intermezzo (i feel like there's another syllable in there...) for coffee and dessert. so beautiful inside! had some great coffee drinks, split a piece of turtle cheescake (so delicious!), and sat and talked for a few hours. back to the house, had christmas, and stayed up until about 20 minutes before we had to get up. oops! drove to the airport at 7:30am, not fun, said goodbye, and back to PA i went! eric and dad picked me up in harrisburg and i slept the whole way home. 2 hours later the girls arrived! went out to dinner and to see 'the aviator' (SO good!). hung out at the cabin for a while, and to bed around 2! up the next morning for breakfast with the cousins, off to get my hair colored, and back to the house for some ping pong! out to lunch that afternoon with the girls and mom, ran some errands, came home and went in the hot tub, and brought our stuff over to the cabin for new years eve fun! i've gotta take off, but i'll continue with the new years fiasco later this week! so we're on friday night, right , friday night! happy new year to all! cheer for wake tonight in their big game! ciao ciao!
