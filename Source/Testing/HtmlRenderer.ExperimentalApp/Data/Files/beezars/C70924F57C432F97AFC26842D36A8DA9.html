				<h1>Gateway to the Driftless Area or the Dells</h1>
				
				<p>Nancy</p>

				<p>Our location places us within easy distance of the Dells, Kickapoo Valley Reserve, the State Bike 
				Trail system, the best motorcycle touring routes in the state, and Wildcat State Park.  The options are available 
				to design a great time, from water rides of the Dells to horseback riding or canoeing in the Kickapoo Valley Reserve.  
				For many years, this area has been an undiscovered as a tourist attraction. The Driftless Area is unique in the state as it 
				is untouched by glaciers.  Scenic bluffs and beautiful valleys are filled with cross road villages, small towns, Amish
				communities and rural folk.
				<br></br>
				Efforts have been put in place to maintain a non-commercial approach to servicing tourism.  You will find local individuals providing services for 
				canoeing, horseback riding, fly fishing, Amish quilts, quiant shops, and more.  Hotel Hillsboro has the amenities of the larger hotels 
				in the small town setting, filling the need for quality lodging in this area.  We consider ourselves a gateway to the area.  We hope you bring your family, friends, or business activities to this
				area and to Hotel Hillsboro.  Please take advantage of our location, accommodations and facilities for your trip to Southwest Wisconsin.
				
				<br></br>
				We look forward to your visit.</p>
