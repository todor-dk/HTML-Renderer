<br />
<br />
<font face="ariel" color="grey">*   Only one computer (or device) should be turned on at a time when running a Speedtest.  If you have multiple devices connected to your network, some of them may be using the connection and this will slow down the results you see.  For example, if you have a 10 Mbps connection with two computers and one of them is streaming Netflix at 3 Mbps, the Speedtest would only show 7 Mbps.  This is because 10 Mbps - 3 Mbps of Netflix = 7 Mbps.  To get accurate results, test with only one device turned on at a time.</font> 
<br />
<br />
<font face="ariel" color="grey">**   Wireless networks and older wireless routers can often slow down your network.  If you are going to test your speed it is strongly recommended you use a wired connection to your router.  If that cannot be done, then there is a very large number of factors that influence wireless network performance.  Locate your wireless router in the center of your house and do not put it on the floor.  Avoid putting your wireless router near large objects such as an appliance, thick wall, heavy stonework, or tucked into a small spot where it is out of sight.</font>
<br />
<br />
<font face="ariel" color="grey">***   Chariton Valley advertised internet speeds are "up to" speeds.  We do not guarantee speeds because there many factors which can slow down a connection and many of those factors are outside  of our control.</font>
