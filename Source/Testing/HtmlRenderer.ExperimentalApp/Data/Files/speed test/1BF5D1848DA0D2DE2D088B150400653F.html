<h2>Speed Test FAQs</h2>
</center>
<center>
<table width="650">
<tr valign"top">
<td>
<div class="accordion">Why do I get different results if I run the test multiple times&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p>This is due to a number of factors beyond Pioneer’s control which may impact your speed, including (but not limited to) the processing power of your personal computing equipment, applications running on your computer, applications running on other devices in your home network, the nature and quality of your home network connection, third party networks you may be connected to, the performance of the Speedtest webserver during your test and congestion on the Internet.</p></div>

<div class="accordion">Can I test my Pioneer Internet speed using my Tablet or mobile device&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p>Absolutely!  The Speed Test functionality works with multiple device types (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet and Phone) and most major operating systems. You can download the Speedtest app by Ookla from your device's app store. Please note that laptop and desktop computers connected directly to your Pioneer modem typically provide better results than tablets and smartphones.</p></div>
<div class="accordion">How do I get the most accurate Speed Test results&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p><ul>
<li>Close all applications, including streaming video and music.</li>
<li>Connect your computer directly to your modem.</li>
<li>Disconnect your router from the modem or turn off WiFi if using a 2-n-1 router/modem.</li>
<li>Laptop and desktop computers connected directly to your Pioneer modem typically provide better results than tablets and smartphones</li>
</ul></p></div>
<div class="accordion">Does Pioneer Communications guarantee my Internet speed will be the same as my subscription tier&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p>No.  Pioneer Communications does not guarantee that the results of the Speed Test will match your plan subscription 100% of the time.  This is due to a number of factors beyond Pioneer’s control which may impact your speed, including (but not limited to) the processing power of your personal computing equipment, applications running on your computer, the nature and quality of your home network connection, third party networks you may be connected to, the performance of the websites you visit and congestion on the Internet.</p></div>
<div class="accordion">Why are my Wi-Fi speeds slower than my Wired connection speeds&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p>There are many variables that could impact your speed when connected to the Internet through a wireless network. For example, microwaves, static electricity, fluorescent lights, windows, wall type and thickness, the distance between the router and the connecting device, band and signal settings, multiple devices on the same channel, and several other factors can impact the speeds you receive when wirelessly connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>These Wi-Fi variables can add substantial delay (latency and throughput) which may result in speed degradation. A wired connection eliminates many of the potential variables of a wireless network, resulting in improved performance and at least eliminating potential causes of Internet speed issues. </p>

<p>When contacting Pioneer Communications customer care professionals, one of the first steps in diagnosing Internet connection speed issues is to connect the device being tested directly to the modem.  Doing so may allow our service technicians to diagnose and remedy potential issues much faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="accordion">Does the location of my wireless equipment &#x28;routers, gateways, access points, extenders&#x29; affect WiFi performance&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p>Yes, for optimal performance, place the wireless gateway or router in:</p>

<ul>
<li>A central location where client devices will most likely be used</li>
<li>An elevated location, such as a higher shelf, where laptops have a line of sight view</li>
<li>A vertical position</li>
</ul>

<p>Areas to <b><u>avoid </u></b>include:·         </p>

<ul>
<li>Near other interference sources (such as microwaves, high powered appliances, 2.4 GHz cordless phones or other wireless devices close to other Wireless Access Points)</li>
<li>Basements</li>
<li>Next to other Wireless Routers</li>
<li>Near metal objects and surfaces</li>
<li>Against a wall, tucked away in a corner on the floor or behind furniture</li>
<li>Near windows</li>
<li>Close to halogen or florescent lighting</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="accordion">How does the Pioneer Speed Test tool work&#x3f;</div>
<div class="panel"><p><p>Pioneer Communications has partnered with Ookla, a leader in Internet metricsk, and the software checks two primary components of your Internet service – Download and Upload speeds.</p>
<p>The Speedtest operates mainly over TCP testing with a HTTP fallback for maximum compatibility. Speedtest measures <strong>ping</strong> (latency), <strong>download speed</strong> and <strong>upload speed</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>TCP Test Components</h1>
<h2>Latency/Jitter</h2>
<ol>
<li>This test is performed by measuring the time it takes for the server to reply to a request from the your client. The client sends a message to the server, upon receiving that message, the server sends a reply back. The round-trip time is measured in ms (milliseconds).</li>
<li>This test is repeated multiple times with the lowest value determining the final result.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Download</h2>
<ol>
<li>The client establishes multiple connections with the server. The client requests the server to send an initial chunk of data.</li>
<li>The client calculates the real-time speed of the transfers, then adjusts the chunk size and buffer size based on this calculation to maximize usage of the network connection.</li>
<li>As the chunks are received by the client, the client will request more chunks throughout the duration of the test.</li>
<li>During the first half of the test, the client will establish extra connections to the server if it determines additional threads are required to more accurately measure the download speed.</li>
<li>The test ends once the configured amount of time has been reached.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Upload</h2>
<ol>
<li>The client establishes multiple connections with the server and sends an initial chunk of data.</li>
<li>The client calculates the real-time speed of the transfers and adjusts the chunk size and buffer size based on it to maximize usage of the network connection, and requests more data.</li>
<li>As the chunks are received by the server, the client will send more chunks throughout the duration of the test.</li>
<li>During the first half of the test, the client will establish extra connections to the server if it determines additional threads are required to more accurately measure the upload speed.</li>
<li>The test ends once the configured amount of time has been reached. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h1>HTTP Legacy Fallback Testing</h1>
<h2>Latency</h2>
<ol>
<li>This test is performed by measuring the time it takes to get a response for a HTTP request sent to the web server</li>
<li>This test is repeated multiple times with the lowest value determining the final result.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Download</h2>
<ol>
<li>Small binary files are downloaded from the web server to the client to estimate the connection speed</li>
<li>Based on this result, one of several file sizes is selected to use for the real download test</li>
<li>The test is performed with cache prevention via random strings appended to each download</li>
<li>Throughput samples are received at up to 30 times per second</li>
<li>These samples are then aggregated into 20 slices (each being 5% of the samples)</li>
<li>The remaining slices are averaged together to determine the final result</li>
</ol>
<h2>Upload Test</h2>
<ol>
<li>A small amount of random data is generated in the client and sent to the web server to estimate the connection speed.</li>
<li>Based on this result, an appropriately sized chunk of randomly generated data is selected for upload.</li>
<li>The upload test is then performed in chunks of uniform size, pushed to the server-side script via POST.</li>
<li>We'll use up to four HTTP threads here, as well, to saturate the connection.</li>
<li>Chunks are sorted by speed, and the fastest half is averaged to eliminate anomalies and determine the result.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition to Download and Upload speeds, the tool provides additional information about the Latency and Jitter of the connection, and your current IP Address.</p>
