<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<div class="disclaimer">
Your online encounter depends on more than just the level of service that you have obtained from TEC. At the time you visit a site or use some other sort of online utility, the information that you send and accept ventures:
	<ol>
		<li>between your computer and your modem or gateway</li>
		<li>through the telephone wires that run throughout your home or business</li>
		<li>through the Network Interface Device on the outside of your building and to the TEC network, and then</li>
		<li>out to the Internet, which consists of millions of private networks</li>
	</ol>
The service competence speed of your TEC connection only affects item three in the list above; but your online encounter hinges on the performance of all of those factors. For example, a user with a defectively performing computer, but who is receiving our highest service capability speed for their service type, could actually have a "sluggish" online experience. Similarly, a user with a new computer who is trying to access a website at the same time that millions of other guests are attempting to reach that site may also have a "sluggish" online experience, regardless of the maximum capability of their TEC connection.
<br /><br />
Actual speeds may vary depending on the number, performance, and configuration of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Connected PC or connecting PCs</li>
		<li>Hardware (Processor (Single Core, Multi Core), RAM, Hard Drive (write speed capabilities))</li>
		<li>Router and connecting adapters (Gigabit Ethernet required for 100M)</li>
		<li>Software Applications</li>
		<li>Web Browser/Browser Plug-ins (Flash/Java)</li>
		<li>Website/Server Limitations (Not all speed test sites are capable of testing 100M)</li>
		<li>Network Congestion</li>
	</ul>
For optimal performance, contact your equipment manufacturer/software developer for required upgrades, configuration redesigns, or troubleshooting guides.
