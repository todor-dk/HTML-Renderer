I think he’s a phenomenal leader; Uber is ridiculously interesting.”\nMayer's speculation flies in the face of news reports that indicate that Kalanick was, at best, aware of and, at worst, directly responsible for many of the incidents revealed in the lead-up to his departure from the company.\nMayer, who stepped down from her Yahoo post this month after the company's sale to Verizon was complete, has had her name floated as a possible replacement for the Uber chief.

That's up from 21 in 2016, which was a drop-off from years' past. \nOf course, it's still not that many—6.4 percent of the top companies' leaders, to be precise. Fortune started tracking America's top 500 companies in 1955. \nThe ranking is of the top companies in America by size as measured by revenue. The list spans industries with names like Apple, Walmart, and AT&T alongside energy companies and insurance companies you've probably never heard of. \nSEE ALSO: Here's what women in tech actually think about their employers\nThe top company on the list led by a woman is General Motors, with CEO Mary Barra, at No. 8. GM is the only company in the top 10—or 20, or 30—with a woman at the helm. \nOf the 32 women CEOs leading Fortune 500 companies, only two are women of color: Indra Nooyi at Pepsi and Geisha Williams at PG&E.

Missing that one important email because your inbox is cluttered with garbage. \nBut it doesn't have to be that way. \nSEE ALSO: The best thing you can do to protect yourself from hackers\nThankfully, there are numerous tricks you can use to make sure that you see the emails you want to see, when you want to see them. While the specifics of your digital streamlining will vary depending on your email provider of choice, that's OK! We're here to break it all down for you, nice and easy like. \nGmail\nGoogle's Gmail offers up numerous options to flag important incoming emails, and even employs one of them by default. The default flag is called an \"importance marker,\" and it's slapped on an email after Google's fancy algorithms have used a variety of factors to determine that it's worth giving a damn about. \nThose factors include, but are not limited to, practical considerations like \"who you email, and how often you email them,\" \"which emails you open,\" and \"which emails you reply to.\"\nIf Google does decide an email is worthy of an importance marker, you'll see what looks like a little rightward-facing arrow in your inbox pointing to the message in question. If you only want to see emails marked in this way, search \"is:important\" in your inbox search bar. \nBut what if this default option isn't a good fit? What if Gmail's importance markers miss your actually important stuff and only serve to confuse you? \nThat's totally cool, because there are more tools in the Gmail toolshed.\n\nYour first step after deciding to ditch importance markers should be to disable the feature. You can do this by logging into your account (via browser) and clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right corner. Next, select \"settings\" and then click \"inbox.\" Scroll down to \"importance markers\" and select \"no markers.\" \nThat's it. You're free of Google deciding what emails you should read, and, conversely, what you should ignore. \nThe magic of filters\nThat means it's time to set up your own filters. The obvious one it to mark specific people as being really important: Your boss, your partner, your best friend, or your lawyer are people whose emails you wouldn't want to miss. \nThe steps to mark specific senders as important are relatively straightforward. First, type the person's email address in your browser search bar. After you search for them, select the \"more\" drop-down menu then choose \"create filter.\" The next part looks tricky, but if you've made it this far into this story you can definitely manage. Make sure the important email address is in the \"from\" field, and then select \"create filter with this search.\" \nThe next screen gives you the option to have Gmail star future message from that sender, mark them as important, or to make sure those messages stay out of the spam folder. For truly important people, we recommend you check all three.\n\nDon't forget to hit \"create filter,\" and you're done. \nEasy, right? Now you'll never miss another vital email in your Gmail account (jk — you totally still will every now and then, but that's because you're a human being).\nOutlook Mail\nMicrosoft makes it easy to designate emails as deserving of special attention, and goes one step further by allowing you to automatically pin messages to the top of your inbox. \nThat's right, whenever that email from your mom comes in it will stay front and center. \nTo turn on auto-pin, search for an email from said mom (she's bound to have sent you at least one) and, once you have it open, click on the \"more commands\" ellipsis in the toolbar. Next, choose \"create rule\" and make sure the condition for \"it was received from\" is both selected and has your mom's name in it. Then, remove any conditions that don't apply and then click the \"move the message to folder\" drop-down menu. After selecting \"pin the message,\" don't forget to hit \"OK\" in the upper-left hand corner. \nYou have now mastered the Outlook Mail pin.\nTo designate a specific sender as important you can follow the same pinning steps up until the last part, and instead of selecting \"pin the message\" just choose the \"mark the message\" \"with importance\" option. \nBoom. Easy. Kinda.\nYahoo! Mail\nThe first, and perhaps most important step you should take when using Yahoo! Mail is to stop using Yahoo! Mail (we only sort of kid). If you like the interface for whatever reason, or just don't want to give up that totally sick \"yournamecool@yahoo.com\" handle then there are some measures you can take to prioritize messages from the all stars in your life. \n\nStart things off by creating a new folder in your inbox and titling it something like \"Boss Baby.\" Next, make sure emails from any important people are automatically sent to that folder. \nIt's simple enough to do: Open an email from one of your very Boss Baby-like friends or colleagues and select the \"more\" drop-down menu. \nNow, click on \"filter emails like this.\" The \"from\" field should include the address of your special person (you can add more than one address in the field), and, when you've added all the appropriate email addresses, choose your folder labeled \"Boss Baby\" from the \"then move the message to this folder\" drop-down tab. Lastly, click \"save\" and you're good to go!\nYou still have a Yahoo! Mail account, but at least it's modestly organized now. \nThe ugly truth\nThe reality of email these days is that even with the above steps, stuff you actually give a hoot about is still going to get lost in the mix. With that in mind, the best approach is might actually be to have multiple email accounts (I have five that I use regularly, and several other throwaways). \nIt sounds like a pain, but it's not really. Almost everyone reading this likely has at least two different email accounts (work and personal) already. Try breaking out your personal accounts into themed groups. One account could be tied to all your social media accounts, a second tied to your friends, family, and banking, and yet another for any service or list that you need to sign up for. Then, within each account, go ahead and follow the steps outlined earlier in this piece. \nThis approach will take you a while to set up, but it is oh so sweet when you have it dialed in. And when you finally do, you can rest easy knowing that no notification from Facebook will ever again drown out that email from Grandma.\nWATCH: Man convinces email scammer he's flown to Hong Kong for Kit Kats and $13.9 million"},"shares":{"facebook":440,"pinterest":13,"linked_in":124,"google_plus":58,"twitter":821,"total":1456},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/R3iITHedddANphM6xwXceqVi1hY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F464776%2F4339f6f1-347c-46f9-a0c5-0791c08bd67c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xnYBskYx1HlNn1dJWoemiXUifZ0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dSgbgWxbC9IeemSho4TOmtwCCtM=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aDimR3Lj_zYBTLhaKnTB-CgBW7E=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pUia99","display_title":"How to fix your chaotic nightmare of an email inbox","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"kqNR7cSt","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Email is messy, but it doesn't have to be.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How to fix your chaotic nightmare of an email inbox"},{"_id":"5902418328cc366330000031","id":"2017/04/27/us-senate-email-security-2fa","title":"Surprise!

Like, senators can't turn it on even if they want to. \n\"As you know, the cybersecurity and foreign intelligence threats directed at Congress aresignificant,\" wrote Wyden in the letter addressed to two Senate colleagues. \"However, the Senate is far behind when it comes to implementing basic cybersecurity practices like two-factor authentication.\"\nWhat exactly is two-factor authentication (2FA), and why does this matter? Let's let the experts over at the Electronic Frontier Foundation explain. \n\"Login systems that require only a username and password risk being broken when someone else can obtain (or guess) those pieces of information,\" notes the organization. \"Services that offer two-factor authentication also require you to provide a separate confirmation that you are who you say you are. The second factor could be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to confirm who you are.\"\nAn easy-to-grasp example of 2FA is your bank ATM card. In order to withdraw cash, you need the PIN (something you know) and the card itself (something you have). Those two factors combine to allow you, and hopefully only you, to access to your hard-earned dollars.\n\nWith 2FA turned on, even if someone gains your email password (like maybe just possibly through a phishing attack) they still lack the necessary credentials to get into your inbox. This seems like something sitting members of the United States Senate and their staff would be interested in, right?\nAnd yet.\n\"Today, the Senate neither requires nor offers two-factor authentication as an additionalprotection for desktop computers and email accounts,\" writes Wyden. \"The Senate Sergeant at Arms does require two-factor authentication for staff who wish to log in to Senate IT systems from home, using a Virtual Private Network. This is a good first step, but the Senate must go further and embrace two-factor authentication for the workplace, and not just for staff connecting from home.\"\nOffering 2FA is often viewed as one of several basic security litmus tests for online services. Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, AOL, and even the much-maligned Yahoo Mail make it easy to turn this on — meaning your grandmother's email account is potentially more secure than your senator's.\nAs that depressing little nugget of information sinks in, Wyden hits us with a jaw-dropping follow. The executive branch, you see, offers employees Personal Identity Verification (PIV) cards which contain smart chips. The chips work as part of a 2FA system for employees to log into computers. The senate also offers PIV cards, Wyden tells us, but these don't have smart chips.\nWhat do they have instead?\n\"[In] contrast to the executive branch's widespread adoption of PIV cards with a smartchip, most senate staff ID cards have a photo of a chip printed on them, rather than a real chip.\"\nThat's right, a photo of a chip printed on them.\nSo, to recap: Senate email accounts aren't protected by 2FA, and most Senate staff ID cards have fake smart chips. \nNext on the agenda, we assume, is the revelation that the password to each and every senators' personal voicemail account is just \"0000.\" \nWATCH: Edward Snowden says Russians probably hacked the NSA\n\n  "},"shares":{"facebook":226,"google_plus":17,"linked_in":49,"twitter":459,"pinterest":4,"total":755},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PnJJAVKw4ro61fFvLCFvy3HiMZ4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F459047%2F2f29c3f5-1b27-41cb-a56d-6f0cee6730b9.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Y4RI9Tlz1dHF3Qhegn8FRH2O0wU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43982%2Fdafb0c6a-f5f5-4fc6-8b6f-a965879fecab.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/k1Xa9kMQp6fv3Q22xfbErw8hQO8=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43982%2Fdafb0c6a-f5f5-4fc6-8b6f-a965879fecab.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q18HKoOA941-Zi4sHPKdYSoLt7s=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43982%2Fdafb0c6a-f5f5-4fc6-8b6f-a965879fecab.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pqAs3B","display_title":"Surprise!

The $186 million is a far bigger number than had been previously revealed in regulatory filings. Mayer's payday could been even bigger if not for a penalty assessed by the company in response to Mayer's handling of Yahoo's massive data breaches.\nThe former Google exec took over the massive but declining tech company in 2012. She proved unable to push Yahoo into the future, with its main business of online display advertising continuing to decline, tempered only slightly by efforts to get more into mobile and video advertising.\n\nMarissa Mayer was #Google's 1st female #engineer & 20th employee when she started there in 1999. pic.twitter.com/qImn5752cp— Susan Dolan (@GoogleExpertUK) April 24, 2017\n\nThat didn't matter much thanks to Yahoo's sizable investment in Alibaba, the massive ecommerce company that went public in 2014. The stake had made Yahoo an appealing way for U.S. investors to invest in Alibaba before its IPO, helping to drive up Yahoo's share price in the mean time. \nThe Alibaba stake also ended up forcing Mayer into a role she didn't necessarily want to inhabit — that of the CEO shopping her company. Investors in Yahoo, eager to avoid tax hits and maximize their return on the Alibaba investment, pushed Mayer to sell Yahoo's core business to another company. \nThat company ended up being Verizon, which is set to buy Yahoo for about $4.5 billion (the original deal was renegotiated and $350 million removed from the price due to the data breaches).  \nMayer reportedly wont be sticking around after the sale, despite having written a blog in which she detailed that she planned to stay. \nTough break. At least there's 186 million parting gifts.\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to clarify that Mayer's stock in Yahoo was accrued as part of her compensation and was not acquired as part of the sale to Verizon.\n\nWATCH: This Star Wars-like flying car is everyone's dream come true"},"shares":{"facebook":132,"pinterest":4,"twitter":305,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":298,"total":746},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zpFmQOm2hP1TILbVKlAceDOAR1s=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F457450%2F52f3d8db-2f7d-4099-ac36-2bea120fba64.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d0jBN6TFkpfSL7ZYG-YTsMCCQu8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/A8VR-ckJWmbAHa8h2S32bT9Peyo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/o-1RLxNKUGvdD3Rg5NMBw0HTelU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e4lDBsCBOnHpCnCM0wXNDpmOidA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vNbNas3F4OFSqiKx9Lb-wt9c9zE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2qbaZrY","display_title":"Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is sitting on stock worth $186 million","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"kUZGmtlp","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Best.

AOL is also still a pretty big name. \nMerging AOL and Yahoo does not come as a surprise, as Verizon's goal in buying Yahoo was to create a group of internet destinations with enough visitors so it could provide something of an alternative to the digital duopoly of Google and Facebook. \nUpdate: Yahoo's own Yahoo Finance reports that the Yahoo brand will not go away, but rather remain as a media brand under \"Oath\" and alongside Verizon's other media entities.\nThe \"Oath\" news quickly brought on comparisons to tronc, which is the name that the iconic Tribune Publishing company transitioned to as part of its move to embrace the internet. \nAnd, like tronc, Twitter had a few jokes at the expense of \"Oath.\"\n\nTROATHNC— Nick Baumann (@NickBaumann) April 3, 2017\n\nLol, Oath.— BuzzFeed Tech (@fwd) April 3, 2017\n\nyahoo aolyahooaolhooaolhoooaahhhhodoroath— Seth Fiegerman (@sfiegerman) April 3, 2017\n\nThe last “oath” Yahoo took was to keep my email safe and WELLLLLL— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) April 3, 2017\n\n@rklein90 @aterkel Huffington Oath— Peter Sterne (@petersterne) April 3, 2017\n\nWATCH: There and back: Elon Musk's SpaceX makes history with epic rocket launch and landing"},"shares":{"google_plus":6,"facebook":282,"linked_in":23,"twitter":440,"pinterest":2,"total":753},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HUfJf0Z36qVhu2zaekfdJOCSnAQ=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F435777%2Ffa977454-3f32-4a95-bb24-14f5fee81b06.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KrQeUf1mQ5GNtBaoWt_UaGEADTE=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F41718%2Fcdfa6155-1597-4c34-a5ff-43fc866700a1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zUq6qigcW7K1Gv3dSm5Kk_pPmdE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F41718%2Fcdfa6155-1597-4c34-a5ff-43fc866700a1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bS42nMY2SRiWhG1wor7zPI8C3ag=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F41718%2Fcdfa6155-1597-4c34-a5ff-43fc866700a1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IgdW5WNk6NxoqVUt5mF3D9pSCuM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F41718%2Fcdfa6155-1597-4c34-a5ff-43fc866700a1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rqc_SGG6QJZreJT-Qml4xkA5rJs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F41718%2Fcdfa6155-1597-4c34-a5ff-43fc866700a1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2nC0GMt","display_title":"Yahoo + AOL = Oath?

The hesitation ultimately led to a $350 million discount for the telecom.\nThe company also said earlier this month that Mayer would lose her usual bonus payment this year after an internal investigation revealed that executives had mishandled the hacks.\nSEE ALSO: Marissa Mayer is giving up a ton of money over Yahoo's data breach\nThe sum released Monday is also just more than half of the $44 million reported in a previous filing last fall. The figure is only lower today because Mayer has since collected $21 million of that total in the form of vested stock options. \nPer the terms of the deal, Verizon will absorb the bulk of Yahoo's operations while the remaining business will be renamed Altaba.\nMayer has said she plans to step down from the board of that company -- which will essentially be just a management firm for the company's shares of e-commerce giant Alibaba. Another board member, Thomas McInerney, will take her place as CEO.\nIt's less clear whether Mayer will still have a hand in running Yahoo's online operations once Verizon is in charge. She previously said last summer that she planned to stay, a decision that was met with surprise and skepticism from investors.\nThe bonus loss and the slashed severance aren't likely to be much of a blow for Mayer's personal finances.

Which is, you know, slightly more than 26.\nMayer's statement, which vastly understates the impact of the hack and her involvement in everything that followed, refers to \"26 specifically targeted users\" in the 2014 breach. Those compromised accounts may have helped the hackers access databases that ultimately affected hundreds of millions of people.\nThe document filed with the SEC Wednesday states \"certain senior executives did not properly comprehend or investigate, and therefore failed to act sufficiently upon\" the initial breach in 2014. No kidding.\n\nYahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the post.\nOf course, Mayer is still worth hundreds of millions of dollars, despite her gracious decision to sacrifice some more. The CEO's base pay is $1 million. As of August of 2016, she held Yahoo stock options and restricted stock units valued at over $85 million.\nIn 2015, she received a total compensation package of $36 million, $14.5 million in stock grants and $19.9 million in options.\nIn related news, the company reported Wednesday that they believe 32 million user accounts were victims of a previously reported cyberattack using \"forged cookies,\" or small files that can be used to hack into an account without a password.\nYahoo's general counsel and secretary Ronald S. Bell resigned from the company Wednesday.  Mayer is expected to step down from Yahoo's executive board after the Verizon deal is officially finalized, according to a regulatory filing with the Securities Exchange Commission.\nBONUS: Apple's new 'Apple Park' spaceship campus will open in April"},"shares":{"facebook":200,"twitter":304,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":9,"stumble_upon":1574,"pinterest":2,"total":2101},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Mu3KVvqWBetIA_wIU5JZvQjgtUY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F400932%2F2052adcd-def3-43d4-884d-200d18c60449.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cwgAtUNLwY2p8uxtrvRz3bErDek=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38397%2Ff450f909-1d19-409b-8881-7cae292ed4e2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4A-YEpim50DEwcunL4PmzSvphR4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38397%2Ff450f909-1d19-409b-8881-7cae292ed4e2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cl9Y2aQYjk89fFXDa09Nlhb91LE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38397%2Ff450f909-1d19-409b-8881-7cae292ed4e2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aterh9KLnDq8t70L44rdTLOM01E=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38397%2Ff450f909-1d19-409b-8881-7cae292ed4e2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WlTWSgs-MY3B-_ooBisE9T7SZ8I=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38397%2Ff450f909-1d19-409b-8881-7cae292ed4e2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2lAGNEP","display_title":"Marissa Mayer is giving up a ton of money over Yahoo's data breach","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"gBSEZmap","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"She's still worth hundreds of millions.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Marissa Mayer is giving up a ton of money over Yahoo's data breach"},{"_id":"58ac420928cc365082000471","id":"2017/02/21/yahoo-verizon-deal-data-breaches-cost-350-million-dollars","title":"Yahoo dodges disaster on Verizon deal — but still loses $350 million","title_tag":null,"author":"Jason Abbruzzese","post_date":"2017-02-21T13:35:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:35:02 +0000","formatted_date":"02/21/2017","formatted_shares":"629","sort_key":"1CGb0K","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/21/yahoo-verizon-deal-data-breaches-cost-350-million-dollars/","content":{"plain":"Verizon is still going to buy Yahoo despite the revelation of massive security breaches within the company.\nYahoo isn't getting off scot-free. The new deal will be $350 million lighter than the original, according to a press release issued on Tuesday by Yahoo. In other words, Verizon was able to knock off 7 percent from the original deal price. \nInvestors had clearly been braced for a bigger hit to Yahoo. News that the deal would still go through began to emerge last week, when Bloomberg reported that Verizon had renegotiated $250 million off the deal price.\nThat sent shares in Yahoo sharply higher.\n\nJan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research, noted that the new deal shows that there's little expectation of the data breaches having much of an impact on the company in the future.\n\"The $350 million discount is not actually all that significant, which likely reflects the fact that security breaches like this don’t end up having all that much long-term impact on customer satisfaction or usage,\" he wrote on Tech Narratives. \nVerizon agreed to acquire Yahoo's core business in July 2016 for $4.83 billion, a move that marked the end of Yahoo's long run as one of the premiere independent internet companies. \n\"We continue to be very excited to join forces with Verizon and AOL. This transaction will accelerate Yahoo's operating business especially on mobile, while effectively separating our Asian asset equity stakes,\" Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in a press release. \"It is an important step to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo, and we can now move forward with confidence and certainty. We have a terrific, loyal, experienced team at Yahoo. I'm incredibly proud of our team's strong product and financial execution in 2016, setting the stage for a successful integration.\" \nNot long after, news emerged that Yahoo had been the subject of two separate, massive security breaches that included the theft of account information for 1 billion users.\nThe revelation led to Verizon openly stating that it was looking into whether the revelation of the breaches — which Verizon apparently did not know about at the time of the deal — would affect the value of Yahoo. \nDawson added that he remains skeptical that Verizon will have much success in integrating Yahoo alongside its other digital properties (AOL, namely) in an effort to compete for online advertising.\n\"Ironically, now the big question once again becomes whether Verizon can actually craft something compelling out of these various bits of yesteryear’s Internet. Verizon is said to be aiming to go head to head with Google and Facebook, which is a real stretch when it comes to well-targeted advertising, and I’m still very skeptical that these assets combined can ever be more than a second tier player in the online advertising market,\" Dawson wrote.\nBONUS: This flying motorcycle is straight out of Star Wars"},"shares":{"linked_in":13,"facebook":142,"twitter":459,"google_plus":14,"pinterest":1,"total":629},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rdvzCQe3gP85OX85IaR6crCinYw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F384813%2F0d2dc7e4-1018-410f-92cb-cc67029a1b3d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WUGtc8i9CnQxh0kWw_vwjkgBKbY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36945%2F11b68c12-e1c8-440f-9ff7-10ee8ff2f7ef.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/26B9rdC7X7CDahEb3PCVCt1kbeQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36945%2F11b68c12-e1c8-440f-9ff7-10ee8ff2f7ef.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6Sp-dUlx-k9yhCOGpHDMbGGR-70=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36945%2F11b68c12-e1c8-440f-9ff7-10ee8ff2f7ef.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ktz_NRhXUApv3Sy8BuwQnjM3sCk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36945%2F11b68c12-e1c8-440f-9ff7-10ee8ff2f7ef.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2B369FyWifcjBiW9OFZ6XiEmDqo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36945%2F11b68c12-e1c8-440f-9ff7-10ee8ff2f7ef.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2kHxztK","display_title":"Yahoo dodges disaster on Verizon deal — but still loses $350 million","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"9E2Zt4AM","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Despite the revelations of major data breaches, the deal goes on.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Yahoo dodges disaster on Verizon deal — but still loses $350 million"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":835}

The $186 million is a far bigger number than had been previously revealed in regulatory filings. Mayer's payday could been even bigger if not for a penalty assessed by the company in response to Mayer's handling of Yahoo's massive data breaches.\nThe former Google exec took over the massive but declining tech company in 2012. She proved unable to push Yahoo into the future, with its main business of online display advertising continuing to decline, tempered only slightly by efforts to get more into mobile and video advertising.\n\nMarissa Mayer was #Google's 1st female #engineer & 20th employee when she started there in 1999. pic.twitter.com/qImn5752cp— Susan Dolan (@GoogleExpertUK) April 24, 2017\n\nThat didn't matter much thanks to Yahoo's sizable investment in Alibaba, the massive ecommerce company that went public in 2014. The stake had made Yahoo an appealing way for U.S. investors to invest in Alibaba before its IPO, helping to drive up Yahoo's share price in the mean time. \nThe Alibaba stake also ended up forcing Mayer into a role she didn't necessarily want to inhabit — that of the CEO shopping her company. Investors in Yahoo, eager to avoid tax hits and maximize their return on the Alibaba investment, pushed Mayer to sell Yahoo's core business to another company. \nThat company ended up being Verizon, which is set to buy Yahoo for about $4.5 billion (the original deal was renegotiated and $350 million removed from the price due to the data breaches).  \nMayer reportedly wont be sticking around after the sale, despite having written a blog in which she detailed that she planned to stay. \nTough break. At least there's 186 million parting gifts.\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to clarify that Mayer's stock in Yahoo was accrued as part of her compensation and was not acquired as part of the sale to Verizon.\n\nWATCH: This Star Wars-like flying car is everyone's dream come true"},"shares":{"facebook":132,"pinterest":4,"twitter":305,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":298,"total":746},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zpFmQOm2hP1TILbVKlAceDOAR1s=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F457450%2F52f3d8db-2f7d-4099-ac36-2bea120fba64.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d0jBN6TFkpfSL7ZYG-YTsMCCQu8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/A8VR-ckJWmbAHa8h2S32bT9Peyo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/o-1RLxNKUGvdD3Rg5NMBw0HTelU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e4lDBsCBOnHpCnCM0wXNDpmOidA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vNbNas3F4OFSqiKx9Lb-wt9c9zE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43834%2F585bf1ae-1e40-4b85-8c04-3eb5d5dffec9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2qbaZrY","display_title":"Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is sitting on stock worth $186 million","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"kUZGmtlp","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Best.

But the Yahoo branding you're familiar with will stick around and become part of Verizon.\nLet's unknot this pretzel.\nSEE ALSO: Marissa Mayer is stepping down from Yahoo's board of directors — if the Verizon deal goes through\nNews broke late Monday that once Yahoo is officially acquired by Verizon, the company will change its name to Altaba. That works because the company that remains will be a husk, stripped of its primary assets. \nThink of it this way: Years ago, someone planted a seed and called it \"Yahoo Inc.\" It grew into a big ol' tree with some fruit hanging off of it. Verizon comes along with a basket and says, \"Hey, I want to buy that fruit.\"\nIt can take all that fruit, including a really nice-looking tidbit that is the Yahoo brand, but the tree is still called Yahoo Inc. So, the farmer goes to the, uh, Securities and Exchange Commission (just roll with us) and says, \"Hey, I'm selling all of my fruit to Verizon, and they can bake it into a new pie called Yahoo, but I need to change the name of this tree to Altaba. Cool?\"\nThat's what's meant by Item 8.01 in SEC Form 8-K that Yahoo Inc. filed Monday, a.k.a. the worst bedtime story about trees and fruit you've ever read to your children. \n\"The Board also determined that, following the Closing, it intends to cause the Company’s name to be changed to Altaba Inc.,\" it says.\nSo, the most important bits of Yahoo's brand and operations are slated to become part of Verizon. To make that happen, the stuff that's left behind (basically just a holding company for previously purchased stock in Alibaba) is renamed Altaba, which you'll probably never hear of again.\nGet your jokes out now, in other words.\n\nYahoo is changing its name to  Altaba, which will hopefully throw hackers off the scent for a while.— Mark Milian (@markmilian) January 9, 2017\n\nTronc 2: Altaba Nights— M.G.

Update your Yahoo accounts\nIf you haven't changed your username and password since August 2013 (the time when the hack occurred) it's time to do it immediately. Yahoo is advising all its users to update their credentials and security questions/answers. Both might have been compromised. \n2. Change Yahoo passwords, security questions on other accounts \nIf you used your Yahoo passwords and security questions on multiple services, like social media or banking services, they could have been compromised. You need to urgently change them. This is an opportunity for you to learn to use different passwords on the service you use. \n3. Use a password manager\nPlatforms like LastPass or 1Password can generate and store passwords and security answers for all of the accounts you have. These password managers only require users to have one master password, so they can make your life easier. \nYahoo advises to use Yahoo Account Key, the in-house authentication tool.\n4. Don't trust emails asking for more information\nYahoo advises users to be cautious \"of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information.\"\nSimilarly, users should avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails or unknown email addresses. \n5. Check your bank accounts\nYahoo also encourages users to review the online banking accounts for suspicious activity. \n \"Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information,\" it said. \nHackers who have gained private information might try to open a credit card in your name.\nBONUS: Email-scamming princess asks comedian to marry her"},"shares":{"facebook":994,"twitter":723,"google_plus":26,"total":1743},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oOVNmc7zOPfOKCAOLmW69sflcLY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F319499%2F57841475-32cc-40e6-baea-990aa58b7b21.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9gNOwCN0izUqruSIUiOjHNhSWT4=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30985%2F7831a697-1a9d-40c6-8bdb-5de780c082a4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/goUbMliWF9TKGa7DgpUnv2IWqTo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30985%2F7831a697-1a9d-40c6-8bdb-5de780c082a4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Y6Wk5FGFL6ZEseYxyvwD5JdtzYE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30985%2F7831a697-1a9d-40c6-8bdb-5de780c082a4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KF4hMLnslSNSEZnwZAWBEepHDuQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30985%2F7831a697-1a9d-40c6-8bdb-5de780c082a4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hAChclcm0CBaFKQEHa5AgbsE8Z8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30985%2F7831a697-1a9d-40c6-8bdb-5de780c082a4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hzOA47","display_title":"5 things to do right now if your Yahoo account was hacked","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"D1On8DgnBv","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"More than 1 billion accounts have been compromised.

With the help of forensic experts, the company was able to confirm their authenticity but has yet to identify a corresponding intrusion, Bob Lord, Yahoo's security head, wrote in a post providing security information for users. \nWhile the theft doesn't appear to include credit card or bank account information, Yahoo says names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, MD5-hashed passwords (a form of encryption now widely considered insecure) and security question answers may have been affected.\nYahoo is responding by prompting potentially affected users to change their passwords and invalidating all security questions.

Yahoo says it has taken steps to shut them down.\nThe staggering new revelations come as Yahoo is still in the process of finalizing its $4.8-billion sale to Verizon.

The headphone jack\n\nApple's annual iPhone launch always hits the mobile world like a shiny glass meteor, but the new iPhone 7 had an aftershock that will be felt for years: the removal of the headphone jack. \nDespite being a near-universal standard used in devices worldwide, the eminently functional 3.5mm jack couldn't survive Apple's determination to shape the future -- one where audio is wireless. In the present, however, cords still rule, and Apple's big move has given us all dongles to lose, essentially mainstreaming inconvenience. (It's also forcing grown adults to say the word \"dongle.\") \nWhether you call that courage or hubris, Apple has put a stake in the ground, one other smartphone makers will navigate around, or perhaps trip over, for years to come.  --Pete Pachal\n2. Fake news infects Facebook\n\nNo, Hillary Clinton did not conduct Satanic rituals, but you might have read that if you spent much time on Facebook this year. \nThe spread of fake news emerged as a serious problem during and after the election, as skilled trolls learned they could make gobs of cash by writing up whatever conspiracies would be shared by those parts of the American public that had lost faith in the mainstream media. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claimed it wasn't a problem. Various pieces of data showed otherwise.  --Jason Abbruzzese\n3. The explosive Samsung Galaxy Note7\n\nAfter years of living in Apple's shadow as second best, Samsung was poised to race past the iPhone with the Galaxy Note7. \nThe Note7 had everything going for it -- a beautiful curved glass design, a high-res screen, a huge battery, the best cameras, water resistance, a memory-card slot, a headphone jack, etc. -- until disaster struck. \nShortly after launching to critical acclaim, Note7's started inexplicably exploding, and Samsung issued a global recall. Replacements with \"safe\" batteries were supposed to fix things, but they, too, started catching fire and eventually forced Samsung to discontinue the phone entirely. \nIt's no laughing matter when devices, especially those as personal as smartphones, put users at risk. Samsung's unfortunate nightmare, however, is a lesson every phone maker will hopefully remember: safety should the No. 1 priority, not features.  --Raymond Wong\n4. Self-driving cars rev their engines\n\nThis was the year development of driverless cars shifted into high gear. Tesla pledged to include an enhanced, completely self-driving Autopilot in all models, and Uber was the first ride-sharing company to put driverless cars on the road, starting in Pittsburgh. \nTraditional auto manufacturers got in on the action, too. Audi showed off how advanced its driverless tech was, and GM partnered up with Lyft -- moves that might put Detroit into pole position in the self-driving race. \nBut it wasn't all easy riding: Apple made some noise early with its rumored \"Project Titan,\" but reportedly ran out of gas by the year's end. Google's autonomous program had its first (extremely minor) accident, and a tragic crash killed the driver of a Tesla, reportedly in Autopilot mode. \n2016 was a year of major progress, but a world where self-driving vehicles take over the streets is still a little bit further down the road.  --Brett Williams\n5. Snapchat sets the bar for digital cool \n\nEvan Spiegel showed the world Snapchat was a force to be reckoned with in 2016. \nAs the company made some of its biggest advances -- photo saving (!!!) in Memories, a rebrand (hello, Snap), hardware launch and (rumored) IPO -- Facebook, naturally, panicked. The social network doubled and tripled down on its efforts to push Snapchat aside, cramming filters, animations and disappearing messages into all corners of its apps. \nThe fact that most of these efforts have been met with little more than a yawn and an eye roll (Instagram Stories perhaps being an exception) says less about Facebook and more about the sheer dominance of Snapchat, which has cemented its place as the hippest social app around. \nThe company even made wearables cool with Spectacles -- finally proving tech-laden glasses are for more than just nerds.  --Karissa Bell\n6. Hacking gets even worse\n\nLarge-scale hacks have unfortunately become relatively common in recent years, but 2016 managed to make them even more worrisome. \nVarious organizations (including WikiLeaks) were able to \"weaponize\" email breaches of political candidates with deliberate, precise leaks timed to maximize media coverage. The beleaguered Yahoo squandered whatever trust its users still had when it was revealed the company didn't publicly disclose a large-scale hack from 2014 until months after it found out. \nAnd perhaps worst of all, the emergence of the Mirai botnet exposed the security nightmare that is the Internet of Things, with massive DDoS attacks like the one on Dyn endangering the internet itself. \nIf 2016 is any indication, the future of cybersecurity looks bleak.  --PP\n7. The rise of Facebook Live\n\nFacebook's push into live video streaming was inevitable. Though a little late to the party, Facebook Live has quickly proven to be a hit, not just for serendipitous viral content (hi Chewbacca lady), but as a powerful tool for real-time reporting, capturing everything from sports to insurgencies as they unfold. \nCompared to traditional live broadcasts, Facebook Live provides a more authentic look through a person's eyes, completely unfiltered and unedited, and allows viewers from anywhere in the world to tune in and engage with comments and reactions in a more direct way. \nMeerkat (RIP) and Periscope proved live video could work (and work at scale), and with its \"lives,\" Facebook took things to a new level.  --RW\n8. Hyperloop One melts down\n\nAll companies have their ups and downs -- especially young ones -- but the battles are usually waged against external forces. Hyperloop One, though, bit its own tail. \nIn the space of two months, the nascent company went from a successful and public demonstration of the propulsion tech for its tube-based transportation system to an equally public falling out between founder and CEO Shervin Pishevar and its then CTO and cofounder Brogan BamBrogan. \nThe lawsuit was bizarre by any standard, with BamBrogam claiming that Pishevar's brother had placed a noose on his office chair. By November, the suit was settled, but the damage was done. The company has reorganized, but the promised first in-tube test that was supposed to happen in 2016 is pretty much out of reach. \nTo make the future of technology happen, Hyperloop One needs to show a working Hyperloop pod to race away from 2016 as fast as humanly possible.  --Lance Ulanoff\n9. Apple versus the FBI\n\nArguably the most impactful thing Apple did this year wasn't a product launch -- it was drawing a line in the sand when it comes to iPhone privacy. \nWhen the FBI publicly sued Apple to hack an iPhone owned by a former terrorist, Tim Cook's refusal was swift and clear, declaring any attempt to do so would be akin to opening a \"Pandora's box\" -- the first step towards a future where digital security is illusory. \nIn the end, the FBI backed down -- it apparently found another method for cracking the iPhone in question -- but not before the debate had CEOs, law enforcement, privacy advocates and even presidential candidates taking sides. \nWhile this specific case has faded away, the debate over digital privacy and \"warrant-proof\" data still rages today.  —PP\n10. No one wants to buy Twitter\n\nThanks to President-elect Donald Trump, it seemed like Twitter had perhaps never been so important as during the 2016 election. And yet Twitter as a company had a tumultuous year. \nTwo-time CEO and cofounder Jack Dorsey has only added 10 million active users to the platform since he returned in Oct. 2015, advertisers are becoming more and more disinterested, and top executives, including COO Adam Bain, have left. \nWhile acquisition rumors are commonplace for Twitter, it seemed like it would become a reality with Disney, Google and Salesforce apparently circling. No dice, and that may in part be because of the trolling and harassment that continues to plague the site. \nA silver lining: Twitter inked video deals with major sports leagues NFL, MLB, NHL and NBA, news shows from Bloomberg News and Cheddar, and even the Star Wars franchise. \nMeanwhile, Twitter has cut costs by laying off hundreds of employees and shutting down Vine in hopes of, finally, becoming profitable.  --Kerry Flynn\n11. Facebook becomes a global power\n\nFacebook climbed to impressive and sometimes troubling new heights in 2016. \nIts power to transform how we consume information enabled the spread of propaganda at a pivotal moment in United States history, creating political echo chambers where misinformation thrived. Its solar-powered Aquila drone flew for the first time -- demonstrating a technology that will bring Facebook-controlled internet to remote parts of the world. \nMessenger, Facebook's standalone messaging app, expanded beyond 1 billion users. The company threw its weight behind live video, allowing Facebook's mobile app users to broadcast their lives through their smartphone cameras, and showed its vision for virtual reality. And it debuted artificial intelligence technology that can describe photographs to the blind. \nFacebook can no longer be shrugged off as a frivolous place to share status updates. It is perhaps the single most important distributor of information for its 1.79 billion monthly users.  --Damon Beres\n12. #RIPVine\n\nIf ever there was an app that epitomized the internet's ability to catapult creative teens into overnight celebrities, it was Vine. \nFounded in 2012 and acquired by Twitter soon after, the app for six-second videos was hugely influential, and not just for the superstars it helped create. That's why, when Vine announced in October it would be shutting down the app for good, it sent shockwaves through social media. Even though Vine had lost most of its influential users and much of its cultural capital in recent years, it helped democratize video sharing in a world before Snapchat. \nEveryone from the app's founders to its biggest stars used the #RIPVine hashtag to eulogize the community that once was -- they just didn't do it on Vine. --KB\n13. VR is everywhere and nowhere\n\nThis was supposed to be the year virtual reality took off in a big way, but we have yet to see the viral VR hit that takes the medium mainstream. \nFacebook's Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive and Sony's PlayStation VR all made their official debuts, but it turns out that the content doesn't yet have the impact of the hardware. Meanwhile, Apple and Microsoft are betting on augmented reality, while the mysterious Magic Leap continues to plot and refine its mixed-reality vision in the background. \nNevertheless, VR has the lead right now, and this is just the first chapter in VR's story. 2016 was VR getting its bearings and establishing the ecosystem for future success. That success, however, depends on developers and consumers meeting in the same place -- something that always feels just slightly out of reach.  --Adario Strange\n14. Uber's quiet domination\n\nIn 2016, Uber became more than a ride-sharing company. \nThe $60 billion company made its self-driving cars a reality in Pittsburgh and unveiled a plan to control on-demand air travel, too. The Silicon Valley giant raised an unprecedented $3.5 billion in one funding round on its continued quest for world domination. \nBut it also fought legal battles in London and France, not to mention its ongoing fight in the United States over whether its drivers deserve full worker protections as employees, not contractors. Not to mention, Uber gave up on China almost entirely. \nNext up in 2017: becoming a \"robotics company.\"  --Emma Hinchliffe\n15. The year in acquisitions\n\nBig companies looked to keep getting bigger in 2016, motivated by a still-changing media and tech environment, as well as increasing power among some of the biggest players (Facebook and Google, namely). \nBig moves mean big risks, and each of the year's major deals had plenty of critics. Heck, even Donald Trump weighed in saying AT&T shouldn't be allowed to buy Time Warner.  --JA\n16. Theranos comes tumbling down\n\nA visionary CEO, big-name funders, a sky-high valuation, deals with other major players: Theranos had it all -- except the core technology it boasted would revolutionize blood testing. \nA series of investigative pieces by the Wall Street Journal revealed the healthcare startup was mostly a house of cards. Its \"Edison\" machine, which the company claimed would be able to perform hundreds of tests on just a couple drops of blood, turned out not to work very well. Now, Theranos is the subject of a variety of lawsuits and investigations. \nIt was a stunning fall in just a matter of months for what had been one of the brightest startups around.  --JA"},"shares":{"facebook":1170,"twitter":1510,"pinterest":2,"google_plus":110,"linked_in":868,"total":3660},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jIljtgeAduIMtdxBaKCm-JwknZQ=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F305643%2Funtitled-261.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lsM-Pv_uIFh54As54IJNUE6NKvA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F29759%2Funtitled-261.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6dwFIXqHpwaR1e4UFagVlGd8pII=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F29759%2Funtitled-261.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5ayQM3a81zXe9oLMqTRMLv6kejo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F29759%2Funtitled-261.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Hi8rIo6Wfo83l35CdYXa8O9NXCY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F29759%2Funtitled-261.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8Aj_rj8ojcja8Ocdcjlp5jCb6r4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F29759%2Funtitled-261.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2gB3PM2","display_title":"The 16 biggest tech stories of 2016","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Here are the biggest tech stories of 2016.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"The 16 biggest tech stories of 2016"},{"_id":"57f3a8f028cc3677ce000039","id":"2016/10/04/yahoo-newsroom-app","title":"Yahoo Newsroom app is mobile 'Reddit for the masses'","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2016-10-04T13:04:46+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 13:04:46 +0000","formatted_date":"10/04/2016","formatted_shares":"1.6k","sort_key":"1BRpXu","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/10/04/yahoo-newsroom-app/","content":{"plain":"Yahoo wants its readers to be more connected via its latest mobile app.\nCalled Yahoo Newsroom, the app offers a personalized feed of news stories. Rather than simply having articles ranked by clicks and views and by the company's own editorial curation, the algorithm is influenced by a user's behavior and by what they choose to follow -- not unlike other popular social networks. \n\"I see this as Reddit for the masses,\" Simon Khalaf, Yahoo's senior vice president of publishing products, told Mashable.\"It’s not cultish, and this is the wedge that we believe Snapchat and Instagram has not focused on. It's a very strong community feel.\"\nSEE ALSO: Yahoo dishes the details behind its sale to Verizon in 360-page legal filing\nThe release comes as Yahoo is investigating a hack of at least 500 million user accounts and Verizon is still finalizing its acquisition of the company's core assets. It also follows years of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer recasting Yahoo as a mobile-first business yet struggling to release any influential apps. \nUnlike other social networks, Yahoo Newsroom is dedicated to news. \"There's no social pressure. There's no vanity. It's all about true news. This is not hiding between baby pictures that you just have to like,\" Khalaf said. \n\nYahoo Newsroom has three newsfeeds, Khalaf said. The first \"My Feed\" is the main newsfeed influenced by what you choose to follow. \"Explore\" is categorized by topics. The third is your personal profile that displays what you choose to like and share. \nApp users can choose to follow topics, or what Yahoo Newsroom dubs \"vibes.\" In addition to the dozen categories on the Yahoo homepage, such as finance, tech and politics, the app features hundreds of more niche categories, such as U.S. news, artificial intelligence and Hillary Clinton.\nThe app also encourages users to share their own stories. App users can search through Yahoo's feeds or post their own links. Users can then re-post, comment and like other posts.\nThe vibes do not have any human moderators, yet. To prevent fake news from appearing, Yahoo has several tools in places. \"There are a lot of sources that we actually blacklist, but there's also ranking signals that we use. We call it internally, the gravitas. That's a dimension that we give to the algorithm to reject low gravitas or rank very, very low, stories that don't have what we call gravitas,\" Khalaf said. \n\nYahoo Newsroom isn't a brand new app. It's a redesign of its old Yahoo app, which offered little more than what was already in the mobile web experience. \nThe team behind the project said they've been working on the idea since January as a way to further support its 300 million monthly unique visitors, tens of millions of whom comment and share articles, and to attract a younger audience. \n\"The impetus for adding community-related features and the ability to create posts and start conversations, we really believe is geared toward a younger audience that expects that capability today. They want to participate in the conversation, not just consume it,\" said Dave Bottoms, vice president of product management for global homepages and Yahoo Media Experiences.\nThe team plans to introduce more sharing and commenting features in the future, such as stickers and other \"fun stuff,\" in an effort to lure those in Generation Z, Bottoms said. \nThat may be difficult, but not impossible. \n\"Yahoo's app strategy is pretty clear, be relevant with users in Yahoo's strongest user categories,\" Johnny Won, managing director at tech consultancy Hyperstop, wrote in an email. \"While millennials might not need yet-another-news app and get their news from Twitter amongst bits of vitriol, Yahoo's older audience of homepage and app users are probably going to be enthusiastic about another well designed Yahoo experience.\"\n\n "},"shares":{"twitter":827,"facebook":546,"google_plus":10,"linked_in":201,"total":1584},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pMSE1dqQB4WFRBHOFsGzPE4Cnqs=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F233565%2Fhttps-_2F_2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fuploads_2Fcard_2Fimage_2F156186_2Fd9136bc18047414aa7e63dd6fa68a9a8.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bIJi3rup9aePTxZQHZuJ20UO4Pk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23096%2Fhttps-_2F_2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fuploads_2Fcard_2Fimage_2F156186_2Fd9136bc18047414aa7e63dd6fa68a9a8.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uGoVHrh2TULuUkneFOrJX1v2mF8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23096%2Fhttps-_2F_2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fuploads_2Fcard_2Fimage_2F156186_2Fd9136bc18047414aa7e63dd6fa68a9a8.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ICpPMc-Y8XhENZGq3wmd5C-kQJ8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23096%2Fhttps-_2F_2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fuploads_2Fcard_2Fimage_2F156186_2Fd9136bc18047414aa7e63dd6fa68a9a8.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8gLf0jApKmBT_3MHIADTC5bvMs0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23096%2Fhttps-_2F_2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fuploads_2Fcard_2Fimage_2F156186_2Fd9136bc18047414aa7e63dd6fa68a9a8.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xyfbVC7chniUYK6hyBr10ENTbK8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23096%2Fhttps-_2F_2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fuploads_2Fcard_2Fimage_2F156186_2Fd9136bc18047414aa7e63dd6fa68a9a8.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2dpNyHg","display_title":"Yahoo Newsroom app is mobile 'Reddit for the masses'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Yahoo wants its readers to be more connected via its latest mobile app.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Yahoo Newsroom app is mobile 'Reddit for the masses'"},{"_id":"57e49757f11b2c572f0007d1","id":"2016/09/22/how-to-check-if-your-accounts-were-hacked","title":"How to check if you've been the victim of a breach like the Yahoo hack","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2016-09-23T02:45:40+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 02:45:40 +0000","formatted_date":"09/23/2016","formatted_shares":"4.5k","sort_key":"1BNgSC","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/22/how-to-check-if-your-accounts-were-hacked/","content":{"plain":"In what has already been called the worst hack ever, Yahoo confirmed Thursday that at least 500 million users were affected by a security breach from a state-sponsored actor. \nIf you want to tighten up your security, one of the first steps you should take is checking to see how many of your accounts have already been impacted by a security breach. \nSEE ALSO: If you use any Yahoo services, here's what to do following the massive breach\nWhile the Yahoo hack is the biggest, there have been plenty of other massive data breaches over the years and chances are you've been affected by at least a few of them. It's true that most companies try to alert their users to these breaches as soon as possible, but even they sometimes don't find out about them until months or years after the fact. \nBelow, we look at how to know if your information was exposed in the Yahoo hack, or a security breach like it. \nYahoo\nYahoo says it is emailing owners of affected accounts now, so be sure to keep an eye out for an official email from them. (But beware of any suspicious looking messages, especially ones that prompt you to click on any links.)\n@karissabe @selenalarson yep pic.twitter.com/xMcQn6ZrsU— 🙃 Danny (@abcdannye) September 22, 2016\n\nIn the meantime, even if you haven't gotten an email from them, it's still a good idea to change your password and enable two-factor authentication anyway. \nOther Accounts\nOne of the best ways to check many of your major accounts at once is the website haveibeenpwned, which is run by security researcher Troy Hunt, who tracks data breaches. \n\nEnter the email addresses you regularly use into the site to see which of your accounts may have been affected. The site will tell you when the breach occurred and exactly what information was impacted. \nYou can also sign up for alerts tied to your email address so you can be notified as soon as another breach is detected. \nWhile there could still be other sources of personal information out there, Hunt's website is by far the most comprehensive of its kind, so it's not a bad idea to run your email addresses through it every once in awhile. "},"shares":{"twitter":1688,"facebook":2496,"linked_in":267,"google_plus":39,"pinterest":20,"total":4510},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Iz94AE3_atNjobEd_ww6cPIHVHY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F220616%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VPLEoHnctNMDiONurkjJX6RPMEA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qnvyAC-zRQhYs5HYvZWE5NrAkUI=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1jz8N2Ysa7nItb9Cs5PV9g9iyuA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/frbdr-ARcDYjmm1mihoxxAepjw0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1aq4k6qo-34ZQG06HwnDRnINNw8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2cVkhF7","display_title":"How to check if you've been the victim of a breach like the Yahoo hack","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Have you been hacked?
