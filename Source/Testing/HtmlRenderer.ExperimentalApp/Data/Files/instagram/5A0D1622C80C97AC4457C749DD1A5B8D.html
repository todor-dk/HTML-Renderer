The brand's 2015 SNKRS app added an augmented reality component and Nike committed to selling its sneakers directly on Amazon. Nike and other major brands had been plagued by counterfeiters on Amazon, and Nike's partnership with the e-commerce giant suggested more brands that have resisted the pull of direct sales on Amazon could get on board. \nInstagram, for its part, is still navigating how to support brands without turning the app into an e-commerce site. \nIf Nike gets it right, more brands could follow. \nWATCH: Keep yourself clean virtually anywhere with this portable shower"},"shares":{"linked_in":4716,"twitter":453,"facebook":586,"google_plus":9,"stumble_upon":592,"total":6356},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/drSY42M1gx7GdLQpExli2vthmQE=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528366%2F10e75c9c-d1fe-4d67-9003-c66c1254630a.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yHA1GYHaJ1hyhsO3rtlgL1WbL6I=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1ca1v1Y4zOq_Ud5-0AKTLFgCMD0=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ugGgdMYqU8q5ocBZUqmMN9TsXCE=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tviYDa","display_title":"Nike will sell sneakers directly on Instagram","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"VgobG7Q0NY","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Instagram might be the next place you do your shoe shopping.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Nike will sell sneakers directly on Instagram"},{"_id":"595d13cdf11b2c72ce002f63","id":"2017/07/05/instagram-mocks-travel-bloggers","title":"Instagrammers are staging fake camping pictures, and this account is calling them out","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2017-07-05T16:28:13+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 05 Jul 2017 16:28:13 +0000","formatted_date":"07/05/2017","formatted_shares":"3.7k","sort_key":"1DsP02","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/instagram-mocks-travel-bloggers/","content":{"plain":"Instagram is riddled with literally thousands of spectacular photos of tents in precarious spots in far-flung places.\nThe photos are enough to induce envy even for seasoned travelers, but have any of us ever thought to question whether these perilous campsites were actually slept in? \nSEE ALSO: ‘Selfie decks’ are the hot new trend you’re not invited to\nOne woman is calling BS on travel bloggers one Instagram post at a time through a rather hilarious and aptly-named Instagram account entitled @youdidnotsleepthere.

Now her account has around 36.2K followers, she gets tagged in and sent too many photos, many of which she can't post. \nWhile many people find her posts truly hilarious, she also faced some backlash when she first began posting. \n    Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you'll land in Central Park. #youdidnotsleepthere • photo @ovunno A post shared by @youdidnotsleepthere on May 17, 2017 at 10:26am PDT\n\"I always took down photos if people asked me to, but not without calling them out first,\" she says.\nBut, now photographers reach out to her and ask to be featured. \"Pretty much a guarantee that they won't be.

The pair, who have an infant daughter, are again fighting in public, this time over accusations involving infidelity and betrayal. \nWhile nonconsensual porn is terrible no matter who shares it, Kardashian bears a higher level of responsibility given that he used his fame and social media megaphone to exact revenge. By posting the private images, Kardashian endorsed the practice of shaming a woman for her sexuality.\nHe already owes Chyna an apology for his social media abuse, but the public deserves one too. \n\nSEE ALSO: 4 things you should do when you're the victim of revenge porn\nThe saga began when Kardashian posted a series of explicit images that he appeared to have taken, or Chyna sent to him, on Instagram. When his account was disabled, presumably for violating the platform's terms of service, he turned to Twitter. Within about 30 minutes, Twitter had removed the nude images of Chyna that Kardashian shared, though his account remains active. \n\nWhile Kardashian can still reach his 7.4 million Twitter followers, he may land in jail for the juvenile outburst. Nonconsensual porn or \"revenge porn\" is illegal in California and can be punishable by jail time and a fine, though not all states have similar laws. In California, images or recordings of intimate body parts meant to stay private cannot be distributed with the intent to cause emotional distress, according to the law. If the victim is indeed psychologically harmed, the perpetrator may be guilty of a misdemeanor.\nYou might think that violating the companies' terms of service, doing something potentially illegal, and terrorizing someone you once loved in front of an audience of millions could convince Kardashian to take a deep breath and step back from social media. But his string of text-only tweets documenting Chyna's alleged betrayals suggests he thought only of channelling his rage and disappointment. \n\"But she couldn't remain loyal and cheated and f**ked way too many people and she got caught and now this is all happening and it's sad,\" Kardashian wrote on Twitter. \n.@robkardashian It's not okay to share nude images of someone without their consent, no matter how upset you are with them.— End Revenge Porn (@EndRevengePorn) July 5, 2017\n\nSo in case it wasn't clear already: Don't be like Rob Kardashian. Don't use your heartbreak to justify emotional terror. If you feel manipulated by a partner, think of a more productive way to address that pain than resorting to the age-old misogyny of calling her a slut in the public square. Therapy, anger management -- even a long walk in the woods could help. \nNeither Instagram or Twitter would comment on Kardashian's individual account. \"We want to maintain a safe and supportive environment on Instagram, and we work quickly to remove reported content that violates our community guidelines,\" a spokesperson for Instagram said. \nI will always stand for a woman's right to control images of her own body. Doesn't matter who she is or what she has done in the past. https://t.co/TXIM3wleB5— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nTwo high-profile lawyers who specialize in nonconsensual porn cases both tweeted about Kardashian's posts. Carrie Goldberg, founder of the firm C.A. Goldberg, told People that Kardashian faces an uphill legal battle.\n“This is sort of the classic, quintessential revenge porn,” she said. “Rob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim’s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex.”\nLisa Bloom, of The Bloom Firm, linked to coverage of Kardashian's tweets and wrote, \"Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick.\" \nRevenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick. https://t.co/dkLlVHcUmM— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nBut you shouldn't need lawyers to convince you of why nonconsensual porn is so devastating. There are countless first-person accounts, many from women who won't share their last name on dates, never know what prospective employers will find out about them in a Google search, and who are even stalked and harassed by strangers who saw their picture and personal information on the internet. If such a threat doesn't seem real, just pick up a recent issue of Time, which documented those experiences in horrifying detail. \nDespite the work of victims and advocates to raise awareness of nonconsensual porn, Kardashian's cruel tantrum arguably just gave people in possession of intimate images an excuse to feel satisfied — vindicated, even — in making those pictures public. \nFor that he owes everyone a sincere apology -- at the very least.\nWATCH: This giant kinetic sculpture is actually a shape-shifting human face"},"shares":{"twitter":509,"facebook":2172,"linked_in":58,"google_plus":6,"total":2745},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/r1g4DAR4fKcVD_oSHvUMEKluKPA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5FRy5J5TMN8WCDWwX-lk-ePb26Q=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PB80LGc199UCT8lVcfReK9gEqjE=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/X0iJHYsPz3cR60XbTxLfDEbYr-8=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uLHCPg","display_title":"Rob Kardashian owes Blac Chyna, and all of us, an apology","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOzPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"What Kardashian did is awful.

But, one London restaurant is offering \"foodie Instagram packs\" so diners can up their #foodporn game. \nSEE ALSO: Instagrammers are staging fake camping pictures, and this account is calling them out\nThe free kits contain a portable LED camera light, a multi-device charger, a clip-on wide angle camera lens and a tripod selfie stick for overhead table shots. The kits have been designed to provide Instagrammers with everything they need to capture the perfect Instagram shot. \nDirty Bones has launched the kits at its newly opened location in Soho, London, which has been designed with the \"Instagram universe\" in mind. \n\"People love to share what they’re eating on social media, so we wanted to put together something that made it easier to get that perfect shot regardless of the lighting or time of day,\" a spokesperson for Dirty Bones explained. \n\n\"More and more people are also using Instagram to help them decide where to eat, so as a restaurant group it’s key for us to make sure that people are getting the best possible shots of all our dishes and drinks,\" the spokesperson continued. \nAccording to a Dirty Bones statement, the conceptualisation of the pack stems from \"a recognition of the movement and importance of Instagram in present-day foodie culture\" and a desire to \"enable guests to share Dirty Bones Soho's best qualities without compromising the cost atmosphere and design\". \nIf Instagram could be a source of new business for restaurants, providing kits to make the food look more appealing on Instagram is a shrewd business move. If restaurants can't prevent people from tagging them in Instagram posts, then attempting to improve the quality of those shots might be their only option.\n\"Dirty Bones' menu has also been curated to provide picture-perfect shareable content\"\nBut, the restaurant isn't just providing kits.

If that's the case, there's no need to worry. We've got you covered.\nSEE ALSO: The 'Third Thumb' prosthetic for anyone makes me really want an extra finger\nEach week we round up the most important app news along with some of the coolest new and updated apps to help you stay on top of it all. Here's what caught our eye this week. And if you're looking for more, be sure to take a look at last week's roundup.\nEnlight Photofox\nIntroducing #EnlightPhotofox. Here to amaze you with the #art you'll create on #iPhone. Get now for free: https://t.co/stO6UsD3gg pic.twitter.com/Y7mYRaWzcp— Enlight Photofox (@EnlightPhotofox) July 6, 2017\n\nEveryone wants their photos to be the coolest on the feed. But it's not always easy to get the look you want with the relatively small array of free options provided on each form of social media. Enlight Photofox is a premium photo editing app, and it's free! The brand has taken on the idea of making the app free and including features anyone can purchase within it.\nIf you really want to be serious about your photo editing, you might just want to buck up and shell out. Any subscriber who spends at least $3.99 a month, $19.99 a year, or $39.99 up front will have access to all of Enlight's features. The optional subscription lets you add photoshop-style layers and graphic elements to your photos. \nYou can also dive into the \"Darkroom\", a subscription-only mode with more filters and the ability to change tonal parameters. So give Enlight Photofox a shot if you're trying to become the top dog on the photo feed. \nGoogle Earth\nNew (and fuzzy) on @googleearth: live Alaskan Brown Bear cams from @exploreorg! We can bearly wait to spot one! https://t.co/iVGrcVkozF pic.twitter.com/09HxsvCrnh— Google (@Google) July 5, 2017\n\nGoogle Earth just graced the world with something we didn't know we needed. But now that it's here, we can never go back. This beautiful addition to Google Earth is the live stream of dozens of environments. \nThe app gives you a realtime, up-close look at some of your favorite habitats. You can watch lazy walruses in Alaska or swimming sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. And you can't forget the brown bears of Katmai National Park fishing during the salmon rush.\nWhichever habitat you like best, check it out on Google Earth. Even if you're not a huge animal buff, the natural ebb and flow of these environments running continuously on your screen is quite soothing. \nPokémon Go Anniversary\n\nPokémon Go: The game the world will never forget for making police departments and MTA workers post signs reminding people the world around them still exists IRL. It turned one year old this week. \nTo celebrate, players can wear Ash Ketchum's hat to catch special Pikachus from now until July 24. There are also discount anniversary boxes with raid passes, ultra balls, max revives, and incubators. But that's not all. \nA number of cities will be hosting anniversary events. One in particular is Pokémon Go Fest at Chicago's Grant Park on July 22. There will be new Pokémon that have never appeared in the park before, a new medal to add to your profile page, and -- of course -- three team lounges so you can relax with your fellow Insinct, Mystic, or Valor mates.\nBe sure to check if your city is hosting an event, get out there, and keep collecting!\nElsewhere\n\nEver wanted to feel the thrill of flying a plane, but your lack of a pilot license means you'll never be able to? Airplane Flight Pilot Simulation is a free iOS app that's ready to take you into the sky. \nYou'll have your choice of aircraft designs to zip through the 3D skies, for everything from leisure flights to rescue missions. The realistic flight physics, on-screen controls, and sound effects will really get you into the game. So hop in the cockpit and take off!\n\nPanoramic pictures are fun and easy to create on your smartphone, and they provide a way to capture a huge portion of the space around you. But when you try to post your creations on Instagram, they either appear so small that you can't really see what's in the photo, or part of your cool view ends up getting cut off. \nUnsquared, a free app, is here to take the stress out of posting panoramas. You just choose how many pieces you want your photo to be split into, do some cropping, and post away! It's super easy and it'll make you look like a professional on Instagram.\n\nKeep the world safe from an undead menace by bringing an AC-130 gunship's powerful arsenal to bear on the walking corpses. Building on the successes of the original game, Zombie Gunship Survival, a free app, introduces more hooks -- such as base-building -- to keep you invested in fending off the imminent apocalypse.\n\nFrequent travelers, this one's for you. The free HelloGbye app helps you stay organized before, during, and after your trips. You can schedule travel plans, make changes to your itinerary, keep all your confirmation details in one place, manage budgets for solo and group trips, and take advantage of the app's built-in search features to weed out less popular picks. \nPaying subscribers enjoy additional benefits, including preferred hotel rates, no booking fees, and cash back on hotel stays.\n\nLast but not least is Sticky AI! It's all about selfie stickers purely to add a little bit of fun to your messaging apps. You can use the app to make animated or still stickers. Then save the brightly colored comic or cartoon-style designs to your sticker pack to use in the future. Download Sticky AI and start having a little more fun with your social networks.\nThat's all we've got for this week. But be sure to check back next week for all of your app-related updates.\nWATCH: Someone has reinvented the surfboard, and it can 'fly' on water"},"shares":{"google_plus":19,"linked_in":31,"facebook":145,"twitter":397,"total":592},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uuJlI1wAPji4iD8lKIlqRlK72cs=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528450%2F12f82d18-4cdf-4566-bca2-d337f889f7ad.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mVsQ3sLNrYc0A71wF5_UT1FejB4=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KnBiI0U_qxUImBS1rDlZqPjTZ1Q=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_K1HSHXgswxtpxjW12BwMS8yDgI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yXdtlh-n9M3xaky-CV_kcnFaZiI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3X_VOi5vtFWAOBITnTY7h6XRXak=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tDTL9m","display_title":"This week in apps: 'Pokémon Go' turns one, Google Earth live streams, and photo tricks","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gjnL5DMl2q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Unlimited fun.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"This week in apps: 'Pokémon Go' turns one, Google Earth live streams, and photo tricks"},{"_id":"595fbcaaf11b2c2a2a000a6b","id":"2017/07/07/unicorn-trend-is-dead","title":"The unicorn trend is no longer a rarity. Can we please call time on it?","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2017-07-07T16:53:04+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 16:53:04 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"612","sort_key":"1Dtwv6","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/unicorn-trend-is-dead/","content":{"plain":"A unicorn sighting used to be synonymous with something rare, precious, and seldom-sighted. But, the appropriation of this mythical creature as a trendy emblem to emblazon iPhone cases, water bottles, and tote bags has rendered this symbol an out-of-control behemoth. \nThanks to the unicorn trend, this former rarity is literally everywhere. It's time for the unicorn trend to die once and for all. \nSEE ALSO: Watermelons are the trendy Instagram accessory of summer 2017\nIn the past few months alone we've seen unicorn Easter eggs, unicorn eyeliner, unicorn eyebrows, unicorn macarons, unicorn toast and unicorn lattes. Heck, you can eve get yourself a unicorn dildo if you want to. Certainly all of these things aren't advertising for \"unicorns\" -- startup companies worth more than $1 billion. \nThe straw that broke the unicorn's back was Starbucks' kaleidoscopic monstrosity, the Unicorn Frappuccino. The blue-and-pink concoction, which transitioned from sweet to sour, was a veritable Instagram hit. But, the \"fun\" didn't quite end there. The buzz surrounding the drink gave rise to its own micro-trends. Unicorn Frappuccino-inspired hair art became a real-life thing. And, baristas began making spin-off concoctions like unicorn lemonade. \nAccording to Google Trends, global search interest in unicorn reached its all-time highest point in April 2017, when Unicorn Frappuccinos exploded onto the scene. According to a Google spokesperson, the related searches in April were primarily focused on the Unicorn Frappuccino. \n\nSince peaking in April, search interest has dropped. But, interest is nonetheless still higher than it was at the start of the year. \nEven despite peaking in April, unicorns are still everywhere. Go into any stationery shop or high street clothing store and I guarantee you'll spot something unicorn-related. \n\nUnicorn beauty and food trends continue to take Instagram by storm, with unicorn noodles and unicorn bagels the most recent examples. \nBut, perhaps Gordon Ramsay -- for once -- had a point when he proffered his thoughts on the trend. \"Unicorns are meant for children’s tales, not food. Period,\" Ramsay told PopSugar. Amen to that.\n\"Unicorns are meant for children's tales, not food. Period.\"\nYou can have too much of a good thing. What was once a fun emblem for your gym tee has now morphed into a tired and overused symbol that many of us never want to see ever again.

I did what I thought the best mother would do, which was to give him a life that provided for his specific needs. He'd been with me for nearly four years and I was his mom- I was in the best position to discern what those needs were.

I still support him financially and I'll always be there for him in every way but he's notably happier in his new surroundings.  Why should this story be subject to scrutiny and anger? It is willfully misunderstanding the truth. I hope those judging can imagine the incredible pain of letting go of your favorite creature on EARTH because you know you can't help them be healthy and happy. I would never say an unkind word about the staff of BARC, what they do is amazing and life saving for these animals- but we have different accounts of Lamby's behavior and they were not present in my home nor did they live with him for an extended period. They did not witness the consistent and responsible care I provided.  I have weathered a lot of micro-scandals but this one hurts MOST, because of the vulnerability of letting people know Lamby and my story, and because I miss him so damn much. This is the painting that greets me every day when I walk into my home. This is the animal who taught me about loving and letting go.  I know I'm a lot of fun to place your issues on, but I won't let anyone hang their hat on this peg. Not this time.

Brands can tag their photos with links to products that show up the same way a tag of a friend or another Instagram user would.\nNike has experimented with the ways it reaches buyers lately. The brand's 2015 SNKRS app added an augmented reality component and Nike committed to selling its sneakers directly on Amazon. Nike and other major brands had been plagued by counterfeiters on Amazon, and Nike's partnership with the e-commerce giant suggested more brands that have resisted the pull of direct sales on Amazon could get on board. \nInstagram, for its part, is still navigating how to support brands without turning the app into an e-commerce site. \nIf Nike gets it right, more brands could follow. \nWATCH: Keep yourself clean virtually anywhere with this portable shower"},"shares":{"linked_in":4716,"twitter":453,"facebook":586,"google_plus":9,"stumble_upon":592,"total":6356},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/drSY42M1gx7GdLQpExli2vthmQE=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528366%2F10e75c9c-d1fe-4d67-9003-c66c1254630a.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yHA1GYHaJ1hyhsO3rtlgL1WbL6I=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HZDJSQYAeSAiMRQimLW_ADPxbPw=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UzCwXMRGhu0C5Wv9KWMLRL31cxQ=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0UG1riNK-RtrmK0WEq2pa1daaJ0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E5drALa-yt_HF83l-OkrMW_e3T8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tviYDa","display_title":"Nike will sell sneakers directly on Instagram","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"VgobG7Q0NY","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Instagram might be the next place you do your shoe shopping.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Nike will sell sneakers directly on Instagram"},{"_id":"595d13cdf11b2c72ce002f63","id":"2017/07/05/instagram-mocks-travel-bloggers","title":"Instagrammers are staging fake camping pictures, and this account is calling them out","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2017-07-05T16:28:13+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 05 Jul 2017 16:28:13 +0000","formatted_date":"07/05/2017","formatted_shares":"3.7k","sort_key":"1DsP02","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/instagram-mocks-travel-bloggers/","content":{"plain":"Instagram is riddled with literally thousands of spectacular photos of tents in precarious spots in far-flung places.\nThe photos are enough to induce envy even for seasoned travelers, but have any of us ever thought to question whether these perilous campsites were actually slept in? \nSEE ALSO: ‘Selfie decks’ are the hot new trend you’re not invited to\nOne woman is calling BS on travel bloggers one Instagram post at a time through a rather hilarious and aptly-named Instagram account entitled @youdidnotsleepthere.

Now her account has around 36.2K followers, she gets tagged in and sent too many photos, many of which she can't post. \nWhile many people find her posts truly hilarious, she also faced some backlash when she first began posting. \n    Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you'll land in Central Park. #youdidnotsleepthere • photo @ovunno A post shared by @youdidnotsleepthere on May 17, 2017 at 10:26am PDT\n\"I always took down photos if people asked me to, but not without calling them out first,\" she says.\nBut, now photographers reach out to her and ask to be featured. \"Pretty much a guarantee that they won't be.

The pair, who have an infant daughter, are again fighting in public, this time over accusations involving infidelity and betrayal. \nWhile nonconsensual porn is terrible no matter who shares it, Kardashian bears a higher level of responsibility given that he used his fame and social media megaphone to exact revenge. By posting the private images, Kardashian endorsed the practice of shaming a woman for her sexuality.\nHe already owes Chyna an apology for his social media abuse, but the public deserves one too. \n\nSEE ALSO: 4 things you should do when you're the victim of revenge porn\nThe saga began when Kardashian posted a series of explicit images that he appeared to have taken, or Chyna sent to him, on Instagram. When his account was disabled, presumably for violating the platform's terms of service, he turned to Twitter. Within about 30 minutes, Twitter had removed the nude images of Chyna that Kardashian shared, though his account remains active. \n\nWhile Kardashian can still reach his 7.4 million Twitter followers, he may land in jail for the juvenile outburst. Nonconsensual porn or \"revenge porn\" is illegal in California and can be punishable by jail time and a fine, though not all states have similar laws. In California, images or recordings of intimate body parts meant to stay private cannot be distributed with the intent to cause emotional distress, according to the law. If the victim is indeed psychologically harmed, the perpetrator may be guilty of a misdemeanor.\nYou might think that violating the companies' terms of service, doing something potentially illegal, and terrorizing someone you once loved in front of an audience of millions could convince Kardashian to take a deep breath and step back from social media. But his string of text-only tweets documenting Chyna's alleged betrayals suggests he thought only of channelling his rage and disappointment. \n\"But she couldn't remain loyal and cheated and f**ked way too many people and she got caught and now this is all happening and it's sad,\" Kardashian wrote on Twitter. \n.@robkardashian It's not okay to share nude images of someone without their consent, no matter how upset you are with them.— End Revenge Porn (@EndRevengePorn) July 5, 2017\n\nSo in case it wasn't clear already: Don't be like Rob Kardashian. Don't use your heartbreak to justify emotional terror. If you feel manipulated by a partner, think of a more productive way to address that pain than resorting to the age-old misogyny of calling her a slut in the public square. Therapy, anger management -- even a long walk in the woods could help. \nNeither Instagram or Twitter would comment on Kardashian's individual account. \"We want to maintain a safe and supportive environment on Instagram, and we work quickly to remove reported content that violates our community guidelines,\" a spokesperson for Instagram said. \nI will always stand for a woman's right to control images of her own body. Doesn't matter who she is or what she has done in the past. https://t.co/TXIM3wleB5— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nTwo high-profile lawyers who specialize in nonconsensual porn cases both tweeted about Kardashian's posts. Carrie Goldberg, founder of the firm C.A. Goldberg, told People that Kardashian faces an uphill legal battle.\n“This is sort of the classic, quintessential revenge porn,” she said. “Rob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim’s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex.”\nLisa Bloom, of The Bloom Firm, linked to coverage of Kardashian's tweets and wrote, \"Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick.\" \nRevenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick. https://t.co/dkLlVHcUmM— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nBut you shouldn't need lawyers to convince you of why nonconsensual porn is so devastating. There are countless first-person accounts, many from women who won't share their last name on dates, never know what prospective employers will find out about them in a Google search, and who are even stalked and harassed by strangers who saw their picture and personal information on the internet. If such a threat doesn't seem real, just pick up a recent issue of Time, which documented those experiences in horrifying detail. \nDespite the work of victims and advocates to raise awareness of nonconsensual porn, Kardashian's cruel tantrum arguably just gave people in possession of intimate images an excuse to feel satisfied — vindicated, even — in making those pictures public. \nFor that he owes everyone a sincere apology -- at the very least.\nWATCH: This giant kinetic sculpture is actually a shape-shifting human face"},"shares":{"twitter":509,"facebook":2172,"linked_in":58,"google_plus":6,"total":2745},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/r1g4DAR4fKcVD_oSHvUMEKluKPA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5FRy5J5TMN8WCDWwX-lk-ePb26Q=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xcrg_JcL-Cty3nNlKKQZ68FHMTA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nXTPIhdSWS_2_90LdOM57cS3A8s=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ASm4dWhfq_oMcwvCSP7lTIbstDY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7xHb0bH1js0LxYI6pm0pDr7L74U=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uLHCPg","display_title":"Rob Kardashian owes Blac Chyna, and all of us, an apology","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOzPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"What Kardashian did is awful.

Friends will see your replies, along with a thumbnail image of their original post that you replied to.\n\nLike other messages sent via Direct, the messages won't stick around and friends will be alerted to any screenshots you capture. \nInstagram is billing the new feature as a way to \"be even more fun and playful when you respond to friends,\" but it also stands to be a very good way to drive a  whole lot more people to its less popular Snapchat clone. \nWhile Instagram is constantly boasting about how many of its 700+ million users use Stories (spoiler: it was over 250 million at last count), it's said very little about Direct's disappearing messages, which launched last November (Instagram has said 375 million people use the app's direct messaging though it doesn't break out stats for disappearing messages). \nBut by integrating Direct with Stories, there's a good chance Instagram can change that while doing little else. And should it prove to be even half as bad for Snapchat as Instagram Stories has been for the company, then the change will be much more important than adding a new button to Stories.\n\nWATCH: This mixed reality room is so trippy it might leave you questioning reality"},"shares":{"facebook":336,"google_plus":12,"twitter":524,"linked_in":499,"stumble_upon":135,"total":1506},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jXyS_BQ4OzIT1HIBpDnz0EXzn4k=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527744%2F9183fe61-400e-4b0f-86f9-858e1534499c.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e3dFUOeCezdSvWp5f08WQiV7X24=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YsN93Z4mAaqpIQ8Y5SAiVvu3BSU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bMWmmAwM_04sBBqGFVnekFmNCVE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qr-FCEYAFggrwTuIiQQV-FdOYbE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IZUv3UaLe7WRRwtG8H_1o3e1pAY=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ttRmOE","display_title":"Instagram Stories get a cool feature that Snapchat doesn't have","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5NJnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Instagram Stories are going interactive.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Instagram Stories get a cool feature that Snapchat doesn't have"},{"_id":"595bbd9df11b2c72ce002271","id":"2017/07/04/dad-recreating-daughters-selfies","title":"Dad has been gloriously recreating his daughter's selfies for 15 months now","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-07-04T16:07:42+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 16:07:42 +0000","formatted_date":"07/04/2017","formatted_shares":"1.4k","sort_key":"1DsrYB","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/04/dad-recreating-daughters-selfies/","content":{"plain":"Most dads are embarrassing to some extent, but some dads are so impressively embarrassing they come round full circle and become cool.\nSEE ALSO: Dads having more fun than daughters at Little Mix concert is seriously adorable\nBurr Martin, who last year achieved viral fame after he began recreating his daughter's selfies, is definitely one of those dads.\n    Well, apparently it was a year ago today that all this started.

In a series of new illustrations, Ward has reimagined what classic Disney characters might look like in today's world. \nSEE ALSO: This illustrator is giving '80s movies a gloriously modern twist\n\"I always appreciate visuals that feel familiar but say something new,\" said Ward. \"Disney characters are so iconic that I thought transporting them to our modern world could help us see it through new eyes, giving me an opportunity to communicate some issues I feel strongly about. e.g. circus animals, pollution and the ivory trade, using friendly and familiar visuals with a darker tone.\"\n\nWard came up with the ideas for individual illustrations by imagining the various characters in a 2017 setting.\n\"I asked myself questions like 'What would Simba or Tigger be doing in today's world?' or 'Would people really let a strange boy fly into their bedroom?',\" he explained. \n\"My answers helped me work up ideas for each character. Even magic carpets need a good vacuum now and again. And Pinocchio's nose extending had to be the cultural phenomenon that is the selfie stick.\"\n\nWard admitted he has his favourites from the series.\n\"I like the joy in Gaston and LeFou at gay pride,\" he said. \"This was the most recent idea to take shape following the Beauty and the Beast live action movie release. \n\"I also really enjoy seeing Robin Hood fighting back against the fox hunters.\" \n\nThe one he likes best, though, is a modern twist on The Sword in the Stone.\n\"If I was forced to choose, I think my favourite is the simplicity of Arthur from The Sword in the Stone and the message that he's too engrossed in his phone to realise his true potential in life,\" Ward finished.\n\nYou can follow more of Ward's work on his Instagram, Facebook and Twitter pages.\nWATCH: Here's how the live-action 'Beauty and the Beast' characters compare to the original"},"shares":{"facebook":1929,"twitter":394,"google_plus":6,"linked_in":30,"pinterest":1,"total":2360},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gul05TQoKXpWGuqQOZrr7S2E1ao=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51052%2F9893e452-7230-4690-bb6a-dc575a916ecd.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Fa2C2GwN89wmNVujXYFSF7iJ3qY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51052%2F9893e452-7230-4690-bb6a-dc575a916ecd.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/a3gQ0hsUSB2P2EI7hL_Gloz0Sss=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51052%2F9893e452-7230-4690-bb6a-dc575a916ecd.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sepwD-FDV4VEkXya_hUSSeUHhzY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51052%2F9893e452-7230-4690-bb6a-dc575a916ecd.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5VVIzb3TVI_op4SfiARMSm0ooRU=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51052%2F9893e452-7230-4690-bb6a-dc575a916ecd.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O-naoHPz5lRyTgzcia6MdlEqIhg=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51052%2F9893e452-7230-4690-bb6a-dc575a916ecd.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sOOfzM","display_title":"Illustrator beautifully reimagines what classic Disney movies would be like in 2017","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"LA6nGG3nNv","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Selfie sticks, iPhones, and CCTV.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/culture/","tweet_text":"Illustrator beautifully reimagines what classic Disney movies would be like in 2017"},{"_id":"5964bab528cc360acf000604","id":"2017/07/11/instagram-kits-dirty-bones","title":"Restaurant brings in Instagram kits so you can nail your #foodporn shots","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2017-07-11T11:45:48+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 11:45:48 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"1.4k","sort_key":"1DuTVD","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/instagram-kits-dirty-bones/","content":{"plain":"Making your avocado toast pop on Instagram requires a unique formula that isn't always possible to achieve. But, one London restaurant is offering \"foodie Instagram packs\" so diners can up their #foodporn game. \nSEE ALSO: Instagrammers are staging fake camping pictures, and this account is calling them out\nThe free kits contain a portable LED camera light, a multi-device charger, a clip-on wide angle camera lens and a tripod selfie stick for overhead table shots. The kits have been designed to provide Instagrammers with everything they need to capture the perfect Instagram shot. \nDirty Bones has launched the kits at its newly opened location in Soho, London, which has been designed with the \"Instagram universe\" in mind. \n\"People love to share what they’re eating on social media, so we wanted to put together something that made it easier to get that perfect shot regardless of the lighting or time of day,\" a spokesperson for Dirty Bones explained. \n\n\"More and more people are also using Instagram to help them decide where to eat, so as a restaurant group it’s key for us to make sure that people are getting the best possible shots of all our dishes and drinks,\" the spokesperson continued. \nAccording to a Dirty Bones statement, the conceptualisation of the pack stems from \"a recognition of the movement and importance of Instagram in present-day foodie culture\" and a desire to \"enable guests to share Dirty Bones Soho's best qualities without compromising the cost atmosphere and design\". \nIf Instagram could be a source of new business for restaurants, providing kits to make the food look more appealing on Instagram is a shrewd business move. If restaurants can't prevent people from tagging them in Instagram posts, then attempting to improve the quality of those shots might be their only option.\n\"Dirty Bones' menu has also been curated to provide picture-perfect shareable content\"\nBut, the restaurant isn't just providing kits.

But soon, you may be able to buy them on Instagram too.\nNike plans to \"seamlessly\" offer its sneakers to customers on Instagram, the company said this week. \nSEE ALSO: The unique thrill of vintage shopping on Instagram\nRight now, details are unclear of exactly how Nike will use the app to sell shoes, but the new commitment positions the sneaker brand as one of the first major companies to invest its resources in Instagram as a way to sell products directly to consumers. \nMost other brands have only experimented with shoppable tags since Instagram introduced the e-commerce feature in November. Brands can tag their photos with links to products that show up the same way a tag of a friend or another Instagram user would.\nNike has experimented with the ways it reaches buyers lately. The brand's 2015 SNKRS app added an augmented reality component and Nike committed to selling its sneakers directly on Amazon. Nike and other major brands had been plagued by counterfeiters on Amazon, and Nike's partnership with the e-commerce giant suggested more brands that have resisted the pull of direct sales on Amazon could get on board. \nInstagram, for its part, is still navigating how to support brands without turning the app into an e-commerce site. \nIf Nike gets it right, more brands could follow. \nWATCH: Keep yourself clean virtually anywhere with this portable shower"},"shares":{"linked_in":4716,"twitter":453,"facebook":586,"google_plus":9,"stumble_upon":592,"total":6356},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/drSY42M1gx7GdLQpExli2vthmQE=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528366%2F10e75c9c-d1fe-4d67-9003-c66c1254630a.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yHA1GYHaJ1hyhsO3rtlgL1WbL6I=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HZDJSQYAeSAiMRQimLW_ADPxbPw=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UzCwXMRGhu0C5Wv9KWMLRL31cxQ=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0UG1riNK-RtrmK0WEq2pa1daaJ0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E5drALa-yt_HF83l-OkrMW_e3T8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50699%2F6153d108-f62b-46f6-ad62-0f6b6577b900.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tviYDa","display_title":"Nike will sell sneakers directly on Instagram","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"VgobG7Q0NY","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Instagram might be the next place you do your shoe shopping.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Nike will sell sneakers directly on Instagram"},{"_id":"595e5071f11b2c0dab000e68","id":"2017/07/06/instagram-photo-replies-to-stories","title":"Instagram Stories get a cool feature that Snapchat doesn't have","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2017-07-06T15:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"1.5k","sort_key":"1Dt8Om","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/06/instagram-photo-replies-to-stories/","content":{"plain":"Instagram really wants you to use its Snapchat clone. \nNot Stories, but its other Snapchat clone: Direct (that's the name for Instagram's disappearing messages, for those keeping track). Now, in an effort to push more users to the feature, Instagram is plugging Direct's disappearing photo and video messaging right into Stories.\nSEE ALSO: Instagram is still clobbering Snapchat, and it's worse than we thought\nBeginning now, Instagram will allow you to respond to posts in Stories with disappearing photo and video messages. Those messages, which can -- of course --  be decorated with animated face filters or sent as looping Boomerang videos, will appear in your inbox.\nTap the new camera icon next to the text reply box when watching a Story to send a photo or video reply. Friends will see your replies, along with a thumbnail image of their original post that you replied to.\n\nLike other messages sent via Direct, the messages won't stick around and friends will be alerted to any screenshots you capture. \nInstagram is billing the new feature as a way to \"be even more fun and playful when you respond to friends,\" but it also stands to be a very good way to drive a  whole lot more people to its less popular Snapchat clone. \nWhile Instagram is constantly boasting about how many of its 700+ million users use Stories (spoiler: it was over 250 million at last count), it's said very little about Direct's disappearing messages, which launched last November (Instagram has said 375 million people use the app's direct messaging though it doesn't break out stats for disappearing messages). \nBut by integrating Direct with Stories, there's a good chance Instagram can change that while doing little else. And should it prove to be even half as bad for Snapchat as Instagram Stories has been for the company, then the change will be much more important than adding a new button to Stories.\n\nWATCH: This mixed reality room is so trippy it might leave you questioning reality"},"shares":{"facebook":336,"google_plus":12,"twitter":524,"linked_in":499,"stumble_upon":135,"total":1506},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jXyS_BQ4OzIT1HIBpDnz0EXzn4k=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527744%2F9183fe61-400e-4b0f-86f9-858e1534499c.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e3dFUOeCezdSvWp5f08WQiV7X24=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YsN93Z4mAaqpIQ8Y5SAiVvu3BSU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bMWmmAwM_04sBBqGFVnekFmNCVE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qr-FCEYAFggrwTuIiQQV-FdOYbE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IZUv3UaLe7WRRwtG8H_1o3e1pAY=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50629%2Ffdb49be4-4b19-468c-8d5d-3506adf8fe7e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ttRmOE","display_title":"Instagram Stories get a cool feature that Snapchat doesn't have","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5NJnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Instagram Stories are going interactive.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Instagram Stories get a cool feature that Snapchat doesn't have"},{"_id":"595d7f2528cc362996000103","id":"2017/07/05/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-revenge-porn","title":"Rob Kardashian owes Blac Chyna, and all of us, an apology","title_tag":null,"author":"Rebecca Ruiz","post_date":"2017-07-06T00:06:03+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:06:03 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"2.7k","sort_key":"1DsUM1","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-revenge-porn/","content":{"plain":"{\"player\":{\"description\":\"What Kardashian did is awful.

The pair, who have an infant daughter, are again fighting in public, this time over accusations involving infidelity and betrayal. \nWhile nonconsensual porn is terrible no matter who shares it, Kardashian bears a higher level of responsibility given that he used his fame and social media megaphone to exact revenge. By posting the private images, Kardashian endorsed the practice of shaming a woman for her sexuality.\nHe already owes Chyna an apology for his social media abuse, but the public deserves one too. \n\nSEE ALSO: 4 things you should do when you're the victim of revenge porn\nThe saga began when Kardashian posted a series of explicit images that he appeared to have taken, or Chyna sent to him, on Instagram. When his account was disabled, presumably for violating the platform's terms of service, he turned to Twitter. Within about 30 minutes, Twitter had removed the nude images of Chyna that Kardashian shared, though his account remains active. \n\nWhile Kardashian can still reach his 7.4 million Twitter followers, he may land in jail for the juvenile outburst. Nonconsensual porn or \"revenge porn\" is illegal in California and can be punishable by jail time and a fine, though not all states have similar laws. In California, images or recordings of intimate body parts meant to stay private cannot be distributed with the intent to cause emotional distress, according to the law. If the victim is indeed psychologically harmed, the perpetrator may be guilty of a misdemeanor.\nYou might think that violating the companies' terms of service, doing something potentially illegal, and terrorizing someone you once loved in front of an audience of millions could convince Kardashian to take a deep breath and step back from social media. But his string of text-only tweets documenting Chyna's alleged betrayals suggests he thought only of channelling his rage and disappointment. \n\"But she couldn't remain loyal and cheated and f**ked way too many people and she got caught and now this is all happening and it's sad,\" Kardashian wrote on Twitter. \n.@robkardashian It's not okay to share nude images of someone without their consent, no matter how upset you are with them.— End Revenge Porn (@EndRevengePorn) July 5, 2017\n\nSo in case it wasn't clear already: Don't be like Rob Kardashian. Don't use your heartbreak to justify emotional terror. If you feel manipulated by a partner, think of a more productive way to address that pain than resorting to the age-old misogyny of calling her a slut in the public square. Therapy, anger management -- even a long walk in the woods could help. \nNeither Instagram or Twitter would comment on Kardashian's individual account. \"We want to maintain a safe and supportive environment on Instagram, and we work quickly to remove reported content that violates our community guidelines,\" a spokesperson for Instagram said. \nI will always stand for a woman's right to control images of her own body. Doesn't matter who she is or what she has done in the past. https://t.co/TXIM3wleB5— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nTwo high-profile lawyers who specialize in nonconsensual porn cases both tweeted about Kardashian's posts. Carrie Goldberg, founder of the firm C.A. Goldberg, told People that Kardashian faces an uphill legal battle.\n“This is sort of the classic, quintessential revenge porn,” she said. “Rob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim’s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex.”\nLisa Bloom, of The Bloom Firm, linked to coverage of Kardashian's tweets and wrote, \"Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick.\" \nRevenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick. https://t.co/dkLlVHcUmM— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nBut you shouldn't need lawyers to convince you of why nonconsensual porn is so devastating. There are countless first-person accounts, many from women who won't share their last name on dates, never know what prospective employers will find out about them in a Google search, and who are even stalked and harassed by strangers who saw their picture and personal information on the internet. If such a threat doesn't seem real, just pick up a recent issue of Time, which documented those experiences in horrifying detail. \nDespite the work of victims and advocates to raise awareness of nonconsensual porn, Kardashian's cruel tantrum arguably just gave people in possession of intimate images an excuse to feel satisfied — vindicated, even — in making those pictures public. \nFor that he owes everyone a sincere apology -- at the very least.\nWATCH: This giant kinetic sculpture is actually a shape-shifting human face"},"shares":{"twitter":509,"facebook":2172,"linked_in":58,"google_plus":6,"total":2745},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/r1g4DAR4fKcVD_oSHvUMEKluKPA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5FRy5J5TMN8WCDWwX-lk-ePb26Q=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xcrg_JcL-Cty3nNlKKQZ68FHMTA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nXTPIhdSWS_2_90LdOM57cS3A8s=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ASm4dWhfq_oMcwvCSP7lTIbstDY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7xHb0bH1js0LxYI6pm0pDr7L74U=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uLHCPg","display_title":"Rob Kardashian owes Blac Chyna, and all of us, an apology","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOzPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"What Kardashian did is awful.

Let's be real: the likelihood of anyone actually sleeping on a terrifying precipice is pretty slim. \n  A post shared by @youdidnotsleepthere on Jun 22, 2017 at 10:39am PDT\nLuisa Jeffery from Portland, Oregon, started the account after a 21-day trip in the Grand Canyon. She said a friend on the trip suggested they set up a poler tent in a few crazy locations \"just for the photos\". \nShe says she'd never realised that was \"a thing\" until then. She says she's a huge fan of the @youdidnoteatthat and @youdidnotskatethat accounts and used them as inspiration to start hers. \n    ✌🏽to all the followers who can't get real.

Now her account has around 36.2K followers, she gets tagged in and sent too many photos, many of which she can't post. \nWhile many people find her posts truly hilarious, she also faced some backlash when she first began posting. \n    Shoot for the moon cause if you miss you'll land in Central Park. #youdidnotsleepthere • photo @ovunno A post shared by @youdidnotsleepthere on May 17, 2017 at 10:26am PDT\n\"I always took down photos if people asked me to, but not without calling them out first,\" she says.\nBut, now photographers reach out to her and ask to be featured. \"Pretty much a guarantee that they won't be. Some have asked me not to post photos. A request I respect,\" she says. \n    We must protect our planet, @realdonaldtrump + @epagov. The people of this world need their sleep. #keepparis #fuckpruitt #youdidnotsleepthere • photo  @alfaeventyreren A post shared by @youdidnotsleepthere on Jun 1, 2017 at 12:21pm PDT\nUltimately though, Jeffery feels that the majority of photos posted by travel bloggers on Instagram are staged. \n\"I wouldn't have started the account if I didn't feel like the whole thing was a joke,\" she says. \"There is just such a lack of transparency and honesty about people's lives on Instagram.
