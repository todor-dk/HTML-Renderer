Many of the brands that were once experimenting with Snapchat, such as Everlane and Cole Haan, are now scaling back usage or ceasing efforts on the platform entirely. \"With Instagram replicating most of Snapchat’s capabilities, there's no reason for fashion and beauty brands to maintain an actual account on [Snapchat] anymore,\" said Kitty Tsang, a digital strategist at the agency Ready Set Rocket, in an interview with Glossy.&nbsp;{<a href=\"http://www.glossy.co/platform-effect/should-fashion-bother-with-snapchat-in-a-post-stories-world\">Glossy<\/a>}<\/p><p><strong>Under Armour realigns its strategy by bringing in new leadership<br tml-linebreak=\"true\"><\/strong><a href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/under-armour\">Under Armour<\/a> founder, chairman and chief executive officer Kevin Plank named Patrik Frisk the new president and chief operating officer for the company on Tuesday. Frisk served most recently as CEO of Aldo Group. Though Under Armour's annual sales near $5 billion, it's struggled to keep up with more established competitors like Nike and Adidas in recent years. Through the addition of Frisk and several other management changes, the company is hoping to streamline and refocus its efforts as a major presence in the apparel and footwear retail industry. {<em><a href=\"http://wwd.com/fashion-news/activewear/under-armour-realigns-kevin-plank-patrik-frisk-president-10932631/\">WWD<\/a><\/em>}<\/p><p><strong>Azzedine Alaïa to hold his first couture show in six years next month<\/strong><br tml-linebreak=\"true\">Azzedine&nbsp;Alaïa is set to make a return to the Paris Couture Week calendar on July 5, marking his first couture show in six years.

The <a href=\"https://fashionista.com/2017/04/ftc-influencer-guidelines-sponsored\">Federal Trade Commission<\/a> has increasingly cracked down on undisclosed or misleading #SponCon, mandating that all paid posts must clearly be marked with #Ad or #Sponsored to prevent any confusion on the part of the consumer.<\/p><p>While influencers continue to come up with creative workarounds — iterations involving #partner are a current favorite — <a href=\"https://business.instagram.com/blog/tagging-and-insights/\">Instagram is stepping in<\/a> with a new feature to make disclosure just a little bit easier. Over the coming weeks, the social media company will roll out its new \"Paid partnership with\" tags, which will appear where the Location tag sits on Instagram feeds. The feature will also be available to use on Instagram Stories. Beyond just making full disclosure easier for all parties, Instagram will also be offering insights around those paid posts, allowing brands and influencers to track performance.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci020d3ffb700027b2\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Instagram's new &quot;Paid partnership with&quot; feature in Song of Style's Instagram story.

Of course, the \"Paid partnership with\" tag doesn't fall within those FTC guidelines of #Sponsored or #Ad, so it remains to be seen if the new feature will satisfy critics. In the blog post announcing the feature, Instagram promises it will be \"launching an official policy and enforcement for creators\" in the coming months.<\/p><p><em><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\">Want the latest fashion industry news first?

I hobbled along the rest of the course while a pain climbed up my thigh before tucking itself in deep into my hip, where it stayed for weeks. By the homestretch, I was in tears. My time was blown, and I knew something in my body was, too. <\/p><p>In the months leading up to that race, I was doing everything right, or so I thought. I ate pasta, boxes of it. I got massages. I practiced visualization. I took goddamn ice baths. But what hurt the most was that I put in the work and I still got injured. <\/p><p>When my knee only worsened, I did something I should've done half a year prior: I made an appointment to see a physical therapist. She spent four months getting me back on my feet and helping me heal and understand what I (unknowingly) omitted from my training. <\/p><p>The gist of my IT band injury, I learned, was that I did too much and at once, not enough. I over-exercised, and my body was under great duress because of it. It's a common concern among recreational athletes, many of whom don't know from where to source their instruction, some of which needs to be quite nuanced. And often, we can't help but turn to Instagram, which now offers up a seemingly endless feed of fitness content from influencers who have racked up followings the size of the population of Hong Kong. <\/p><p>This proliferation of exercise is patently a good thing, especially here in the U.S. But it starts to get murky when Instagram, which has already developed a reputation for glossy inauthenticity, can perpetuate a fitness ideal that isn't exactly comprehensive. <\/p><p>\"I think the majority of my patients, the healthy ones, are in their minds doing the right thing,\" says Amanda Scheer, the physical therapist with whom I worked after my injury. She describes me pointedly and perfectly.<\/p><p>\"They're going to the gym every day,\" says Scheer. \"They're signing up for races and they're training. But there's always something that gets forgotten.\"<\/p><p>At press time, the five powerhouse athletic brands&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nikewomen/\">Nike<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adidaswomen/?hl=en\">Adidas<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/underarmourwomen/?hl=en\">Under Armour<\/a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pumawomen/\">Puma<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reebokwomen/\">Reebok<\/a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;had a collective 10.4 million followers across their women-specific Instagram accounts. These feeds don't make mention of physical therapy, and from a purely business perspective, why should they? They're on Instagram to market their products to women like me, not to tell me see a physician before attempting any form of exercise. <a href=\"https://fashionista.com/2017/05/fitness-influencers-workout-instagram-marketing\">Fitness influencers<\/a>, or fitfluencers, can be more forthcoming, but for some, their aspirational bottom line is still the same.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;><div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;><\/div><\/div><p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BQwKdjIACXY/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>A post shared by Nicole Loher (@nicoleloher)<\/a> on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-02-20T23:53:31+00:00&quot;>Feb 20, 2017 at 3:53pm PST<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p>Lisa Moskovitz, a registered dietician and the CEO and founder of The NY Nutrition Group, tells me that many of her clients&nbsp;initially&nbsp;come to her confused by what they're seeing on social media, whether \"they should be doing this plan or this plan.\" Take, for instance, Kayla Itsines's Bikini Body Guide, or BBG. Itsines's PDF guides cost $52 and can be reinforced by a $20-per-month Sweat With Kayla app, and then there's her own pervasive Instagram presence. With 7 million followers and 5,300 posts, the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kayla_itsines/\">@kayla_itsines<\/a> handle serves as a homebase for her \"Kayla's Army,\" some of whom have even been featured on Itsines's feed with a composite of themselves before and after using her program.<\/p><p>\"I think people easily buy into things they see and results they're seeing from this diet shake or this exercise program,\" says Moskovitz. \"But they're forgetting all the wonderful technology that allows us to Photoshop and edit and do this and that.\"<\/p><p>A vast majority of fitfluencers&nbsp;are training at a near-professional level and supplement their workouts with the appropriate activities. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nicoleloher/\">Nicole Loher<\/a>, who works as a creative strategist for Small Girls PR by day, competed in her first triathlon in April 2016 and finished fourth in her age group. She's been hooked ever since. You know this, of course, if you're one of the 14,000 users who follow her on Instagram, where you can find her discussing the ins and outs of her training in extensive detail.<\/p><p>As a triathlete, she trains in three different mediums to reflect the three stages of the race. She also has a support group whom she jokingly calls her \"people,\" including a nutritionist, a swim coach and a physical therapist. In the case of the latter, she goes purely for tune-ups, about once a week, \"just to make sure my body's moving the way it should be.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>Loher's approach to physical therapy is incredibly healthy and one Scheer condones for her own patients. Other full-time fitness experts, like Lauren Ashley Duhamel (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lifeoflaurenashley/\">@lifeoflaurenashley<\/a>)&nbsp;—&nbsp;who teaches&nbsp;Legs by Lauren at Studio B in New York City, with her workouts available on the Fitner app&nbsp;—&nbsp;rely on more high-tech practices for their recovery. Duhamel likes to put in 45 minutes a week at <a href=\"http://www.higherdose.com/\">Higher Dose<\/a>, a hip, fashion crowd-beloved infrared sauna in New York City's East Village.<\/p><p>\"When I leave I really do feel uplifted,\" says Duhamel. \"I feel lighter. I feel like it's very good for anti-inflammation, healing your muscles.\" Cryotherapy, which involves momentarily submerging yourself in a machine that emits nitrogen-iced air at sub-zero temperatures, is also popular. <\/p><p>But Duhamel's favorite method of recovery comes via the <a href=\"https://theragun.com/\">TheraGun<\/a>, a handheld, battery-operated&nbsp;—&nbsp;and at $599, very expensive&nbsp;—&nbsp;\"muscle management device\" that the members-only fitness studio to which she belongs, S10 Training, carries.&nbsp;For the purposes of releasing muscle tension, the TheraGun is highly effective, but nothing does the job better than rest. That's something Scheer likes to stress to patients, many of whom see her for reasons similar to mine.<\/p><p>\"I think too much of a good thing is never a good thing. If you're only doing one activity and you're not addressing the fact that you've used your muscles so intensely by strengthening and stretching, you can't perform optimally,\" says Scheer. \"Sometimes it takes injury to realize that you've done too much in one direction and not enough of the auxiliary things to help out.\"<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexsilverfagan/\">Alex Silver-Fagan<\/a>, a fitness professional and official Nike coach represented by <a href=\"https://fashionista.com/tag/wilhelmina\">Wilhelmina<\/a>, recently adjusted her personal training schedule to take one day off throughout the week. She explains that she used to stack her schedule with everything from lifting to hot yoga throughout the day, but that came at a price. \"I never felt good, and my body was never responding. I was bloated and just plain stressed, and I was holding on to body fat,\" she says. <\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;><div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:45.092592592592595% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;><\/div><\/div><p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BLUN5pcBMED/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>A post shared by Alex Silver-Fagan (@alexsilverfagan)<\/a> on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-10-08T20:47:51+00:00&quot;>Oct 8, 2016 at 1:47pm PDT<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p>Since working some breaks into her routine, Silver-Fagan has found that her body actually responds better to her training; she gets leaner and feels healthier. \"A lot of people think they need to do two or three classes a day and not give themselves a break when our bodies are not meant for that,\" she says. <\/p><p>To call Silver-Fagan's newfound prioritization on rest \"beneficial\" would be an understatement, and speaking to her, it's certainly tempting to calibrate my own schedule to match hers. But to do so blindly would not only be unwise, but could also be, at worst, precarious. That's precisely the issue we're seeing on Instagram.<\/p><p>\"It's very superficial, looking at pictures of people and looking at what they are on the outside and just drawing conclusions and making assumptions, just from the way they appear,\" says Moskovitz. \"It's definitely dangerous.\"<\/p><p>During my own therapy, Scheer would often remind me that everyone's body is wired differently. Some of us break very quickly, and some of us, she says, hold up for years.<\/p><p>\"It's really easy for people to fall into the trap of posting their workouts on Twitter and putting pictures of their Garmins on Instagram,\" says Scheer. \"People see that and feed into it and develop this competitive nature where [instead] we should be exercising for ourselves and to be healthy and well-rounded.\"<\/p><p>But what happens when competition is the very backbone of class-based exercise, which already dominates the fitness landscape in major cities ranging from Los Angeles to Minneapolis? Take <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/flywheelsports/\">Flywheel<\/a>, which offers riders the ability to put their \"torque,\" or a measure of acceleration and power, on a leaderboard visible to the whole class. <\/p><p>Chinae Alexander, also known as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/CHINAEALEXANDER/\">@ChinaeAlexander<\/a>, speaks to this. \"I'm still not a huge class person. In the current environment, people really feel like they have to be paying X-number of dollars to get their six workouts in a week\" she says. \"I feel like there's so much pressure to live up to these sexy standards that have come about with wellness. It makes it really hard for people to do that long-term.\"<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;><div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;><\/div><\/div><p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BToiAE9hqhm/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>A post shared by Lauren Ashley Duhamel (@lifeoflaurenashley)<\/a> on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-05-03T14:19:28+00:00&quot;>May 3, 2017 at 7:19am PDT<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p>This can create a cyclical pattern that can be detrimental to your own progress. Scheer explains that a lot of people will \"go really intensely for three weeks\" before realizing it's just not sustainable and don't work out for another three weeks due to burn out.<\/p><p>Sustainability is a concern for Alexander, too, if only because she wants her followers to find a fitness routine that's reasonable for both their bodies. She notes that this latest iteration of the wellness trend creates \"a lot of pressure and a lot of guilt and a lot of expectation,\" and that's something with which she's trying to help.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\"There are too many things in life that we have to do,\" says Alexander. \"You should enjoy what you're doing, whether it be running, walking, spinning or going to class&nbsp;— there should be some level of enjoyment out of it, even if it is just the satisfaction when you finish.\"<\/p><p>Loher reminds me that she's posting as an athlete, not as a fitness influencer, and that differentiation extends to aspects of her life that aren't traditionally shown on social media, including nutrition.&nbsp;Because she's working out anywhere from two to three hours a day, her body will burn \"way more calories than the average human,\" even when she's resting. She's now eating a surplus of 3,000 calories a day, per a plan developed with her nutritionist.<\/p><p>But many followers aren't seeing the full picture, says Loher, and that's a serious concern for her and others in her position. \"I experienced this when I was on Tumblr, as well, which is why I got off Tumblr,\" she says. \"There are just so many young, impressionable females and males out there and it leads to eating disorders. It's so awful. Transparency for all influencers is very, very important.\"<\/p><p>For <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hannahbronfman/\">Hannah Bronfman<\/a>, founder of <a href=\"http://hbfit.com/\">HBFIT<\/a> and a global ambassador for Adidas, this issue is personal. She tells me in a phone call that the reason she even began her \"healthy journey\" is because her grandmother passed away from anorexia when her body could no longer support her. <\/p><p>\"For me, it was really important to live my happiest and healthiest version of myself. I see a lot of people on Instagram who are, for a lack of a better term, orthorexic, or workoutaholics, and they're trying to get in five classes a day,\" she says. \"Being an extremist in any shape of this, and in any shape of anything in any industry, is dangerous.\"<\/p><p>Eating disorders have long been associated with athletics, regardless of level, especially in organized sports that emphasize appearance. In a study of Division 1 NCAA athletes, over one-third of female athletes \"reported attitudes and symptoms placing them at risk for anorexia,\" according to the <a href=\"https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/athletes-and-eating-disorders\">National Eating Disorders Association<\/a>. Tack on the preexisting cultural emphasis on thinness, and the risks are amplified.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;><div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.12962962962963% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;><\/div><\/div><p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BRBUMn7Au_C/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>A post shared by Hannah Bronfman (@hannahbronfman)<\/a> on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-02-27T15:45:40+00:00&quot;>Feb 27, 2017 at 7:45am PST<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote>\n<script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p>Nutrition is an important subject to broach. Loher lost her period while training for her first triathlon and has since conducted tests with her nutritionist to determine that a ketogenic diet — which is similar to other strict low-carb programs — works best to keep her healthy and safe. \"I'm literally a well-oiled machine when I'm eating keto,\" she tells me.<\/p><p>It's not feasible for everyone to see a nutritionist, or a physical therapist, or a personal trainer. But with the concerns now growing with fitness Instagram, where does the responsibility fall? <\/p><p>When I bring this up with Bronfman, she notes that this wasn't Instagram's role in the beginning. \"I was on this journey before Instagram came out, so when it did come out, I used it as a tool to showcase that journey,\" she says. \"It was really interesting to me to see how much it picked up. When I was growing in the beginning I was like, 'Wow, people are really responding to this content!' And for me, it's not so hard to produce because it's just what I'm up to.\"<\/p><p>However, Alexander sees that the tides are changing; in her own growth, followers are hungry for more authentic content. \"They really want it to be like real life again,\" she says. \"People are looking for real interaction, real words, real photos. I can only hope that wellness does the same thing.\" She suggests that part of that onus falls on the athlete to share a bigger story about how they're living beyond the gym. \"We don't share all of it,\" she says. \"You can't just share the highlight reel.\"<\/p><p>And athletes, by and large, are aware of this. When Loher encountered an ankle injury this spring and was off cardio for two weeks, she discusses that it took her a while to make a mention of it on her Stories. \"But I felt like it would irresponsible for me to be perpetuating something, this greater existence of people thinking like, 'Oh, she's still working out every day,'\" she says. <\/p><p>Duhamel predicts that going forward, workout classes will put a heightened emphasis on individual needs, either out of care or — as clients demand more of it — necessity.&nbsp;<\/p><p>But if you want to see a change, it has to start with your own relationship with your body. Silver-Fagen surmises that everyone listens to what they see on Instagram, rather than listening to their body. \"People ask me, 'Should I eat before I work out?' What I say is, 'Are you hungry?' We've forgotten to just be mindful,\" she says. \"That's the key for everything.\"<\/p><p>Bronfman looks at it this way: \"It's really important for people to remember that you look like you for a reason, and it's the best thing that you've got going for you.\"<\/p><p>Start there, and you can go anywhere. For me, that's across the finish line, injury-free.<\/p><p><em>Homepage photo:&nbsp;Geber86<\/em><\/p><p><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\"><em>Never miss the latest fashion industry news.

The punchy exterior reflected the colors used throughout designer Paul Smith's collections, which could be found inside&nbsp;—&nbsp;but with the rise of social media, the well-sunlit wall became a go-to Instagram backdrop and tourist attraction that all but lost its ties to the British clothing label that owned it.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://fashionista.com/2017/04/paul-smith-pink-wall\">As we've noted<\/a>, Paul Smith did little to embrace the fact that it had an Instagram phenomenon on its hands — that is, until now. On Wednesday, Instagram and Paul Smith revealed that, in celebration of Pride 2017, the pair teamed up on a new rainbow mural to replace the iconic pink wall. Equally bright and bold as the original pink, the new mural is part of Instagram's global initiative to \"turn walls in cities around the world into colorful beacons of support.\" Paul Smith's is the first and the mural will be up through the LA Pride festival June 10-11.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BUzQwHBAk84\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BUzQwHBAk84\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18723106_1877442489173904_5617508380659679232_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>The mural is certainly impactful, not only because of its bright hues and social significance, but also because of the fact that it replaced an, albeit very unofficial, city landmark. If you say \"the pink wall\" to someone in Los Angeles, they know what you're talking about. That said, they might also roll their eyes a little bit. Perhaps it was time for the pink wall to get a fresh new look, and that the company chose to do it and finally leverage its social media success in a way that honors the LGBTQ community makes the new mural that much cooler.<\/p><p>In addition to encouraging users to support the community by taking photos and videos against the wall, it's also asking them to take part in its #kindcomments movement by leaving supportive comments on posts. The social media platform also launched a new set of pride stickers for Stories, all created by LGBTQ artists; each sticker can be tapped to find out who made it.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://fashionista.com/2015/06/wall-scouting-instagram\">Taking a photo against an \"Instagram wall\"<\/a> can feel frivolous and vain (because let's face it, it kind of is), but this is some #content you can feel good about making.

The category has gone through several iterations at this point:&nbsp;There's been the vlogger, the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/influencers\">influencer<\/a> and, most recently, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/04/microinfluencers-beauty-brands-social-media\">micro-influencer<\/a>. While cosmetics and skin-care brands like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/milk-makeup\">Milk&nbsp;Makeup<\/a>,&nbsp;The Ordinary — and, of course, the oft-cited <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/glossier\">Glossier<\/a> — have played a big role in reconfiguring the market landscape to better match millennial desires (both aesthetically and practically), we haven't exactly seen that shift toward a pared-down, minimalist approach mirrored in the beauty blogging sphere. Most beauty influencers have gained success by doing The Absolute Most (see: curling hair with Cheetos; applying foundation with a condom), so it's up to a new wave of beauty content creators to forge a simpler path.<\/p><p>After months of feeling fed up with what bloggers and vloggers were putting out into the world via their social feeds, I came across something fresh amidst all of the Inta-beauty clutter:&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://instagram.com/gelcream\">Gelcream<\/a> Instagram account. And even with one initial glance, it made me feel excited about beauty again. The photos are beautiful (which is especially impressive, given they're all captured on an&nbsp;iPhone); the reviews are concise, yet informative; and its tone is personal and authentic, two adjectives influencers are often striving for (though less often pull off, I'd argue). A quick scroll through the feed and you'll also notice a fairly major anomaly in the Insta-beauty sphere: There's also not a single selfie in sight.<\/p><p>Gelcream is an experience that more closely matches what most people (probably) want from a beauty account, which in turn helps explain how two weeks shy of its first birthday, Gelcream has amassed more than 13,000 followers with only 204 posts.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BTmYWKpgVOL\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BTmYWKpgVOL\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/18252148_767431386765256_6854410849684029440_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>While thousands of Instagram followers are no longer that hard to come by, there's another thing that sets Gelcream apart as a concept: When's the last time your favorite Instagrammer sent you an actual postcard? It's this type of grounded, sincere and atypical real-world communication that has helped bolster the account's dedicated and engaged community of beauty lovers and aesthetic connoisseurs.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Other than these tidbits available through the voyeurism of Instagram, Gelcream remains pretty mysterious. Who is behind the account? And what actually is Gelcream? An Instagram account? A beauty blog? A yet-to-be-launched store or business of some kind? I set out to answer those questions by tracking down the human force behind the impressively lit Instagram veneer.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BJ0Xb7RBYqf\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJ0Xb7RBYqf\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/14063639_834501646680638_1926213627_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Gelcream is the creation of Yana Sheptovetskaya, who is originally from Moscow and previously worked as a stylist at <em>AnOther<\/em> magazine, a fashion editor at Russian&nbsp;<em>Vogue<\/em>&nbsp;and managing director at fashion brand A.W.A.K.E before moving to San Francisco and then Los Angeles to pursue newer, glossier directions (and launch Gelcream). <\/p><p>Sheptovetskaya’s pedigree probably helps explain how she came to create the Instagram concept, which she describes as \"a beauty magazine; a collection of products and stories\" that she likes to think of as \"The Gentlewoman of Instagram.” Currently, Instagram is the only incarnation of the Gelcream concept — I hesitate to even call it a \"brand\" — because Sheptovetskaya gravitated toward the platform's ability to incite \"immediate responses\" from followers.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Gelcream is representative of the next wave in beauty blogging: clean, streamlined and decidedly millennial and transparent. The most eye-catching phrase in Gelcream’s bio is \"no ads,\" a notable departure from the gummy-bear-beauty-supplement-peddling beauty bloggers of the past few years. Sheptovetskaya stresses that she's not wholly opposed to turning Gelcream into a profit-seeking business; she's open to collaborations, but would likely need to take the form of \"a Gelcream pop-up somewhere or uniting with a great designer to do a little cosmetic bag collection,\" rather than paid product reviews.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Here's what else Sheptovetskaya had to say about what goes into creating the freshest, most interesting beauty account on Instagram.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BTAQRGEA7fY\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BTAQRGEA7fY\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/17934044_276673099458370_1730694691541745664_n.jpg\"><\/div><p><strong>When did Gelcream launch?<\/strong><\/p><p>In two weeks it will be one year since I started Gelcream. I bought <a href=\"http://rstyle.me/~9W4pU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luna Oil by Sunday Riley<\/a> and really loved the packaging and the blue color of this oil, so I photographed it and first published on my personal Instagram. I love lists, so I thought it would be a great idea to start a separate account where I can document my beauty experiences. [The inspiriation for the name of the account came from] the writing on a bottle of <a href=\"http://rstyle.me/~9W4q5\">La Mer's Moisturizing Gel Cream<\/a>. It all happened within few minutes: I checked the name, it was available and it fit me perfectly. I love being simple and straightforward in descriptions. I never had plans for Gelcream. It was a sudden, emotional decision.<\/p><p><strong>What was the impetus for creating Gelcream?<\/strong><\/p><p>I was always fascinated by the magic of&nbsp;beauty products. The first lipstick I bought I didn't even use. It was my little talisman, a sign of sensuality, a little secret. I love beauty products for creating an emotion.&nbsp;I am thrilled when I open the box for the first time, touch the bottle and smell the product. It's a very intimate and relaxing time to look at yourself in the mirror and think (or not think at all) while taking care of yourself. On Gelcream, I'm sharing the emotion every products creates with my readers.<\/p><p><strong>What type of beauty community or discussions do you hope Gelcream fosters?<\/strong><\/p><p>I hope Gelcream serves as an eye to see the beauty of the skin-care products and stops time for a second. What I don't want to get involved in is the skin-care issues; I don't have enough knowledge to advise how to deal with skin conditions and believe that there are two types of beauty products: those that maintain and those that treat. I focus on the first ones.<\/p><p><strong>You've built a&nbsp;strong,&nbsp;involved community pretty quickly. Can you tell me a little bit about that? <\/strong><\/p><p>I am very romantic, and I love letters. One day I thought that I wanted to say my readers, \"Hi and thank you,\" and decided to do it the way I would love to receive it, via old school mail. I've already received few letters back and I can't stop smiling when I read them. Isn't that the goal?<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BRmEXl8AlJv\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRmEXl8AlJv\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/17333167_158280591358145_157902681636077568_n.jpg\"><\/div><p><strong>How do you see Gelcream as being different from other content creation in the beauty space on Instagram?<\/strong><\/p><p>I don't focus on skin conditions and hard-core beauty routines. It is more meditative, minimal content. Maybe it's because I'm being honest in my reviews and I don't try to seem that I know everything or that I've tried everything. I'm trying to keep it real and beautiful.<\/p><p><strong>Do you plan to eventually monetize Gelcream? What do you see as the full potential or realization of it? <\/strong><\/p><p>I don't want to rush anything, but I would love to make Gelcream a bigger part of my life. I have a lot of ideas and I'm working hard on making them real. Gelcream is my exploration of beauty. I would love for it to become that lipstick, a talisman, that reminds people that beauty and harmony are within us and all those products are just helping us to find it.<\/p><p>I would love for Gelcream to get physical and become something like a <a href=\"https://hollywoodphotographs.com/category/39-1/schwabs-drug/\">Schwab's Pharmacy<\/a>&nbsp;— a space where like-minded people can drink, shop, hang out, work. A very easy atmosphere with good music. Maybe one day.<\/p><p><strong>Why was this past year the right time for you to start Gelcream?<\/strong><\/p><p>I love it as a platform where I can experiment and the freedom it gives, especially comparing it with the times I worked in fashion magazines, where every step had to be confirmed with several people. I constantly test different features. Soon I'll introduce stories photographed by the readers and independent photographers, which I'm excited about. What also makes me happy is that I can do what I want [with the platform]. I couldn't imagine having a chance to send more than 300 postcards to different parts of the world before; that was be a dream of mine and it came true thanks to Gelcream. I feel like I have 300 friends now, it is so amazing! I want to continue doing those little things that bring joy to me and readers.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BTZepZ1gyyZ\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BTZepZ1gyyZ\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/18160656_1945515439013890_6339500745418604544_n.jpg\"><\/div><p><strong>It's interesting that your hands are shown but your face never is.

Also, I really like <a href=\"https://www.peachandlily.com/products/uka-nail-oil-24-45\">UKA cuticle oils<\/a>.

tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Two years ago, <em>The New York Times<\/em>&nbsp;published an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html\">in-depth exposé <\/a>about the lack of oversight — and general disregard for workers' well-being and basic rights —&nbsp;in the New York City&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/nails\">nail<\/a> salon industry. That story&nbsp;uncovered hard data and anecdotal evidence that made it hard to go on (as many had for years) willfully ignoring that perhaps a&nbsp;$7 <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/manicure\">manicure<\/a> came at a greater cost. In addition to concerns about compensation and labor practices, there were issues about cleanliness and the health and safety of salon employees; many of the workers were immigrants who spoke little English and had limited opportunity to advocate for themselves.&nbsp;Almost immediately after the <em>Times<\/em>'s story, <a href=\"http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/316-15/de-blasio-administration-multifaceted-effort-address-labor-abuses-health-risks-at\">the City's mayor promised to take action<\/a> and implement practices that would correct labor abuses and protect workers' rights and health. But another result was that the patrons of New York&nbsp;nail salons began to pay attention and ask questions.<\/p><p>It was in this climate that respected nail salons like <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/tenoverten\">Tenoverten<\/a>, Jin Soon and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/paintbox\">Paintbox<\/a>&nbsp;flourished, preaching an elevated mani-pedi experience and assuring their clients that the treatment of their employees was of utmost importance. Tenoverten — with its chic decor, polish line and streamlined service menu&nbsp;— and Paintbox — with its complimentary wine, menu of glitzy nail designs and manicure selfie station — also helped to change the conversation about nail salons. But what's more, both helped&nbsp;drive home that&nbsp;manicures could be a capital-E Experience rather than merely routine bodily maintenance.<\/p><p>The Paintboxes and Tenovertens set&nbsp;new standards for what the modern nail salon could&nbsp;be, raising the bar and paving the way for others to innovate in the space, as well. This spring, a&nbsp;fresh crop of nail salons are picking up that baton and pushing the concept of a nail studio further,&nbsp;focusing on Insta-bait interiors and laid-back vibes that invite customers to just hang out, even if they're not planning on getting a service. That laid-back-ness is the driving force behind both Sundays, a combination nail salon/meditation studio and Chillhouse, a coffee shop-meets-nail art bar-meets-massage studio — both of which opened the doors to their first in New York&nbsp;locations in March.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0209a457b00025e8\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"The manicure stations at Sundays. Photo: Sundays\"><\/div><p><a href=\"http://www.dearsundays.com/\">Sundays<\/a>, a lofted, airy spot tucked a block away from Madison Square Park, was the result of founder and CEO Amy Ling Lin's desire to build a business that could change the nail salon industry and help her fellow immigrants in the process. Lin, who arrived in the United States from China in 2006 and went on to obtain a degree from Columbia Business School, saw an industry in need of change. \"This industry actually has been operated by an overwhelming number of immigrants,\" she says. \"When I came to this industry, I discovered the issues: The work hours are unstable, and there are so many chemicals being used. A lot of [the immigrants working in salons] don't necessarily speak English, so they just take whatever they're given...Most of the salons in New York are&nbsp;using the same product, and they're not necessarily very healthy.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>For Lin, creating nontoxic nail polishes was crucial. That's why, when the Sundays studio launched, it did so with its own line of products. But there also are two other significant ways in which Sundays is a big step up from your average nail salon: Its spare Scandinavian design, which is truly the stuff of Instagram dreams, and the fact that <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/meditation\">meditation<\/a> is baked right in to the mani-pedi experience.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0209a44f200027d8\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Three nail polishes from Sundays's product lineup. Photo:&amp;nbsp;Sundays\"><\/div><p>First, about those interiors: Lin was inspired by — what else? — <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/pinterest\">Pinterest<\/a>. \"It's Scandinavian style design. I saw this picture of this house covered by snow, but there's light coming through and it's so warm and nice. The weather is so bad [in Scandinavian countries], so people stay indoors, and make their homes so cozy and beautiful,\" she says. That cozy factor was the number-one priority for Lin, while Instagram shareability became secondary. You won't find a designated selfie station at Sundays, but really, the entire space is its own sort of selfie station.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Then there's the meditation component, a wellness activity that's ancient but <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/04/guided-meditation-app-fashion-industry\">has caught on like wildfire in the past year<\/a>, especially among the fashion crowd. For Lin, who had practiced meditation as a child and rediscovered it in adulthood during a business school retreat, bringing meditation into the nail salon just made sense. \"I discovered that when women&nbsp;get their nails done, many of them tend to close their eyes and really&nbsp;want to be relaxed,\" she says. Adding in a brief guided meditation session allows them to both maximize the experience by multi-tasking but also engage in a more thorough&nbsp;chill session. Clients are given the option to listen to guided meditation sessions via <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/inscape\">Inscape<\/a>'s mobile app or even to just put on headphones and tune out with some chill music.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0209a456000025e8\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"The pedicure stations at Sundays. Photo: Sundays\"><\/div><p>Lin knows that the concept of meditation can be intimidating and says she's still at a beginner level herself. So rather than approaching it&nbsp;in a serious or stuffy way, Sundays is about creating an accessible way dip their toes into the practice while they're also (literally) dipping their toes into a pedicure tub. Leave it to New Yorkers to find a way to multi-task and maximize their chill time.<\/p><p>That same multi-tasking concept is at play in <a href=\"http://chillhouse.com/\">Chillhouse<\/a>, though rather than combining manicures with meditation, it brings lattes and massage into the mix.&nbsp;Chillhouse's founder Cyndi Ramirez aims forcing anything on them. \"There's no preaching or shoving ideologies down your throat — and there's something here for everyone. I think people need a space that they can decompress without the financial burden, or feeling the pressure to part from your phone for too long,\" says Ramirez.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0209a44f000025e8\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Chillhouse's café. Photo: Chillhouse\"><\/div><p>She opened Chillhouse, a combination coffeehouse-nail salon-massage studio in March after identifying somewhat of a gap in New York's&nbsp;\"chill\" industry. \"My husband and I were trying to get massages one day and we realized we only had two options: either super cheap, somewhat seedy basement spots, or upscale, luxury spas. This ignited a conversation about what's missing in the relaxation-space as a whole,\" she says. \"We chatted about how 'third spaces' exist for men — Blind Barber, Three Seat Espresso — but it hasn't really been introduced for women. Someone needed to fix that.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>She set out to do just that. But in the interest of inclusivity and all-encompassing relaxation, Ramirez expanded the concept. \"We later realized how nail salons aren't an inviting place for significant others to go hang out. I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to get a manicure after brunch and [my husband] refuses to join me because he feels weird taking up a manicure chair. That's where the nails came in. We agreed on these two non-invasive services paired with a full-service café and then the name Chillhouse popped into mind. We decided to build a space for everyone: café, manicures, massages.\"<\/p><p>Like Sundays, Chillhouse strives to be a healthier environment than traditional nail salons, both for clients and for employees.&nbsp;\"We have a built-in ventilation system that is beautifully designed into our tables to maintain a nontoxic environment,\" explains Ramirez. But interior design played another&nbsp;crucial role in making her vision a reality, beyond the practical, utilitarian aspects.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0209a44f200025e8\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Chillhouse's Insta-bait wallpaper and Tumblr pink baseboards. Photo: Chillhouse\"><\/div><p>Chillhouse's aesthetic is one of carefully honed Insta-bait perfection; the pale wood tables, dreamy wallpaper, marble nail stations, big leafy plants and neon \"chill\" wall art are all there to cultivate a deeply relaxing ambiance — and to drive home Chillhouse's brand while also goading clients into creating and sharing Chillhouse-centric content. \"I'd say branding and design is the backbone of the business and singlehandedly creates its identity,\" says Ramirez. \"Everything from our exteriors to our artwork has a rhyme and reason. Our gradient in our exterior is supposed to be synonymous to the flow of the chill inside the property. Our nail art is also influenced by our branding. Everything is synergetic.\"<\/p><p>Ramirez also pays careful attention to the partners and products Chillhouse carries and uses in its treatments. Those brands in and of themselves are trendy Instagram darlings very much in keeping with the Chillhouse brand: Boysmells candles, <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/03/sakara-organic-food-meal-delivery-superfoods-service\">Sakara<\/a> snacks and Little Barn Apothecary skin-care products.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0209b869000026e9\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Chillhouse's nail stations. Photo: Chillhouse\"><\/div><p>Ramirez isn't shy about owning up to the fact that Chillhouse caters&nbsp;to Instagrammers. In fact, it's key to her business concept. \"If you don't design with shareability in mind, then you're doing it wrong,\" she says. \"Functionality is most important; comfort is important, too — but nowadays, social is your biggest marketing tool.\" That also goes for the food, of course. \"Our lattes are delicious first, and beautiful second. Our neon has obviously been a very Instagrammable moment in the space, but we also thought it was important for us to have it in there as a branding pinpoint inside the property.&nbsp;<\/p><p>So far, that's been a successful tactic for the shop. \"I'd say seven out of 10 are sharing their experience [on social media]. I'd even go as far as saying eight out of 10 takes a photo of some kind, even if they haven't shared it yet. I try to ask almost everyone I encounter how they heard about us, and nine out of 10 have said Instagram. Isn't that insane?\"<\/p><p>With that in mind, Ramirez doesn't rule out paid influencer marketing as a means of continuing to grow the company. \"We've already had a bunch [of influencers] come by organically, but I am a strong believer in the power of influencer marketing,\" she explains. \"It's also the backbone of your brand identity: Who hangs out here? Who's our target customer? Who do they follow, and why? Inviting those influencers in will inspire your ideal customer to walk through the doors.\"<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BTEcmjqgQeM\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BTEcmjqgQeM\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/17932121_160653214461766_7422370126541881344_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>In terms of immediate plans, Ramirez says the next step for the business will be to implement a membership model.&nbsp;\"We want to activate our neighborhood and encourage folks to treat this as their third space — home, work, Chillhouse,\" she says. She also hints at possible branded product extensions, though she's tight-lipped about what exactly that may be.<\/p><p>It may be easy to view both Chillhouse and Sundays as of-the-moment and trendy as hell. But that doesn't mean they'll be fleeting. Both Ramirez and Lin see their respective businesses as evolutions of the industry, setting a new standard and bringing a more mindful approach to the market as a whole.&nbsp;\"I absolutely love the wellness movement happening right now, but I feel like the bubble could potentially burst,\" says Ramirez. That's where the relatable branding and accessible price points come in.&nbsp;\"While we're certainly in the wellness vicinity, Chillhouse's goal is to inspire the act of relaxation in very approachable ways,\" she adds.&nbsp;<\/p><p>So, why is 2017 the exact right moment for these ultra-pretty chill spaces to emerge — and to succeed? There's the pessimistic answer, that we're all content-creating zombies, obsessed with scoring more likes, and planning our daily activities and routines around maximizing Instagramability. But there's also the more realistic one: In an era when many people feel paralyzed in an ever-expanding, overwhelming quicksand of Trump-administration-induced doom and gloom, we're turning to <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2016/11/how-to-de-stress\">self care<\/a>. And, being New Yorkers, we're into multitasking. Why not combine multiple relaxation methods into one tidy, efficient package?&nbsp;If you can be in a pretty space and get a nontoxic manicure while simultaneously engaging in a&nbsp;guided meditation or sipping on a turmeric latte, you should, because dammit, you deserve that time for yourself. And if you happen to get the perfect Instagram shot out of the whole thing, well, that's cool, too.

Photo: <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BSj6enagaIZ/&quot;>@origins/Instagram<\/a>\"><\/div><p>A decade ago, if you brought up the subject of \"influencers\" to someone in beauty marketing,&nbsp;they'd have probably have responded with a blank stare at best. Of course beauty bloggers and vloggers existed then — and some of them even had massive followings — but nobody yet was really leveraging or courting them&nbsp;to pimp out their products. And the idea of<em>&nbsp;paying<\/em>&nbsp;one of these bloggers to promote something would have been considered even more absurd. After all, <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/04/kendall-jenner-pepsi-commercial\">that's what celebrities are for, right?<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/04/bridal-brands-wedding-market-planning-style-influencers\" rel=\"nofollow\">The rise of influencers<\/a>, both as a concept and as a commodity, has been meteoric, thanks in part to the increasing proliferation of social media into every facet of our lives, but also because major brands have started buying into them. And they've seen returns as a result.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BS4NLUvD4aN\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BS4NLUvD4aN\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/17932099_410148846019736_8994387599225257984_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>\"When we started&nbsp;talking about the business five years ago, there really were the top hundred bloggers who were getting deals with brands, but beyond that nobody was getting any deals,\" says James Nord, &nbsp;co-founder of Fohr Card, a service that helps match up brands and influencers. It made sense, after all, for brands to court the social celebs who everybody was watching. Profitable, too, for the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/03/moscow-russia-fashion-influencers\" rel=\"nofollow\">influencers<\/a>, some of whom reportedly picked up six- and even seven-figure paydays for a&nbsp;few posts on their social media.&nbsp;But, as is the case with so many cottage industries, issues quickly began to arise. A small group of influencers were attracting all of the brands, and as feeds became saturated with promoted activations, followers also became more savvy about picking out and ignoring sponsored posts. Social platforms themselves also started cracking down on undeclared sponsorship, and questions about ROI started cropping up when mega-followers didn't always translate to mega-sales.&nbsp;<\/p><p>That's why some beauty brands have begun transferring their ad&nbsp;dollars to a new subset of tastemakers: \"microinfluencers.\" Less renowned than their flashy influencer counterparts, microinfluencers are thought to have higher engagement and more authentic connections with followers.&nbsp;Though there's no official standardized&nbsp;number of followers that differentiates a microinfluencer from a full-fledged influencer, some estimates suggest as few as 1,500 followers can nab you the title. Nord places it at as many as 50,000 (\"bigger than any baseball stadium in the country,\"), but other experts say that any follower count below the 100,000 mark qualifies. The key attractions of a microinfluencer are more concrete: a highly engaged fanbase, a lower price point, ease of marketing and that all-important aforementioned authenticity.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BRq3a0TAd8j\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRq3a0TAd8j\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/17267988_107034913165644_2882373292742672384_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Marketing via microinfluencer has caught on in a big way in the beauty industry over the last year alone.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/origins\">Origins<\/a>, of <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/02/origins-active-charcoal-mask-review\" rel=\"nofollow\">using-charcoal-before-it-was-cool fame<\/a>, announced last month that it would be <a href=\"http://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/skin-care/origins-estee-lauder-taps-micro-influencers-for-a-perfect-world-10852421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnering with nine microinfluencers<\/a> to launch a new set of skin-care products aimed at women between the ages of 24 and 35. Estée Lauder (which owns Origins, as well as Clinique) has struggled to find success among millennial women&nbsp;in the skin category, so this new effort is no doubt an attempt to change that. <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/elf\">Elf<\/a>'s microinfluencer initiative —&nbsp;Beautyscape, which brings microinfluencers together in a kind of mini-conference to play with the brand's products, learn techniques and mingle with each other — has been around for a few years now, but it's receiving renewed attention.<\/p><p>\"In just\n two years, Beautyscape events have become <em>the<\/em> destination for our influencers to come\n together to learn, connect, be inspired and inspire others. Content generated from this\n initiative has a combined reach of more than 250 million across digital platforms,\" says Mara McCune, Elf's vice president of brand. She highlights that reach, as well as engagement, in discussing the success behind partnering with microinfluencers.<\/p><p>Nord agrees, emphasizing that microinfluencers are often bringing macro engagement in the form of likes, comments and other signs that their audience is genuinely paying attention to what they have to say. \"Often the smaller followings do have better engagement rates, and they haven’t gotten big enough yet where there are people who follow them just because they have a big following. If you look at our data, naturally as a following grows engagement percentage falls, so the average engagement for somebody with 50,000 followers is about twice the size as somebody with a million&nbsp;followers.\" Given that kind of payoff, it makes far more sense, from a brand's perspective, to recruit a handful of microinfluencers who are reaching different audiences than to shell out for one big name who may not drive sales.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BSZENflFCXr\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BSZENflFCXr\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/17493942_1306068576146624_7874984367288745984_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Of course, it's not all about numbers, it's also about trust. Especially with a category like beauty, which can be so personal, that's not to be underestimated. \"Microinfluencers tend to have a much more genuine following. They have built their audience by delivering trusted content that their audience values and a move in a less authentic direction would impact their ability to grow,\" says McCune. \"So when these influencers talk about Elf or review one of our products, their followers really listen.\"&nbsp;Particularly for the millennial-and-younger crowd, a group notoriously resistant to traditional marketing&nbsp;—&nbsp;64 percent of millennials use an ad blocker on their computer, phone or both, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Most-Millennials-Have-Installed-Ad-Blockers/1014592\">according to Emarketer<\/a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;the feeling that they're able to trust an influencer's opinion has proven to be very effective.<\/p><p>That trust isn't necessarily&nbsp;misplaced, either. A hair-care expert from Saskatchewan, for example, may not have the celebrity clients&nbsp;a big name in the LA does, but their years of experience hardly make them less qualified to give advice. \"There's been a democratization of expertise,\" says Nord. \"I think the word 'influencer' gets beat up a little bit, but these are really just experts in their fields.\" He also points out that unlike celebs, whose images are carefully maintained and codified, microinfluencers and their fans often share a close connection, opening up discussions around products and techniques as well as details about their personal lives, their pets, as well as <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/01/manny-gutierrez-maybelline-male-ambassador\" rel=\"nofollow\">issues of diversity<\/a> often overlooked by mainstream beauty marketing&nbsp;like <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2015/03/fashion-blogging-diversity\" rel=\"nofollow\">race, size and identity<\/a>. That sense that an audience \"knows\" them is a huge factor in what allows influencers to gain their followers trust and, in turn, their cash-money when it comes to buying products or services they recommend.&nbsp;<\/p><p>How authentic that opinion is, of course, <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2016/12/influencer-trends-2017\" rel=\"nofollow\">varies by brand and by microinfluencer<\/a>, but Nord has a generally optimistic opinion of how much honesty really goes into a partnership. \"The amount of influencers we have who come in and turn down $10,000&nbsp;from us because the product doesn’t make sense for their audience is really encouraging for me. The fact that we have people turn down $30,000 deals because they feel like they couldn't authentically speak on behalf of that product makes me feel really good.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>For Elf,&nbsp;McCune notes that openness and honesty is&nbsp;built into the way the brand addresses&nbsp;microinfluencers, which is to let them create their own branded content. \"We ask them to be truthful – to share their candid thoughts on our  products, tell us what else they want to see from Elf and tell us what we could be doing better,\" she says. \"We have found that they understand who we are and are able to help tell our story without needing to provide specific guidelines.\"&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BRh34Zaleye\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BRh34Zaleye\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/17126511_297799377303332_2227579599749906432_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Of course, no one could have predicted that influencer marketing would take off the way it has&nbsp;—&nbsp;mainly because no one could have predicted the rise of social media itself and the twists and turns it has thrown us&nbsp;—&nbsp;so it's entirely possible that by the time you're reading this, the internet will have collapsed, social media will be a thing of the past and we'll all be regretting making fun of doomsday preppers. Barring a technopocalypse, though, it's certainly looking like microinfluencers are set to keep growing — especially within the beauty realm. What that means for the future of commerce, and e-commerce in particular, has yet to be seen. Nord is betting on a move away from part-time influencing to full-time pros. \"I think that what were going to see over the next few years is a trend generally towards professionalism. I think that the influencers who will continue to be successful are the ones who are running these things like businesses,\" he says.

So, the FTC is once again stepping in, making sure that any \"material connection\" an Instagrammer has with a brand that could potentially affect the post's credibility is crystal clear.<\/p><p>In a blog posted to <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2017/04/influencers-are-your-materialconnection-disclosures\">the FTC's website<\/a> on Wednesday — complete with the delightfully salty title, \"Influencers, are your #materialconnection #disclosures #clearandconspicuous?\" — the agency outlines rules with the hope to&nbsp;\"influence influencers to comply with [the] established principles in their Instagram posts,\" particularly in regards to making it obvious when they're paid for by a brand. The post reads:&nbsp;\"Avoid #HardtoRead #BuriedDisclosures #inStringofHashtags #SkippedByReaders. When posts end with a jumble of hashtags, how likely is it that people really read them? That's why a 'disclosure' placed in a string of other hashtags isn't likely to be effective.\" In addition, indefinite&nbsp;terms like \"thank you TK brand,\"&nbsp;\"#partner,\" and \"#sp\" are frowned upon, as they don't distinctly define the poster's relationship with an advertiser.&nbsp;<\/p><p>To drive this point home, the FTC sent out more than 90 letters to influencers on Wednesday containing the above information — meaning that a crackdown is likely nigh. We absolutely can't knock the hustle, but dearest bloggers and celebrities, believe us when we say that your #confusinghashtags are #notfoolinganyone. By all means, make that money, but just remember to use \"#Ad\" while you're doing it.<\/p><p><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\"><em>Never miss the latest fashion industry news.

By September 2015, she officially launched the Instagram account @dressedtomatch to document more of these serendipitous sartorial moments. She started gaining followers, currently nearing 8K, and her hashtag #dressedtomatch, where she finds photos to regram, is just under 2K posts.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;><div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;><\/div><\/div> <p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;> <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BPBjYJ7ApOj/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Complementary colors ♦️◾️🔰🔹◽️ I&amp;#39;m #dressedtomatch Roland Petersen&amp;#39;s painting at my alma mater&amp;#39;s new art museum, the @manettishrem! #liketkit Find more information about their inaugural exhibition at the link in profile and find my dress here: http://liketk.it/2q514 @liketoknow.it<\/a><\/p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by Dressed To Match (@dressedtomatch) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-01-09T00:55:32+00:00&quot;>Jan 8, 2017 at 4:55pm PST<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote> <script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p>\"For me, it's a passion project that allows me to be creative,\" says Satterlee. \"I don’t paint, but I have a degree in art history, and I know so much about art. I have a huge appreciation for it, so this is kind of like my method of making art.\"<\/p><p>Satterlee's process behind @dressedtomatch is quite selective in terms of seeking out and making matches. She upholds a certain look and high quality with her photos, and so does her audience. \"There's an expectation that I'm going to put out really unique things and that's kind of the challenge for me and the fun of it,\" she says. Palette is number one for Satterlee: If something doesn't match color-wise, it's not going to match at all. Then comes the overall patterning of the garments and the content in the art piece: Do they mimic each other? Finally, there's posing for the photo. It's more than just a simple hand-on-hip situation: Satterlee aims to align herself to the piece in order to best represent the match.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"embedcode\" tml-external-id=\"\" tml-embed-src=\"<blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;><div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.31481481481481% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;> <div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;><\/div><\/div> <p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;> <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BQa54pKhTis/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>She&amp;#39;s cut out for the match! 💙🌿❤️ #dressedtomatch 📷:@artfullyawear ・・・ &amp;#34;Another word for creativity is courage.&amp;#34; #HenriMatisse 🌿 #LACMAplusyou<\/a><\/p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by Dressed To Match (@dressedtomatch) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2017-02-12T17:44:37+00:00&quot;>Feb 12, 2017 at 9:44am PST<\/time><\/p><\/div><\/blockquote> <script async defer src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;><\/script>\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\"><\/div><p>As for keeping her collection of dresses (her favorite style of clothing, by the way) up to par with her artistic surroundings, Satterlee says she always keeps a stockpile of potential matches, from contemporary to historical artworks, in the back of her mind. \"As I'm browsing, certain things will pop up to me that are reminiscent of specific pieces that I want to match,\" she says. \"That's how I'm able to juggle and not just focus on one thing.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>The stores Satterlee shops at run the gamut, but she prefers high-end retailers, like <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/neiman-marcus\">Neiman Marcus<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/saks-fifth-avenue\">Saks Fifth Avenue<\/a>, for their&nbsp;more artistically inspired designer pieces;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/anthropologie\">Anthropologie<\/a> is also a favorite.

As a jewelry designer, she's been commissioned to make pieces for the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/victorias-secret-fashion-show\">Victoria's Secret Fashion Show<\/a> and landed editorial placement in international editions of <em>Vogue<\/em>; as a model, she's represented beauty and fashion brands like <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/loreal\">L'Oréal<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/urban-outfitters\">Urban Outfitters<\/a>; as a style icon, she’s attracted the attention of Man Repeller, The Cut and <em>V <\/em>Magazine&nbsp;— not to mention a little publication called Fashionista, where she was <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2013/12/street-style-arpana-looks-cool-in-floppy-hat-and-red-leather-sunglasses\">scouted for her street style<\/a> back in 2013.<\/p><p>But what's perhaps most amazing is that Rayamajhi has made all of the above happen without help from a team of agents and PR professionals. She still personally hand-makes every piece of jewelry in her line — including each of the elaborate pieces worn on the Victoria's Secret runway — and all of her modeling gigs have come about organically, usually through people finding her on <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/instagram\">Instagram<\/a>.<\/p><p>So, how did the former art student from Kathmandu, Nepal become such a sensation in New York? She attributes her success to a balance between hard work and lucky timing.<\/p><p>\"I'm really fortunate,\" she says. \"I do my part, but there's a lot of things life just offers you. I've learned to accept them.\"<\/p><p>Having grown up in Nepal, Rayamajhi got her start in New York as a student at Cooper Union, where she studied painting and sculpture. But the heady mix of art history and academic criticism she encountered in class made her hungry to return to the things that had drawn her to art in the first place — namely, that it was \"fun and it felt good.\" Shortly thereafter, she began making her own earrings and necklaces. Besides providing her with a way to source beautiful pieces for her own outfits, jewelry-making satisfied Rayamajhi's instinct toward creative work without all the ideological baggage of traditional fine art.<\/p><p>That unique starting point has continued to inform how Rayamajhi designs, and it's clear that the 29-year-old still thinks of herself more in art terms than fashion ones. Her concept-driven pieces incorporate unusual materials like synthetic neon hair from wigs and pencil erasers, in addition to beads she sources from her travels around the world. Each piece is one of a kind, and Rayamajhi sometimes displays them&nbsp;in gallery settings as one would a collection of paintings. One of her best customers has even told her that they purchased an intricate Rayamajhi piece for the express purpose of hanging it on the wall rather than wearing it. <\/p><div tml-collection=\"ci0206d5a0000026cd\" tml-render-style=\"slideshow\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\">\n    \n    \n    \n<\/div><p>\"Jewelry and studio art-making are obviously different disciplines in some ways, but for me they collide. I'm somewhere in between art and design,\" says Rayamajhi.<\/p><p>She's also somewhere between being a maker and a muse. While Rayamajhi didn't set out to be a model and claims she doesn't have the \"physicality for modeling\" — she's a very petite 5'4\" — her appearance has been a boon for her jewelry business. While she often got stopped on the street&nbsp;when she first moved to New York in 2008&nbsp;to ask whether she was represented by a modeling agency, it wasn't until she lost her mother to cancer and graduated from Cooper Union&nbsp;at age 27 that she really considered modeling.<\/p><p>\"I began understanding that I don't know how long I have to live, I don't know what's going to happen with my life,\" she says. \"I thought, 'I might as well do as much as I can to share my work with people.' That's when I started putting myself out there on social media. Initially, it was just to show my work.\"<\/p><p>While the response to her jewelry was enthusiastic online, Rayamajhi also found that the response to pictures of herself were just as positive. As her colorful personal style and striking features continued to rack up&nbsp;likes, Rayamajhi found herself getting invited to model for a variety of projects.<\/p><p>Never one to waste an opportunity to promote her design work, Rayamajhi brought some of her jewelry to her first editorial shoot, which was with&nbsp;London-based <em>10 <\/em>Magazine. While she didn't have an elaborate business plan or a manager helping her to promote herself, that simple action turned out to be one of the most strategic decisions she could've made. The magazine's founder <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/sophia-neophitou-apostolou\">Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou<\/a>&nbsp;also happens to be the the creative director of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. When she saw Rayamajhi's designs, she immediately asked her to consider making pieces for the show.<\/p><p>\"The next day, I was in the Victoria's Secret office signing contracts,\" says Rayamajhi.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0206d589d00026b7\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Rayamajhi in her studio. Photo: Whitney Bauck/Fashionista\"><\/div><p>The pieces she designed for the lingerie giant&nbsp;ended up being worn by <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/kendall-jenner\">Kendall Jenner<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/adriana-lima\">Adriana Lima<\/a> as part of the show's \"The Road Ahead\" segment, and helped Rayamajhi attract attention that led to numerous interviews and even a coveted spot on <em>The<\/em> <em>New York Times'<\/em>&nbsp;\"30 Under 30\" list. And while big modeling gigs like the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/loreal\">L'Oréal<\/a><a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/01/loreal-true-match-campaign-diversity\">&nbsp;campaign<\/a> she appeared in alongside the likes of <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/hari-nef\">Hari Nef<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/blake-lively\">Blake Lively<\/a> can't be directly traced to her involvement at Victoria's Secret, the extra exposure certainly didn't hurt.<\/p><p>While Rayamajhi has come to enjoy modeling, she's perhaps most excited by the way her jewelry has taken off. Having lost a parent while still young has made her hesitant to get too attached to longterm plans — \"I don't even know if I'll be alive in five years,\" she claims — but she does hope to eventually hire others to work on the brand with her, maybe even employing specialized artisans from around the world. <\/p><p>\"I'd love to someday collaborate on jewelry for brands like <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/gucci\">Gucci<\/a>, <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/hussein-chalayan\">Hussein Chalayan<\/a> or <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/alexander-mcqueen\">Alexander McQueen<\/a>,\" she says.<\/p><p>Still, the fact that she still sees herself first and foremost as an artist means she's open to exploring other mediums, too. Expressing her strong opinions on everything from <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/cultural-appropriation\">cultural appropriation<\/a> (\"we should focus on systematic oppression by addressing the issue as exactly that, not by creating a symptomatic problem like cultural appropriation\") to animal rights (\"human beings are not the center of this planet; we share this planet with animals and we are totally destroying it\") is important to Rayamajhi and will undoubtedly show up in whatever kind of work she makes in the long run.<\/p><p>\"I'm just trying to work with jewelry right now and see where that takes me,\" she says. If her recent history is any indication, we're betting it will take her far.<\/p><p><em><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\">Sign up for our daily newsletter and get the latest industry news in your inbox every day.&nbsp;<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b90f5000024c1"],"primaryImageId":"ci0206d568100026cd","path":"/2017/03/arpana-rayamajhi-jewlery-designer-model","associatedRichTerms":[{"publicationTimestamp":"2014-04-11T10:53:52Z","commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01ada8614001f41e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Victoria's Secret","vocabularyId":"cs01944391a956860f:designers","editedTimestamp":"2014-04-11T10:53:11Z","disqusId":"77e01840-c167-11e3-9e18-52540010071f","path":"/designers/victorias-secret","slug":"victorias-secret","displayName":"Victoria's Secret"},{"$ref":"ci0206d4ea300026cd"},{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2015-10-15T14:51:12Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"metaDescription":"Careers | Fashion Industry News, Designers, Runway Shows, Style Advice","id":"ci020b90f5000024c1","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"Careers","primaryImage":{"height":422,"cloudinaryVersionId":1446479662,"id":"ci01dca43b30019512","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"Careers Section Heading","primaryPhotoId":"ci01dca43b30019512","hasFaces":false,"width":1411,"publicId":"assets/MTM0MTYyNjYxNDE5MDQyODI2","format":"jpg","bytes":102567,"migrationId":"95d2cdf58402c95fc4b87a21ec8b7f3d31944933"},"vocabularyId":"cs01944391a956860f:sections","editedTimestamp":"2017-06-05T23:14:15Z","disqusId":"46ea6265-40fc-11e7-966b-066758d48690","titleImageId":"ci01dca43ad00099de","titleBackgroundImageId":"ci020c8a0aa000266d","primaryImageId":"ci01dca43b30019512","path":"/fashion-careers","overviewTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" -->","slug":"fashion-careers","displayName":"Careers","metaTitle":"Careers | Fashionista","migrationId":"section-transition-ci01db2dc500039512"},{"isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2016-06-14T15:59:35Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01ef2e667000275e","objectType":"ContentRichTerm","isNoindex":false,"title":"L'Oreal","vocabularyId":"cs01944391a956860f:designers","editedTimestamp":"2016-06-14T15:59:36Z","disqusId":"fdbb6903-3248-11e6-9c77-02108d1aa3af","path":"/designers/loreal-216","slug":"loreal-216","displayName":"L'Oreal","promoTitle":"L'Oreal"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6c204000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6b679000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6a864000efe2"}],"socialPopularity":603,"slug":"arpana-rayamajhi-jewlery-designer-model","contentNodeId":"cn0206d450200026b7","authorProfile":{"editedTimestamp":"2017-01-05T18:26:55Z","isInstantArticle":false,"photo":{"height":2331,"cloudinaryVersionId":1483640664,"id":"ci020014bda000251c","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"headshot crop-6059.jpg","primaryPhotoId":"ci020014bda000251c","hasFaces":true,"width":3253,"publicId":"MTQ0MTM3OTkxNjY3ODUzMjU4","format":"jpg","bytes":2252324},"publicationTimestamp":"2016-06-13T17:00:14Z","isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci01ef1a30b000275e","objectType":"ContentUserProfile","isNoindex":false,"title":"Whitney Bauck","primaryImage":{"$ref":"ci020014bda000251c"},"slug":"whitney-bauck","disqusId":"40bb0d0b-3188-11e6-82c4-0284275646f7","bio":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>Whitney Bauck is an assistant editor at Fashionista.

It can be a social experience, and a deeply personal one; at times, it can be impulsive and entertaining, at others, purpose-driven, a chore. Where do you shop? When do you shop? How do you decide what you need, how much to spend, and what's \"you\"? These are some of the questions we're putting to prominent figures in the fashion industry with our column, \"<a href=\"http://www.fashionista.com/tag/how-i-shop\">How I Shop<\/a>.\"<\/em><\/p><p>If you haven't heard of Reese Blutstein, chances are you've seen her signature <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2017/03/blunt-cut-bob-hairstyle-trend-2017\">blunt bob<\/a> and killer outfits on <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/instagram\">Instagram<\/a>. The 20-year-old student and blogger has been attracting a massive following under her handle <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/double3xposure/\">@double3xposure<\/a>, which currently totals a fan base of 103K. Mainly known for her understated style and penchant for mixing thrifted goods with&nbsp;small-brand names, Blutstein's ensembles are coveted but attainable, which is just one reason why we're so obsessed with her. (We even named her one of the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2016/12/fashion-social-media-influencers-to-watch-2017\">18 fashion influencers to watch in 2017<\/a>.)<\/p><p>We hopped on the phone with Blutstein, who's based in Atlanta, to learn more about her love of thrifting, her favorite&nbsp;labels at the moment&nbsp;and planning outfits for her Instagram account. (And then, while she was visiting New York City, we took a stroll with her in Soho&nbsp;for this fun shoot.)<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci02065943c00026cd\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Reese Blutstein wearing The Arrivals coat, The Frankie Shop sweater, Nanushka pants, Reike Nen boots, Gucci glasses and a Sonya Lee purse. Photo: Whitney Bauck/Fashionista\"><\/div><p>\"In middle school, my mom gave me $30 to shop for something and I went to <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/neiman-marcus\">Neiman Marcus<\/a> to buy a little bottle of gold <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/coco-chanel\">Coco Chanel<\/a> nail polish. My mom was like, 'Are you sure you want to spend $30 on this?' and I was very sure. That's one shopping memory that I remember the most.&nbsp;<\/p><p>My shopping habits now involve a lot of thrifting, which started during high school mostly because I didn't have any money but I wanted different clothes to wear to school. I love going to Goodwill and we have antique shops, like Highland Row Antiques, that have really cool clothes but are more expensive. We have this giant warehouse, called Last Chance; it's huge and kind of overwhelming. Whenever I go, I always have something in mind because it's really hard if you don't. I go into thrift stores and I try to look at everything. If you skim over stuff, you'll miss something good.&nbsp;<\/p><p>I feel like I don't shop that much online, but when I do, I like <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/need-supply\">Need Supply<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/asos\">ASOS<\/a>. I don't buy that many things, either. I try to buy things that I know I can wear multiple ways. Let's say it's a pair of pants, I'll make sure I can dress it five different ways. I don't like how on Instagram, you wear it one time only, or I can only wear it one way. If you really like something and can style it a couple different ways, then I feel like you should buy it.&nbsp;<\/p><p>I follow so many people on Instagram. I think that's where most people get inspiration. I always look at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alwaysjudging/\">@alwaysjudging<\/a>. She's amazing; her photos kill me every time I look at them. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lifeofboheme/\">@lifeofboheme<\/a>, Marta, is really really cool, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alyssainthecity/\">@alyssainthecity<\/a> is adorable.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci02065944400026cd\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Reese Blutstein in Soho, New York. Photo: Whitney Bauck/Fashionista\"><\/div><p>I find a lot of small brands on Instagram, definitely. I'll see someone like something, and then I'll see that person in something and it goes down the list from there. I'll have companies I've never heard of email me and if I like it then I'm like, 'Oh wow, I’m so glad I know about them.' LOQ shoes approached me when I had a small following. Every single shoe that comes out, I'm obsessed. Other brands that I'm really into right now are Jesse Kamm — her sailor pants, I love them; Paloma Wool, <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/collina-strada\">Collina Strada<\/a>, Nanushka from Budapest and shoes from Grey Matters.<\/p><p>I guess my closet is more jam-packed now, but I feel like I don't have that many clothes compared to a lot of people. It definitely has grown since I have people send me stuff. One week I'll get a few, maybe three packages, and some weeks I'll get seven. But I'm not going to wear something that I kind of like or because I'm getting it for free. I have to genuinely like it. You've already worked on a trust with your followers. If you're posting things for an ad or just because you were given it for free, then no one can trust you.&nbsp;<\/p><p>My personal style is never the same. Some days I dress more girlie and some days I dress more masculine. But I guess I always wear the same types of clothes, like wide-leg pants, so I guess that's a style I always have. But I constantly change what I wear because I don't want to stick to one thing and have that be my style because then you can't really branch out. I'm trying to work a button-down lately. I like to wear it in different ways but wearing it normally is what I always have a hard time with. For things I can't pull off I try really hard so that I actually can wear it.<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci02065942100126b7\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Reese Blutstein in Soho, New York. Photo: Whitney Bauck/Fashionista\"><\/div><p>On Instagram, I do not plan my outfit posts out at all. On Tuesday and Thursday I go to school for most of the day, then I wait for my boyfriend, who takes my pictures, to be done with work. There are certain places in Atlanta that I like to take pictures and during the week, we have really bad traffic, so I try to plan outfits and take a picture really quickly.&nbsp;<\/p><p>I probably take about 40 pictures at a time. I just constantly move and keep taking them. I usually like the in-between photos of me moving. Then I post on Instagram within the hour. I do it every single day and it's usually what I wore or what I came up with right then. It's very not planned out!<\/p><p>I definitely think about how clothes will appear in photos when I go shopping. You can pose a certain way to always make something look good on the camera, but you want it to actually look good in real life, too.&nbsp;<\/p><p>I'm mostly drawn to patterns, textures or colors people are wearing than certain pieces, if that makes sense. It's not really like, 'I like that shirt.' But I do want some&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/celine\">Céline<\/a>&nbsp;shoes. They're ballerina flats with a thick heel. They've been around for a while and I've always wanted them, but I can't afford it so it's always on my radar.

There's not much&nbsp;about choking down several&nbsp;hulking, ambiguously effective pills on a daily basis&nbsp;that's inherently appealing. That's not to mention the mundane process of shopping for them — whether it it involves scrolling through a series of sketchy-looking pages on Amazon or staring at a drugstore aisle full of outright ugly brown and yellow bottles. Given that&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/vitamins\">vitamin<\/a> industry is relatively unregulated, it's also hard to know for sure what ingredients are in any given supplement, not to mention whether those ingredients are effectively absorbed or efficacious in any way. But it's 2017, and consumers are becoming increasingly willing to shell out cash for items that contribute to notions of&nbsp;self-care and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/wellness\">wellness<\/a>. With that — and the fact that the vitamin and dietary supplement market <a href=\"http://www.euromonitor.com/vitamins-and-dietary-supplements-in-the-us/report\">is on an upward trend<\/a> — in mind, a crop of new direct-to-consumer startups have arrived.

I felt like a real opportunity to create something delightful that can impact people's health.\"&nbsp;Elbert has a&nbsp;background in&nbsp;the direct-to-consumer fashion business, having held several positions at menswear company <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/bonobos\">Bonobos<\/a> between 2009 and 2015, most recently serving as vice president of marketing before leaving to create Care/of. He drew on his experience with men's fashion when thinking about how to approach the wellness industry, launching Care/of (along with co-founder Akash Shah) in November 2016. \"What we thought a lot about at Bonobos was how you create delightful customer experiences in a stagnant category. In that case, it was men's khaki pants — there's really nothing more boring than men's khaki pants,\" he says.&nbsp;<\/p><p>With Care/of, Elbert&nbsp;is hoping to bring the same&nbsp;streamlined, user-friendly shopping experience (and a more pleasant, appealing product) to pill popping. In addition to being effective and safe, says Elbert, vitamins should be enjoyable — a quality&nbsp;he says the industry at large was mostly neglecting. \"The products that we have in our lives should look nice. They should talk to us, they should be a reflection of who we are. When I looked at this category, you either had something oversimplified, like a green bottle with someone doing yoga and put a leaf on it, and that's the extent of the marketing; or it would be chrome tubs marketed to bros. There was no nuance,\" he explains, also stressing the importance of having a direct dialogue with customers.&nbsp;\"It's really important to have an authentic voice, versus just a walled-off, cold, distant tone, which I think is historically [what supplement brands have had].\"&nbsp;<\/p><p>Care/of builds that notion of authentic communication and personalization right into the shopping experience. Users begin by answering a series of questions about their&nbsp;health and wellness priorities, which span the categories of \"brain,\" \"heart,\" \"immunity,\" \"skin,\" \"digestion,\" \"stress\" and \"bones.\" The survey also allows you to factor in lifestyle and diet in order to determine which supplements are recommended. And those supplement formulas weren't just haphazardly concocted. \"The credibility is super important, and I think that's something that's different from fashion in this category,\" says Elbert. \"First we had to start knowing we had a great product and knowing the right recommendations [for different people], so we started by working with doctors at Harvard to make sure we had research behind everything. Ultimately the product is something people put in their bodies, and they're taking it to live healthier lives.\"<\/p><p>While vitamins can typically run the gamut in terms of price point (often skewing toward $15-20 or more for a month's supply), Care/of's formulas were developed to be accessible. Depending on the supplement, each capsule retails for between $5 and $25 for a 30-day supply. (The $25 supplement is the brand's prenatal formula.)<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BQ5TtTMAAQc\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ5TtTMAAQc\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/16906945_1343141975724511_6931527537239523328_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Once the personalization process is complete, users can determine which of the suggested supplements they do, in fact, want to purchase, and then their final selections are packaged into separate foil pouches meant to be taken daily (one shipment includes a 30-day supply, but you can also purchase various supplements a la carte). Care/of's design team drew inspiration from fashion, beauty and wellness brands when creating said packaging, aiming for a modern look that's not stuffy or overly serious — Elbert mentioned&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/ayr\">AYR<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/outdoor-voices\">Outdoor Voices<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/glossier\">Glossier<\/a>&nbsp;as points of inspiration.<\/p><p>So far, Elbert has been pleased with the way&nbsp;consumers have responded. \"It's been really fun to watch the customer base grow — we're about a 50/50 split between men and women, and honestly, I thought it would skew more toward women. In the industry, women often still drive the conversation around nutrition within households, so they're the ones who are doing the purchasing and research,\" he says. \"The overall reaction has been really positive — we've seen a lot of love on social media when people receive their boxes.\"&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BQ0a8rxl9Ks\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0a8rxl9Ks\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/16788522_772926849541217_775276257314078720_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Another startup looking to change the supplements business is Ritual, a Los Angeles-based company founded by Katerina Schneider in October 2016. A subscription-based brand that sells a single product — a multivitamin specifically formulated for women's nutritional needs — Ritual's roots are similar to those of Care/of. When Schneider, whose background is in venture capital, became pregnant, she turned a skeptical eye toward the products she was using and the ingredients in them. \"I started clearing everything in my house to avoid harmful ingredients, and one day, I started to look at the prenatal vitamins I was taking every day and realized that some of the ingredients I was avoiding around the house were in the vitamins I was taking every day. I was shocked,\" she says. \"I called friends trying to find a better vitamin and asked what brands they'd been taking for years and for their pregnancies, and in general, people couldn't remember the brand of vitamins they'd been taking.\" Schneider saw that lack of brand recognition as an opportunity. \"I decided to leave my job and take a risk and start a company that was going to reinvent the vitamin from the ground up.\"<\/p><p>Affordability is a&nbsp;tentpole of Ritual's business; the 30-day supply of supplements costs $30, and the brand drives home that \"dollar a day\" point in its marketing. But the first priority for Schneider was to come up with what she sees as a truly revolutionary product in the category.&nbsp;\"I spent over a year just meeting with scientists and doctors, figuring out what it is that women actually need — do we even need vitamins? — and then once it turned out that we do, there are nine essential nutrients that women actually needed,\" says Schneider. The next step was to combine those nutrients into a single capsule that could effectively supplement the nutrients many women miss out on in their diets. \"We worked with the leading company to come up with our encapsulation system, which is different from anything else out there. We figured out a way of encapsulating dry ingredients and oil ingredients into one capsule,\" she says. And the resulting pill, as it turned out, looked a hell of a lot prettier than most other vitamins. \"Form follows function — we were trying to solve for [having to take] fewer vitamins and keeping them in a form that the body actually uses, and we ended up with something that was also visually stunning. The effect is kind of like a snow globe.\"&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BQDfET_BpGW\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQDfET_BpGW\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/16465262_380134562366089_6030922162838175744_n.jpg\"><\/div><p>Like Care/of, Ritual hopes to connect with consumers via social media and a refreshingly upbeat, cool-kid visual persona. \"Most of us are millennial women designing the branding and marketing behind it, so we wanted to design a product we wanted to take,\" says Schneider.<\/p><p>Schneider has noticed that people in the fashion and beauty industries seem especially drawn to Ritual, which perhaps&nbsp;owes to its aesthetic appeal. \"We're seeing a lot of fashion and beauty bloggers and influencers posting our vitamin in their weekend bags or next to their cute shoes,\" she says. In addition to perfecting the formula and the visuals, Ritual hopes to grow its business by fostering a community with its customers. \"We're focused on building a cult-like following,\"&nbsp;says Schneider. \"And with the subscription model, we can put cute calendars and stickers into the boxes, which allows us to get people to remember to take their vitamins — it's really important, and that hasn't been done before.\"<\/p><p>While both Care/of and Ritual are still in their infancy, their timing is apt. According to <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/health-wellness.html\">a 2016 survey<\/a>&nbsp;by Deloitte's Consumer Goods Forum, consumers are prioritizing health and wellness more than ever, and&nbsp;value companies founded on transparency and facts. So the accessibility and openness both vitamin startups are aiming to establish — combined with their clear messaging, appealing branding and an emphasis on community building — could be just what people are looking for right now. This cultural moment is not lost on Elbert.&nbsp;\"If you look from a macro level of where things were at in the '80s and '90s, with so much processed food and an obesity epidemic within the country, there's been a lot more of a conscious effort to start taking care of ourselves,\" he says. \"It's become&nbsp;cool and relevant [to focus on wellness]. People are gradually understanding the impact of what they're doing and how it impacts how they feel, and I think that's a trend that will continue for a while.\"<\/p><p><em>Homepage photo: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BOsH2VqhmGa/?taken-by=ritual\">@ritual/Instagram<\/a><\/em><\/p><p><em><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\">Sign up for our daily newsletter and get the latest industry news in your inbox every day.&nbsp;<\/a><\/em><\/p>","primarySectionIds":["ci020b90f5100124c1"],"primaryImageId":"ci02049ed8a0002711","path":"/2017/03/best-startup-vitamins-benefits","associatedRichTerms":[{"$ref":"ci01cde2ebf000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6b55c0002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cd737a900099de"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6cff00002a83"},{"$ref":"ci02049ee440002637"},{"$ref":"ci01dc0fec6000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci020b90f5100124c1"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6a864000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cd6a860000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01d135fca00099de"}],"socialPopularity":136,"featuredMediaId":"ci02049ed0d0002637","slug":"best-startup-vitamins-benefits","contentNodeId":"cn02049dd280002637","authorProfile":{"$ref":"ci01ee8850900026f3"},"teaser":"A closer look at two companies poised to become the Warby Parkers of the supplement world.","promoTitle":"","socialStats":{"reddit":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"pinterest":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":4.77654,"lastCount":4},"twitter":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"googleplus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":0,"lastCount":0},"linkedin":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":3.92732,"lastCount":3},"facebook":{"acceleration":3.00358e-13,"velocity":4.97713e-7,"estimate":129.307,"lastCount":128},"disqus":{"acceleration":0,"velocity":0,"estimate":1.46923,"lastCount":1}},"dek":"A closer look at two fashionable companies poised to become the Warby Parkers of the supplement world.","featuredMedia":{"height":697,"cloudinaryVersionId":1488400524,"id":"ci02049ed0d0002637","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"ritual-vitamin","primaryPhotoId":"ci02049ed0d0002637","hasFaces":false,"width":1080,"publicId":"MTQ1NDE1NzA3Mzk0MzIwMTQ1","format":"jpg","bytes":74777}},{"authorProfileId":"ci01ee8850900026f3","isInstantArticle":false,"publicationTimestamp":"2017-03-06T14:30:00Z","sectionIds":[["ci020b90f5100124c1"]],"isExcludedFromPublishedStreams":false,"commentsEnabled":true,"id":"ci0204c239f0002637","objectType":"ContentArticle","terms":[{"$ref":"ci01cd6a864000efe2"},{"$ref":"ci01cd50db30002a83"},{"$ref":"ci01cd3af20000c80a"},{"$ref":"ci01e204ee4000efe2"}],"isNoindex":false,"title":"Subversive New Beauty Blog Beauty Dummy Wants to Be Your Best Friend","primaryImage":{"height":526,"cloudinaryVersionId":1488555794,"id":"ci0204c4b930002711","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"beauty-dummy-promo","primaryPhotoId":"ci0204c4b930002711","hasFaces":true,"width":933,"publicId":"MTQ1NDU3Mzg3MzY3NTczMjY1","format":"jpg","bytes":596022},"editedTimestamp":"2017-03-06T14:43:37Z","disqusId":"4cb06b46-0010-11e7-a7a8-02d9a4cbd131","autoSaved":false,"tmlEmbeds":[{"height":531,"cloudinaryVersionId":1488558442,"id":"ci0204c55eb0002637","objectType":"ContentPhoto","title":"beauty-dummy-founders","primaryPhotoId":"ci0204c55eb0002637","hasFaces":true,"width":800,"publicId":"MTQ1NDU4MDk4MTg0NjYwNTM1","format":"jpg","bytes":58895}],"bodyTml":"<!-- tml-version=\"2\" --><p>When asked what's&nbsp;been missing from the beauty conversation, Kathryn Margaret Rose and Hannah Faulkner, the duo behind a new beauty blog called <a href=\"https://www.beautydummy.com/\">Beauty Dummy<\/a>, don't mince their words. \"Humor and inclusivity,\" says Rose; as a comedian, she would know. \"Also, there's too much advertising and not enough honesty,\" adds Faulkner, who works full-time as a hairstylist in Manhattan. Longtime friends who grew up together in North Carolina and then moved to New York City together in 2012, the pair grew frustrated by what they saw as narrow, uptight, self-important beauty content on the internet — so they decided to do something about it by launching their own site, which officially went live on Monday morning.<\/p><p>\"The idea for Beauty Dummy came when we realized, even with thousands of magazines, beauty sites and blogs, we couldn't find one we felt represented us, and the different voices, body types, racial and gender identities that make up our social group,\" says Rose. \"We wanted to create a place for folks who don't fit the mold of the typical 'It' girl, and aren't trying to.\" With that in mind, Beauty Dummy seeks to cater to a diverse audience and to approach the concept of beauty with an open mind. \"Not everyone who loves makeup is a straight, white, rich, thin woman, and we think there should be room for everyone. After all, breaking barriers and trying new things is what drew us to beauty in the first place,\" she says.<\/p><p>As is clear from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/beautydummy/\">the Instagram feed<\/a> they launched just over a month ago to tease the site's launch, Rose and Faulkner have a clear vision and aesthetic for the site. Cheerful, witty and inclusive, the brand they're cultivating has a freshness the industry could benefit from right now. \"The site will be a mix of photo shoots, tutorials, videos and reviews, [and will] feature a diverse group of innovators and up-and-comers from New York and beyond,\" says Rose. \"With Hannah's expertise and my comedy background, the voice will not only be informative, but fun, casual and cool. Think hanging out with your best friend — to put it in 'Mean Girls' terms: If most beauty blogs are The Plastics, we want to be Janis and Damian.\"<\/p><p>Fashionista caught up with the pair ahead of&nbsp;Beauty Dummy's launch to discuss finding inspiration from \"Clarissa Explains It All,\"&nbsp;the importance of seeing diversity as more than just a box to check and why this cultural moment&nbsp;seems like the perfect time to be launching a chill beauty blog.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0204c55eb0002637\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Hannah Faulkner and Kathryn Margaret Rose. Photo: Courtesy of Hannah Faulkner and Kathryn Margaret Rose\"><\/div><p><strong>Tell me about yourselves and how you started working together.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Hannah: <\/strong>I've always been very into makeup and playing with my appearance. I went to beauty school right after high school as a way to make money and ended up falling in love with it. It kind of came naturally to me since I'm a visual artist. Cutting hair is like making a sculpture.<\/p><p><strong>Kathryn:<\/strong> Hannah and I met in our hometown of Raleigh, North Carolina. We had mutual friends and I was a bit of a chameleon — never wanted to have the same look for long. She started coloring my hair in the bathtub of her apartment, and we've been close ever since. This was almost 10 years ago. <\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>Part of what I really enjoy about this industry is educating people and giving them information they wouldn't have access to without a gateway. The beauty realm as it is now is somewhat secretive, putting the stylist on a pedestal. I prefer to share ideas with people on a more personal level. That's just always been my style. <\/p><p><strong>Why did you decide to start Beauty Dummy?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>I studied film and writing in college and after graduation was just looking for a way to express my overflowing opinions on... everything. That's when I started blogging and doing comedy. Hannah and I both moved to New York in 2012, and after taking multiple unpaid internships, I was desperate for money. Since Hannah was working as a hairdresser, she got me a job in management at a salon. I found it fascinating.<\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>Working together, we were constantly talking about beauty and hair, and then we'd get dressed up and go party. <\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>We noticed the way people talk about beauty on the internet is so different than the way we talk about it in real life.<\/p><p><strong>What's your vision for Beauty Dummy, and who do you hope will read it?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>Our main goal with Beauty Dummy is to be inclusive and accessible. As a hairdresser, I've always found it weird that our industry has so many \"secrets\"&nbsp;that the average person doesn't know. We speak in an entirely different language, and it shouldn't have to be that way. <\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>As a comedian and all-around goofball, I find myself looking at beauty blogs like, \"Why so serious?\" Beauty for me is all about play. It's about feeling good with your friends and experimenting with a fearlessness you have around the people who know you the best. We want our readers to feel that comfortable with us. <\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>We're not really trying to appeal to any specific type of person. Maybe it's a huge task, but we want to be the kind of beauty blog that can appeal to everyone. If you have skin and hair on your body, you're who we're looking for. <\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>We're hoping our readers will end up looking like our group of friends: diverse in race, cultural background, sexualities, gender identities and hair and body types, and open-minded. We may be two more white women in the beauty blogosphere, but that's not what our world looks like.<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BQa-bvzF8o8\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BQa-bvzF8o8\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/16583264_713661185460648_4736390342327140352_n.jpg\"><\/div><p><strong>How did you come up with the name and aesthetic for the site?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>K:<\/strong> We really wanted to come up with a name that represented our playful approach to beauty. Also, I don't know nearly as much about beauty as Hannah does. I kind of just fuck around until I get it right. You could say I'm the \"dummy.\"<\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>I don't know about that. You were pretty handy at cutting your hair with safety scissors when I first met you. There's also the pun of a \"dummy\" being a test subject or a mannequin. <\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>Except we're like... really loud. In terms of aesthetics, we're still obsessed with Tumblr even though it's an Instagram world these days. We've found a lot of inspiration there. <\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>Part of why we chose our colors and aesthetic is that it's calm and relaxing, but still bold and not overly \"feminine.\" It's reflective of our personal styles. <\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>Girlie, streamlined, but not afraid to take up space. A lot of awesome brands are playing with minimalism and femininity in a cool way right now, design-wise.  <\/p><p><strong>Were there any other brands you were inspired by when you were thinking about the design?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong><a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/glossier\">Glossier<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/thinx\">Thinx<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>Media sites like <em><a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/nylon\">Nylon<\/a><\/em> and Broadly.

Why does it have to be a rarity to see trans folks or people of color in the mainstream beauty conversation? It's time for the beauty industry to be more accessible. We want to be part of that movement.<\/p><p><strong>Why was now the right moment for you to launch Beauty Dummy? Was there something about this time in history or just the cultural moment we're experiencing that made you decide to make this happen?<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>K: <\/strong>You can't deny that safe, inclusive spaces are harder to come by these days with our current government situation.&nbsp;[The Trump administration has potential to] cause harm to women, people of color, the LGBTQ community, immigrants and generally everyone we think makes America amazing.<\/p><p><strong>H: <\/strong>That said, we weren't seeing equal rights or representation even before the election.

in the fashion and beauty industries about how they broke in and found success.<\/em><\/p><p>Yes, <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/hrush-achemyan\">Hrush Achemyan<\/a>&nbsp;is known as one of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's go-to makeup artists. (See:&nbsp;Kim's recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BPbpXuhFKW3/?taken-by=styledbyhrush&amp;hl=en\">barely there, lip-ring-enhancing look<\/a> for lunch with hubby Kanye West,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BE84HQaMJ6b/?hl=en\">Kendall's tech-themed Met Gala outing<\/a> last year and multiple <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/kylie-cosmetics\">Kylie Cosmetics<\/a>&nbsp;campaigns, including the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BN7P4Nkj-E7/\">Love Bite<\/a>.) But she's an established brand in her own right — name:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.styledbyhrush.com/\">Styled by Hrush<\/a> — boasting&nbsp;1.8 million&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/styledbyhrush/\">Instagram<\/a> followers and counting, collaborating with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/tarte\">Tarte Cosmetics<\/a> on a limited-edition palette&nbsp;and teaching aspiring MUAs her craft via globe-spanning beauty tours.&nbsp;<\/p><p>However, Achemyan didn't&nbsp;train in cosmetology&nbsp;or begin by&nbsp;assisting a more&nbsp;experienced makeup artist. Her career advancement involved&nbsp;a mix of scrappiness, long hours,&nbsp;a little right-place-at-the-right-time fortune and of course, strategic use of good old&nbsp;Instagram.&nbsp;Achemyan&nbsp;actually began her career in fashion, with an internship under Karoza, a <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/bridal\">bridal<\/a> designer in Los Angeles. There,&nbsp;the owner helped her&nbsp;realize her underlying interest and&nbsp;aspirations,&nbsp;influenced by an artist&nbsp;uncle and oil painting, her hobby of choice.<\/p><p>\"'I&nbsp;would ask you to sketch designs, [but] you pay more attention to the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/highlighting\">highlighting<\/a> and <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/tag/contouring\">contouring<\/a> on the face of the image, versus the clothing,'\" laughs&nbsp;Achemyan, as&nbsp;she imitates the designer.&nbsp;\"[He said], 'maybe you should try makeup.'\" Her boss also played a fairy godparent role in securing her first official gig. When a bridal&nbsp;client's makeup artist canceled at the last minute, he immediately volunteered his 17-year-old intern for the job.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0201d29600002626\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"Makeup artist Hrush Achemyan. Photo: Levon Muradian\"><\/div><p>\"He basically had someone go get a makeup kit, and said, 'this is your chance. I want you to do her makeup,'\" she says. \"My hands shook the whole time. I cried afterward.\"&nbsp;The bride was thrilled with the newly minted makeup artist's&nbsp;technique. \"I basically manipulate makeup the same way I manipulate oil paints to make it last for 10 hours,\"&nbsp;she&nbsp;explains. (The secret: \"You have to let a color dry before you apply another texture or another color.\" Huh.)&nbsp;And from there, it was all word of mouth. \"[The bride]&nbsp;referred me to 20 people, and then those 20 people&nbsp;referred me.\" At that point,&nbsp;Achemyan&nbsp;began her career in bridal, which led to a life-changing opportunity&nbsp;to become a&nbsp;<em>celebrity<\/em> makeup artist.<\/p><p>\"The first celebrity client I had was <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/designers/kim-kardashian\">Kim Kardashian<\/a>, which is pretty insane, because&nbsp;it was jumping from having zero celebrity clients to the biggest and highest authority in glam,\" says Achemyan. About two and a half years ago, Kardashian first saw the LA-based makeup artist's work in person at an event. Then, being the savvy marketer that she is, Kardashian conducted her due diligence by inspecting&nbsp;Achemyan's Instagram page and was pleased with the visuals. \"[Kardashian] definitely stated there was a social media aspect [involved in hiring me],\" says&nbsp;Achemyan. \"[She said], 'when I looked at your page, it was just what I was looking for.'\"&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BNOigLzlu3G\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BNOigLzlu3G\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/14624607_162764110863047_1192573269748744192_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTM5MTIwMTA4MDE4NTM4NDM5MA%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>Today, she&nbsp;works with every Kardashian-Jenner sister — Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie <em>and<\/em> Kendall — all of whom fully understand&nbsp;the benefits of having an active and deliberate&nbsp;social media presence. And their makeup artist knows how important that tool is for her career, too. \"Social media should definitely be manipulated and used for whatever it is that you're trying to push, whether it's fashion, fitness or beauty,\"&nbsp;Achemyan&nbsp;says. \"As long as you're producing unique images that somebody is inspired by, you'll draw followers; you'll draw attention to your account.\"<\/p><p>Of course, she recognizes that having famous clients&nbsp;is also a plus because they credit her on <em>their<\/em> social media feeds. \"I definitely think it's a really big bonus for anyone that does celebrities, not just me,\" Achemyan says. \"These clients&nbsp;help you <em>create<\/em> trends because they are such famous faces that your work is put on a bigger pedestal.\" She references&nbsp;a time she showcased a lip contouring technique,&nbsp;involving lining a notable&nbsp;client's lips with&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark liquid&nbsp;color to create a fuller effect, which&nbsp;blew up from there.<\/p><p>But there's a fine line to walk when it comes to being well-known as a big celebrity's makeup artist. \"A lot of people&nbsp;get cornered [when] they only do one person's makeup,\"&nbsp;Achemyan&nbsp;says. \"I just think that you just have to keep doing different faces and just post different images [on social media], as well. You can't ride someone else's bandwagon. They worked hard to get where they are. You can't just ride off of their coattails.\"<\/p><div tml-image=\"ci0201d295f0002626\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-image-caption=\"The Styled by Hrush x Tarte palette. Photo: courtesy\"><\/div><p>She makes a point to work with a mix of clientele, including \"regular,\" non-paparazzi-stalked \"canvases\" to diversify and continue improving her craft.&nbsp;Achemyan&nbsp;also expanded her own brand portfolio by collaborating last year with Tarte Cosmetics on a sexy eye-and-cheek palette bearing her brand name, Styled by Hrush, which sold out multiple rounds (and is now available on <a href=\"http://www.ulta.com/styled-by-hrush-eye-cheek-palette?productId=xlsImpprod14291025\">Ulta<\/a>). Tarte, a brand which supported her early on in her pre-influencer career, gave her \"full-on creative freedom to control the shades, the formula, the design concept, the images and the photo shoots.\"<\/p><p>Four years ago, Achemyan also started touring and teaching makeup classes to aspiring makeup artists, a concept that Kardashian-Jenner hairstylist and <em>Mane Addicts<\/em> founder <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2014/12/jen-atkin-interview\">Jen Atkin<\/a> embraces for hair. Most recently, she jetted to fashion and beauty hotspot Dubai&nbsp;for the Make Up Forever Brow Show. She finds motivation in providing education to people starting out in the business because&nbsp;she didn't have formal training of her own.&nbsp;\"It just makes me so happy because it makes me feel like I'm leaving a legacy behind,\" she says.&nbsp;<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BN54l__lHYs\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BN54l__lHYs\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/15258917_1702826586675910_3406323538661998592_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQwMzQwMTY2MDg0MDMxMDMxNg%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>Achemyan also speaks about the power of cultivating a brand and beauty #aesthetic via social media during her presentations to fledgling MUAs. \"I always preach how important it is to visually stimulate people that are viewing your page — and really showing your work in the best light you possibly can — because you never know who's looking,\" she says.<\/p><p>Plus, Achemyan recognizes the opportunities that stem from becoming your own brand as a makeup artist. \"I feel like makeup artists have become influencers,\" she says. \"They are the new trendsetters of what's in and what's not. That has to be the coolest thing that social media has definitely done for a lot of makeup artists. It's amazing. If we post something, the product sells out.\" (It's worth noting that Achemyan does make a point to differentiate to her followers what products she actually uses on the job and what&nbsp;she's just \"unboxing\" via Snapchat.)<\/p><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BPbpXuhFKW3\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BPbpXuhFKW3\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/16110858_777576019074986_7949463107405873152_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQzMDkxOTI1NzAyMjMwOTgxNQ%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>Since we had the beauty influencer and Kardashian-whisperer on the phone, we figured we'd take the time to also find out what the next big beauty trend she's predicting (or setting) for the year will be.\"Two thousand seventeen&nbsp;is going to be about the bold brow, the dewy skin, the no-makeup, makeup look,\"&nbsp;Achemyan&nbsp;says. \"You will see a lot more people just calming down on the glam. I feel like it's a nice change because I see so many 14-year-olds with a full face and there's a time and place for everything. It's not about less contouring and less highlighting. It's just going to be  a more minimal level of everything that you've been seeing. Everything can still be applied, but just a <em>smaller<\/em> amount.\"&nbsp;<\/p><p><em><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\">Want the latest fashion industry news first?

But, for some of us, the real kicker is that we don't enjoy it nearly enough for the amount of effort we're exerting.&nbsp;<\/p><p>We held an internal roundtable and seven of our editors sounded off on all of the above. (Spoiler: It's not all bad! Some of us have gained valuable perspective on Instagram that could restore some fun into your own&nbsp;experience.) Do you agree with our sentiments? Are we just being dramatic? Should we all quit social media completely and move to a commune in Colorado?

While he understands the competitive, image-driven nature of my business and the fact that my Instagram page is both an extension of my resume and a reflection of my aesthetic, I&nbsp;see him die a little inside when I declare that it's \"content time.\" In those tense moments, he must take on an important, thankless role that he&nbsp;never asked for when we exchanged vows: that of the Instagram Husband. <\/p><p>The maintenance of my Instagram feed is one of the most anxiety-inducing aspects of my job. At the beginning, the app was so much fun! I snapped random scenes from my day-to-day NYC existence and of anything that made me smile — a promo poster for \"Drive\" featuring Ryan Gosling, for example — adding an \"artsy\" touch with the bold&nbsp;filters that were standard in Instagram's early days. There was little rhyme or reason behind my posts, with the only common thread being, \"I like these things, maybe you will, too.\"<\/p><p>But as the years went by and brands, modeling agencies and PRs&nbsp;caught on, the platform became all about strategy. Bloggers, editors and tastemakers rose to industry fame by posting perfectly filtered \"outfit of the day\" photos, and if these caught enough eyes in high places, they'd receive free product for a following post — or, even get paid a premium to wear it. (Ah, the dawn of the influencer!) As a camera-shy, behind-the-scenes type&nbsp;who&nbsp;can't afford to shop for high-end Insta-bait every season, it can feel impossible to compete with those who, for myriad reasons, are dripping in it. <\/p><p>Have I considered buying something&nbsp;because I thought it'd photograph well for&nbsp;Instagram? Sadly, yes. In addition, I've agonized over my physical appearance — fearing that I'll \"never measure up\" — in ways that I never had before the app entered my life in 2010. But perhaps the worst psychological effect Instagram's had on me is the looming implication that poor \"performance\" on the network will damage my career. <\/p><p>During a boozy dinner a couple of years ago, a top fashion publicist told me, in so many words, that I was, in fact, doing myself a disservice by not trying to become an Instagram personality. At another, slightly boozier dinner recently, a PR confessed that Fashionista wasn't included on a particular press trip because invitations were largely based on editors' follower counts. To hear that a well-crafted story about the opportunity was worth significantly less than pretty, pretty Instagram content was a blow to say the least; I'd be lying if I said that I don't worry that my lack of social media fame will negatively impact my future job prospects. (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssavingan/status/765929115094511617\">And I know I am not alone here.<\/a>)<\/p><p>So, there you have it. I'll probably never be the face of a publication or a brand with a personal following in the hundreds of thousands, but if you ever need a #content machine of the non-social media variety, I'm your girl.<\/p><h3>Dhani Mau, Editorial Director<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BO3YY1iDd0o\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BO3YY1iDd0o\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/15876935_434530106937743_5509698654216126464_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQyMDcxMTQ2NzMyMjAzOTU5Mg%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>When I started working at Fashionista, I don't think we even had an official Twitter account, so the concept of social media as a necessary complement to publishing is something I had to get used to over time —&nbsp;and I can't say it's come naturally to me. Maybe I have some self-confidence issues, but the idea that anyone cares even remotely about what I ate for breakfast or what my feelings are about some TV show or magazine cover still makes no sense to me, so Twitter has never been my thing. Communicating visually through Instagram, however, was something I could relate to a little bit more, and I do get to see some pretty cool stuff in my life, from my cat to Paris Fashion Week, that's worth sharing. But like my fellow co-editors, I find myself hesitating more and more about what I post lately. And the less I post, the more I feel like what I <em>do<\/em> post has to be \"really good\" somehow and then I want to slap myself for caring so much about something so trivial — or at least that should be trivial.<\/p><p>I recently read the dystopian book \"The Circle,\"&nbsp;in which the main character (and most of society) becomes consumed by her social media persona — literally conflating her own self worth with online engagement. It doesn't end well and left me feeling kinda sick and terrified for the future because it wasn't so far from reality. It's a similar sensation to the one I feel when I hear that someone gets passed up for an  opportunity because of their Instagram presence despite being otherwise qualified. It's an environment that leads to people doing and posting things solely for social media, and thus being inauthentic by definition, which is kinda crazy!&nbsp;<\/p><p>I don't think I could really live with myself if I succumbed to that and I think I would start to get really confused about what my Instagram personality is vs. my real one — and tbh, figuring that out in your 20s is already difficult enough. I can only hope that, for some people, the \"real\" stuff I do — like make content for this site and attempt to be a decent human being — is enough. And if not, I guess I'm moving to a farm.<\/p><h3>Tyler McCall, Deputy Editor<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BON_dvchNTa\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BON_dvchNTa\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/15538411_1706150149699905_7308368573380952064_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQwOTA2MTM3OTE3NjE5MTE5NA%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>I have a real love/hate relationship with Instagram. I genuinely love using it as an exploration tool, and I've found fun news stories by combing through my&nbsp;feed. <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2013/08/anna-dello-russo-works-out-in-dolce-gabbana-runway-looks\">Anna Dello Russo jogging in a full Dolce &amp; Gabbana look<\/a> is internet gold, people! I also really enjoy seeing everyone's far-flung trips, extravagant purchases&nbsp;and best selfies.<\/p><p>But the flip side is that it's definitely&nbsp;made me feel like I have to keep up with the Joneses, so to speak. It seems like the more Instagram followers you have, the more respect you get from people in the industry — and the more opportunities you have. That might not be true, but I'm still trying to get in the game. I recently downloaded an app that will generate the most popular hashtags for the type of image you're Instagramming. It makes me feel like an enormous asshole, but it works. I mean, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BNNF-27hldn/?taken-by=eiffeltyler\">I did a flatlay on Thanksgiving<\/a>, for God's sake.<\/p><p>Still, I try to reel it in when I&nbsp;feel that I'm trying too hard. I want to just be my realest self on Instagram — okay, a highly-filtered real version of myself.<\/p><h3>Maura Brannigan, Senior Editor<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BJqRXjQBPkn\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJqRXjQBPkn\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/14052687_1161748713868262_1139430172_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTMyNjk0OTQyNTQwMjQxMTMwMw%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>Recently, I scrolled back&nbsp;to my very first post on Instagram from November 2011. The picture had been run through roughly 800 filters and had a tacky, feathered film border around the edges. I narcissistically went to delete it out of panic&nbsp;—&nbsp;my lord, had I used KELVIN?!&nbsp;—&nbsp;but instead resorted to researching \"how to delete Instagram photos in bulk\" for the rest of the evening. Later, in bed, I caught myself dozing off with my phone in-hand, the screen glowing with the Instagram feed of a C-list Bachelor contestant.<\/p><p>I woke up the next morning feeling like I had snapped. I considered downloading one of those trackers that tells you how many hours of This One Precious Life you're&nbsp;wasting on apps, but was admittedly afraid to see my paranoia first calculated, then spelled out in some cute, sans-serif typeface. I logged out of Instagram for the rest of the day and didn't miss it one bit. I even thought about deleting it altogether.<\/p><p>The thing that kills me about my whole Instagram complex is that I'm not even good at it! My feed isn't pretty or funny or unfiltered or, frankly, entertaining. It's just <em>there<\/em>, floating in cyberspace with whatever VSCO setting I've adopted. I get that we're \"supposed\" to have \"brands\" that are \"distinct\" to each respective platform, but is Instagram supposed to be this much work? It's meant to look easy and consistent, but you and I both<em>&nbsp;<\/em>know it's not&nbsp;—&nbsp;even the folks who don't use a single editing tool put some effort into their delivery.&nbsp;<\/p><p>But most of all, that pressure only snowballs when I consider how crucial a&nbsp;digital presence is in our industry. Like Alyssa mentioned, I fear that my lack of Instagram a) interest, and b) savvy will discourage employers, publicists and brands from working with (or reaching out to) me in the future. But, consequently, I also&nbsp;<em>don't<\/em> want to have to add 60 hashtags to every post to build a follower base; I often wonder if there's a way to fine-tune your&nbsp;#brand in a more authentic manner.<\/p><p>I know I'm just supposed to \"be myself,\" but what if I don't understand what the Instagram equivalent of \"myself\" is? What I'm really asking is: <em>Who am I?<\/em><\/p><h3>Stephanie Saltzman, Beauty Editor<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BPQUKKyDhwO\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BPQUKKyDhwO\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/15876097_732639613558030_394336581126717440_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQyNzcyOTc0MTU3ODY0MDM5OA%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>In the beauty industry, there's&nbsp;huge pressure to build up an Instagram presence – but I'm an editor, not an #influencer. It took me a little while to realize that those two categories don't necessarily need to overlap. A former colleague of mine was an Instagram master: She'd plan her outfits ahead of time, depending on what she needed to shoot for her feed; she could have taught a seminar on FaceTune. And all of that hard work paid off for her in the form of an impressive following and plenty of subsequent paid activations. But after getting an inside look&nbsp;at the diligence, work ethic and commitment to one's #aesthetic and #brand that are required to truly become successful on Instagram, I realized that I'm just never going to be that person. Sure, I can appreciate a beautiful flatlay as much as the next girl, but I simply don't have the patience (or photography skills, if I'm being honest) to seriously pursue it.<\/p><p>It was sort of like coming to the realization that every single celebrity is wearing hair extensions — no one on TV actually has a naturally ample head of hair (with the exception of, like, Adam Driver). It takes expensive chunks of hair that another person grew and that were then installed by a professional to give Blake Lively all that bounce, so&nbsp;the rest of us should let ourselves off the hook about our (lack of) hair fullness. For me, seeing how an actual influencer operates incited a similar revelation: Becoming a successful Instagrammer with thousands of followers doesn't just happen;&nbsp;it takes work, consistency and a trained eye. So rather than freaking out about it, I took a step back.&nbsp;I just don't have it in me to care that much about Instagram. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting likes and followers (I shamelessly use the excessive hashtags trick), but if I want to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BNMuAMIjpsR/?taken-by=stephsaltzman\">post a photo of George Costanza on Thanksgiving<\/a>, I'm just gonna do it —&nbsp;follower count be damned. Now I use the platform as a source of inspiration and enjoyment, not one of stress or feelings of inadequacy.<\/p><h3>Maria Bobila, Associate Editor<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BHnlT0dB445\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BHnlT0dB445\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/13649304_2060725384152031_1413406229_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTI5MDE2MzkwNzk3NzUxNDU1Mw%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>Kendall Jenner, Instagirl, recently came to a breaking point that caused her to quit Instagram,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2016/11/kendall-jenner-quits-instagram\">explaining<\/a>: \"I would wake up in the morning and look at it first thing; I would go to bed and it was the last thing I would look at. I felt a little too dependent on it.\" I used to make a point to scroll through my Instagram feed in the morning and at night until I knew that I had seen everything that was new. But when posting in chronological order was no more, I felt&nbsp;like I was trapped in an endless black hole&nbsp;of flat lays, travel photos, personal style posts and memes. I probably looked like a frozen robot zombie with a weird backlight face glow and whose right thumb was the only thing that can move. I've started to grow impatient with the need to consume so much&nbsp;Instagram content, but then FOMO strikes: Did I miss a cool city to put on my bucket list? What did [insert a stylish person I follow]&nbsp;wear today? Is there a meme I can send to my boyfriend so he can just write back \"lol\" because that's pretty much all we do on Instagram these days?<\/p><p>When it comes to posting, I stick to a very specific landscape layout using SquareReady — even though Instagram doesn't crop your photos into squares anymore. How pretentious is that? I swear I'm not an asshole.<\/p><h3>Karina Hoshikawa, Assistant Editor<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BPMIV3xDQze\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BPMIV3xDQze\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/15876458_215780625495835_6561184975595503616_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQyNjU1MTg2OTMyOTQ0NDA2Mg%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>I first started using Instagram in high school for the sole purpose of editing my photos with cool filters — the social aspect of using the app as a way to communicate hadn't really caught on yet. (It's for this reason that my first photo on Instagram is probably something random from that period of my life — freshly made cookies or my collection of Harry Potter books. I'm&nbsp;a little too nervous to look.) With that in mind, it's pretty insane to think of how it's evolved to become so intertwined with fashion media and essential in establishing a personal #brand.&nbsp;<\/p><p>However, even though I'm not in high school anymore — and am slightly less obsessed with Harry Potter —&nbsp;baking and books are still two of my favorite things, which is why my feed today is still clogged with pictures of food and shamelessly Instagrammable bookstores and cafés. But as someone who works in fashion, I've definitely felt the pressure to curate my feed to be more consistent with my work as an editor. (In other words, how many pictures of cookies are <em>too<\/em> many pictures of cookies? Should I be doing more flatlays of my makeup stash?) Truth is, as much I feel that being a \"fashion person\" relies on a certain degree of (tasteful!) self-promotion, I'm probably never going to be a \"selfie\" kind of girl and am still figuring out my Instagram #aesthetic. But if nothing else, I'd like to think I've evolved my digital presence since a certain teenage penchant for Amaro…<\/p><h3>Whitney Bauck, Assistant Editor<\/h3><div tml-external-provider=\"instagram\" tml-external-id=\"BNvbJl4AgPb\" tml-embed-src=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BNvbJl4AgPb\" tml-render-layout=\"inline\" tml-embed-thumbnail=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/15276529_1156496374399709_4994925945954500608_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTQwMDQ1NzQxNTUzNDcwNzY3NQ%3D%3D.2\"><\/div><p>I didn't get a smartphone until a year and a half ago, so I was pretty late to the Insta game. In college, it seemed like my best friends were either social media crazy — as in I had to repeatedly ask them to stop looking at their phones when we were together — or they were the kind of people who fantasized about going completely off the grid and working on a farm.<\/p><p>As a result of being surrounded by those two extremes, I'd given a decent amount of thought to what I wanted my engagement with Instagram to look like by the time I actually made an account (as opposed to something like Facebook that I joined instinctively as a teen). I definitely don't do this perfectly, but my general goal is&nbsp;to walk the line between checking IG obsessively and totally disengaging from it; I see it as a platform that's important for participating in this industry, but I don't want to become addicted. I guess regulating how <em>much<\/em> time I spend on it has thus far been more important to me than regulating whether&nbsp;I'm sharing the \"right\" stuff.<\/p><p>In terms of posting things, I still get excited when I can use Instagram as a way to share something I'm really fired up about, whether that's a cause (hello, post-election feels), an ethical brand I wanna hype or an article I wrote that I think would be genuinely useful to people. One of my best friends — who's more of the \"let's go off the grid\" type — always says he's still on Instagram because \"it's where the people are,\" and I guess I'm pretty much in the same boat. If I have something to say that I think matters, I don't want to just say it to myself.<\/p><p><em>Homepage photo: Imaxtree<\/em><\/p><p><a href=\"http://info.fashionista.com/fashionista-newsletter\"><em>Never miss the latest fashion industry news.
