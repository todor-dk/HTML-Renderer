<ul>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<i>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<b>1. THE "LIBERO" PLAYER</b><br>
    Each team has the option to register one specialised defensive player, "Libero"
    among the final list of 12 players for the whole tournament.<br>
    The specific rules for a Libero player are as follows:<br>
    A) He/she is restricted to performing as a back row player and has no right at all to complete an attack hit when the ball is above the height
	of the top of the net.<br>
    B) The Libero may not serve, block or attempt to block.<br>
    C) The Libero must wear a different colour shirt from the other members of the team.<br>
    D) Substitutions involving a Libero are not counted as regular and their number is
    unlimited. A Libero cannot take part in normal substitutions and may only enter or leave
    the game while the ball is out of play and before the whistle for service.<br>
    E) It is necessary to have a rally between replacement of two different players involving
    a Libero.
With the previous approval of the first referee,
    an injured Libero may be substituted during the match by any registered player within the
    normal line-up list of the score sheet.<br>
    G) The designated replacement of a Libero will be limited to performing as a Libero for
    the rest of the match and the subsequent matches.
Nevertheless,
    this player will be allowed to be registered again in the normal line-up of later matches
    once the initially registered Libero is officially re-instituted.<br>
    H) No other player will be authorised to perform as a Libero and in the case of further
    injury of the originally registerd Libero, he/she will be replaced by the same player
    under the same conditions as stated in 
    previous points.

<b>Substitution System</b>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Rule 11.3 is amended to reflect the use of the Libero Defensive Player in
the United States Rules. These rules will be in effect for the 1999 USA
Volleyball Open Championships, Open Division and, beginning November 1999,
for any USA Volleyball Open competition.  Any team participating in Open
Competition has the option to register a Libero player on its roster.
Regular substitutions remain limited to six team subs and one individual
entry per player.
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Only one Libero will be allowed per team. There are special rules if the
Libero player is injured and cannot continue. The Libero player's number
must be placed on the line-up sheet for the first game of each match, in
addition to the numbers for the starting six players. The Libero player must
wear a uniform of a different and contrasting color and/or design than that
of the rest of the team in order to be readily recognized on the court.
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Libero Playing Actions: The Libero may replace any player in a back row
position. The Libero may not serve, block or attempt to block. The Libero
may not complete an attack-hit from anywhere if at the moment of contact the
ball is entirely higher than the top of the net.  A teammate may not
complete an attack-hit on a ball coming from an overhead pass using the
fingers by the Libero if the Libero sets while in the front zone.  The ball
may be freely attacked if the Libero makes the same set from behind the
front zone.
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
Libero Replacements: When the Libero replaces a player in the back zone, it
is not counted as a substitution.  These replacements are unlimited.  Only
the player whom he/she replaced may replace the Libero. After the Libero is
replaced, he/she must stay out one rally before replacing another player in
the back zone. Replacements may take place: 1) at the start of the game
after the 2nd referee has checked the line-up and 2) while the ball is out
of play before the 1st referee blows the whistle for service.
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
