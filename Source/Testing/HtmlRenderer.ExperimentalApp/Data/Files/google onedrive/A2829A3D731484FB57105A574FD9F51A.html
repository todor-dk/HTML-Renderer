  <p>OneDrive has gone through many changes and names over the years. The service has been known as SkyDrive, Live Mesh, FolderShare, and other things since its birth. Its functionality has morphed to a point of slick usablity, reliability, and a rich feature set. Most recently, Microsoft announced that it would <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/news/72736/microsoft-dumps-onedrive-unlimited-storage">downgrade storage limits</a> starting some time in early 2016 (details below). Nevertheless, Microsoft's <a class="" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/storage-devices-reviews/feature/3682/the-best-cloud-storage-solutions">cloud-storage and file-syncing</a> offering continues to improve, despite the smaller storage allotments. OneDrive includes attractive Web and mobile interfaces (now with offline capability), music streaming, shared desktop-folder syncing, real-time coauthoring in Office, notifications of others' edits, and full-document searching in shared files. The service is also deeply integrated with <a class="" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/windows-10/69981/review/windows-10">Windows 10</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="26382"></a>, which sees it as just another file folder.</p>

<p>Microsoft's online backup and syncing service is still very flexible and cross-platform capable, with syncing and access apps not only for PCs, but also for Macs, Androids, iOS devices, and Windows Phones. It integrates seamlessly with <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-office-2016-for-windows">Microsoft Office 2016</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="27849"></a> (both the installed and online versions) and includes rich photo presentation. Apple's competing <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/icloud">iCloud</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="26347"></a> is only available for Apple devices. And while iCloud Drive and Google Drive now make stuff stored in that cloud service available on the Web, OneDrive tops that by even making PC files that you didn't specifically upload available. For all this power and flexibility—not to mention eminently attractive and usable interface, OneDrive remains a PCMag Editors' Choice.</p>

<p>Like Apple iCloud, OneDrive serves a lot of functions. If you just want access to documents or media files, it offers simple online storage accessible from the Web. If you want the same set of files replicated on multiple PCs, it provides folder syncing. For users of Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Phone, it backs up device settings, including things like lock-screen and desktop-background images and email logins. Because of this diversity of function, there are several different cross-sections from which you can view the service—by type of data, client, or function. The data types include documents, photos, video, music, or settings. The clients include computer, mobile, and Web, and the functions are things like syncing, viewing, playing, and simple storage. Let's take a look at the service from these various angles.</p>

<p><span class="inline-image full-width"></span></p><div align="center"><img  alt="Microsoft OneDrive Web" border="0" class="embed" src="http://www5.pcmag.com/media/images/475826-microsoft-onedrive-web.jpg?thumb=y"/ itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"></div><p></p>

<p><strong>Your OneDrive Account</strong><br/> Anyone can get a free OneDrive account—well, anyone who's created a Microsoft account, which includes everyone who's ever signed up for a Hotmail, Live, or <a class="" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/outlookcom">Outlook.com</a> account. Free users get 5GB free storage space (reduced from 15GB in 2016), but if you're a longtime OneDrive account holder (since April 21, 2012, or earlier), you get an extra 10GB free. This compares with 1GB free for iCloud, 2GB for Dropbox, and 15GB for Google Drive. Office 365 users get an extra terabyte for their $6.99-per-month subscription, and anyone can add 50GB to OneDrive for $1.99 per month. The <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-surface-pro-3/32489/review/microsoft-surface-pro-4">Microsoft Surface Pro 4</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="28027"></a> and even inexpensive tablets come with 1TB included. And you can get significantly more free storage through Bing Rewards and referrals. Here's a summary of the pricing compared with that of the other services:</p>

<p><span class="inline-image full-width"></span></p><div align="center"><img  alt="Online Storage Pricing" border="0" class="embed" src="http://www1.pcmag.com/media/images/484267-online-storage-pricing.jpg?thumb=y"/ itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"></div><p></p>

<p></p><h3>Device Syncing </h3>Microsoft likes to refer to OneDrive as a "device cloud." With Windows 10 PCs and Windows Phones, the moniker makes sense. The service can sync settings and apps on those types of devices, while clients for iOS, Android, and Mac OS X give users of those devices access to the files stored in OneDrive's online folders.<p></p>

<p>Like iCloud for iPhones and iPads, OneDrive lets smartphone users—with iPhones or Androids running the service's app as well as Windows Phones—automatically upload photos (and videos) taken with the phone's camera to OneDrive's camera roll. This way, the photos are quickly available for viewing online, in a OneDrive folder on a PC, in a Windows 10 PC's Photos app, on the Web, or in any other OneDrive app you have installed. In the OneDrive Web interface, you can view the photos as a slideshow, and even see a map of where they were taken along with <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/42848/exif">EXIF</a> camera info. Apple's iCloud and <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="27315"></a> can also show synced photos on the Web, but without map or EXIF data.</p>

<p>Another service in the realm of device syncing is the ability to sign into your account and reproduce a previous machine you've set up—color and background themes, social and email accounts, user photo, browser favorites and history, and even apps. OneDrive accomplishes this for both Windows 8.x and Windows 10 PCs and Windows Phones. But the service goes even further, by allowing third-party apps to take advantage of your cloud storage. Apps and sites can even use the service for single sign-on with your permission.</p>

<p><strong>Folder and File Syncing </strong><br/>OneDrive offers another desktop computer-centric function—file and folder syncing. This convenience is similar to what you get with <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/dropbox/2590/review/dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://uk.pcmag.com/sugarsync">SugarSync</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="6121"></a>. In the past, Microsoft had separate storage and syncing services. The joining of online storage and syncing into one cloud service is a refreshing simplification of a previously somewhat confusing set of systems.</p>

<p>OneDrive syncing on computers differs from the earlier Mesh in that you can't designate any old folder you want to be synced, only those under the OneDrive main folder. But Microsoft has made it possible for these synced folders to look less sequestered in the OneDrive world, by using Windows' Libraries. It also adds a truly cool feature called Fetch—more about that in a moment.</p>

<p>The desktop clients for OneDrive syncing run on Windows Vista through Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.7.3 or later. They're quick to install, with a setup wizard that lets you create an account if you don't already have one. It then shows how your OneDrive folder will appear in Windows Explorer (or Finder), with its little blue cloud icon instead of the traditional yellow folder icon. Setup also places a cloud icon in your system tray, from which you can open your synced folder or change settings.</p>

<p>When you place a photo, document, or other item in the created OneDrive folder, it automatically appears in any of your other OneDrive clients on any of your other computers. You can even share a whole folder, but to coedit documents in the online versions of Office applications you have to share individual files.</p>

<p>For a quick test, I went over to my Windows 8.1 PC and created a new folder in the OneDrive app, which appeared seconds later in a Windows 7 machine's OneDrive folder that I had set up. Including OneDrive in Windows Explorer is incredibly helpful because you can save work from any application to your cloud storage directly, without having to go to a website.</p>

<p></p><h3>Windows 10 and Mobile Clients </h3>With Windows 10, OneDrive becomes more of a built-in capability. Its separate modern app version is gone, which makes sense, as it pretty much duplicated the Web view of OneDrive. In the new OS, you see OneDrive in the File Explorer. In Windows 10, you can choose which OneDrive folders are synced or have everything synced. Results in Cortana searches for files now include OneDrive files, and the new Groove Music service can stream any music files you upload to OneDrive. One disappointment for me, however, is that standard apps like Photos don't offer OneDrive as a share target, while third-party services like Facebook and Twitter do.<p></p>

<p>OneDrive is built into Windows 8.<em>x</em>, Windows 10 and Windows Phone, as long as you've signed into a Microsoft account. But what if you use other technology platforms? OneDrive includes syncing and file-access apps for not only Windows 7 and 8, but for Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. For other mobile platforms such as Blackberry, a mobile Web interface is available, and for desktop access when you're not at your own computer, the full-feature Web app is available.</p>

<p><span class="inline-image full-width"></span></p><div align="center"><img  alt="OneDrive on iOS" border="0" class="embed" src="http://www9.pcmag.com/media/images/475827-onedrive-on-ios.jpg?thumb=y"/ itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"></div><p></p>

<p>Mobile apps for OneDrive have made the jump beyond the smartphone: <a class="" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/apple-watch/41451/review/apple-watch">Apple Watch</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-ziffcat="26729"></a> and Android Wear versions are now available, which let you do things like cycle through recent photos on the watch face. As mentioned, there's no more modern Windows app for tablet use—instead, OneDrive is built into the File Explorer and share panels. And of course there's always the Web interface.</p>

<p>The mobile apps let you not only view anything stored up in your OneDrive, but also upload photos and share anything stored via the cloud to anyone with an email address or Facebook account. They even can show photos grouped by tag subject.</p>

<p>I tried out mobile access to OneDrive on my iPhone 5 and an Android Samsung Galaxy S5. The OneDrive apps are nicely designed, clearly showing my cloud folders, and even letting me view photos and documents (even spreadsheets and PDFs) within the app. They also let me share anything in the folders via an email link (with view only or edit permissions), or to copy items to the phone's cut-and-paste clipboard. You can now also designate files for offline viewing and editing.</p>

<p>Happily, Microsoft has added a search capability to the mobile apps. All of the mobile apps also now let you automatically upload any photos (and optionally videos) shot on the device using the "Automatically upload to OneDrive" option. You can also now watch videos on the phone. One cool thing was the ability to upload photos from the iPhone's camera roll or other galleries, marking multiple folders for upload. But the fetch feature to find any files on the PC signed into the same OneDrive account isn't available in the mobile clients.</p>

<p>Another OneDrive option for mobile users is the collection of Office Mobile apps—Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile, and OneNote. These are available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 (both desktop and mobile), and on the Web. In fact, the Web version of OneDrive offers a big dropdown menu of tiles for all these online apps. Documents you create in these are be automatically synced to all your OneDrive access points.</p>

<p><span class="inline-image full-width"></span></p><div align="center"><img  alt="OneDrive Web Apps" border="0" class="embed" src="http://www4.pcmag.com/media/images/475829-onedrive-web-apps.jpg?thumb=y"/ itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"></div><p></p>

<p><strong>OneDrive on the Web and Fetch</strong><br/> Web access to all your cloud data is one thing you don't get in Apple's iCloud. The Web app is linked with other Microsoft online services through a top switcher menu that includes Mail (either Outlook.com or Hotmail), People (the social network-aggregator app), and Calendar. It's a very fast and clean interface, with a left panel of menu choices including Files, Recent docs, Shared, Groups, and PCs.</p>

<p>This last item may be the most interesting: For PCs you've installed the desktop client on and authorized, you can pull any files using Fetch, even if the files aren't in the OneDrive folder. When I chose the PCs option from the Web interface's left rail, I was greeted by a message saying "Security check! To connect to this PC we need you to enter a security code. This extra step only takes a minute and will help protect your computer from unauthorized access." When I clicked the "Sign in with security code" link and completed a partial email address, an email to an associated address was sent with a code.</p>

<p><span class="inline-image full-width"></span></p><div align="center"><img  alt="OneDrive Fetch" border="0" class="embed" src="http://www3.pcmag.com/media/images/475828-onedrive-fetch.jpg?thumb=y"/ itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"></div><p></p>

<p>Once I jumped all the security hurdles, I could browse the entire disk of the target PC. I could download any files found there, or upload them to OneDrive (which feels a little odd, since it seemed like I was browsing OneDrive). I could also view all the files' pertinent properties in a right-side panel—type, size, and dates created and modified. The Fetch feature is a great idea, though it seems to be only available in a very limited set of circumstances. You're probably better off just saving files you think you may need remote access to your OneDrive cloud folders.</p>

<p></p><h3>Media Support </h3>Microsoft's cloud service handles all the most common types of files you might want to store in the cloud, including documents, music, photos, and video. Here's a rundown of how each is handled:<p></p>

<p><strong><em>Documents. </em></strong>Not only can you download and upload document files, as you can with iCloud's Web interface, you can actually view and edit them online with OneDrive using the integrated Office Online apps. In fact, OneDrive serves as the main folder and file location for all your Office Online documents, just as Google Drive now does for Google Docs. Just as in Google Docs, multiple authors can edit documents at the same time. An icon shows who's typing where, and the document contents are updated live. Office Online also offers better document formatting fidelity than you get with Docs.</p>

<p>I had no problem viewing Microsoft file formats like Word Documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations using the online Office apps. I could also view PDFs, and Windows knew to open a ZIP file on the desktop, showing the archive's contents in a folder. <a class="" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/microsoft-office-365-home-premium">Office 365</a><a class="zdcse" data-affiliate-etilize="1024626329" style="display:none"></a> applications have OneDrive baked in, too, as the default save location. This is pretty convenient when you want to work on a file at home that you started at work.</p>

<p><strong><em>Music. </em></strong>With the launch of Groove, Microsoft's streaming music service that replaces Xbox Music, OneDrive now gets the ability to stream any songs you upload to it from the Web. The <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2386534,00.asp">iTunes in the Cloud piece</a> of the iCloud service performs this feat for Apple devices and computers, while Google Play Music does so for the Android folks. OneDrive lacks the "match" service those services offer, which gets you high-quality copies of your music without having to upload them.</p>

<p><span id="Default_template1_ctlBody_lblImageId"><span class="inline-image full-width"></span></span></p><div align="center"><img  alt="OneDrive Music" border="0" class="embed" src="http://www5.pcmag.com/media/images/475830-onedrive-music.jpg?thumb=y"/ itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"></div><p></p>

<p><strong><em>Photos and Video. </em></strong>OneDrive does a pretty impressive job of displaying photos and videos in its Web interface. A beta feature even auto-tags images the way <a class="" href="http://uk.pcmag.com/flickr">Flickr</a> does, grouping, for example, all photos of dogs, crowds, or buildings by tag. You can share and tag photos by yourself, too, and when you do share, unlike in the past, the recipient doesn't have to sign into a Microsoft account. You can also specify read and edit rights.</p>

<p>When you share a video from OneDrive, the cloud service transcodes it on the fly using <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP" target="_blank">MPEG-DASH</a> to match the capabilities of the receiver's bandwidth. This way if you share to someone's phone, he or she won't download an unnecessarily large file that would be prone to pause the video for buffering. I tried sharing a video to a phone with just three bars of LTE connectivity, and my test movie played smoothly and clearly without interruption.</p>

<p>OneDrive also now includes OCR, which extracts text from images. If you save a photo with text in it to your cloud storage, the Info panel on its OneDrive page includes an Extracted text area, which you can click to cut and paste anywhere. Google Drive's help talks about OCR, but I couldn't find it in the live service; perhaps it's another casualty of feature culling. And forget any OCR in iCloud or Dropbox.</p>

<p><strong>Using OneDrive From Other Windows Modern Apps</strong><br/> What makes OneDrive an integral part of the Windows ecosystem is the fact that any Windows modern-style app can take advantage of its cloud storage. Microsoft has made it really simple for developers to do this, as a <a class="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/28/extending-quot-windows-8-quot-apps-to-the-cloud-with-skydrive.aspx" target="_blank">Windows blog post described</a>. For example, the FotoEditor app, a sort of Instagram without the social networking, let me save my distorted image to OneDrive. It also let me open photos for editing from my cloud folders. We'll definitely see more extensive use of OneDrive in third-party apps as the Window Store fills out, particularly those that need to use app state and settings syncing.</p>

<p><strong>One Place in the Cloud for Your Digital Life</strong><br/> Microsoft's cloud solution has come together nicely in OneDrive, combining file syncing with online backup, and cloud storage. Cross-platform support for Macs, iOS devices, and Android devices is a smart move on Microsoft's part, too. That's not to say that there aren't other great choices out there, however; Google Drive is also an excellent service, especially for those who are committed to Google's online ecosystem and for its more-generous 15GB free storage. And Box, another PCMag Editors' Choice, excels in third-party service integration.

    "name": "Microsoft OneDrive",
    "reviewBody": "OneDrive has gone through many changes and names over the years. The service has been known as SkyDrive, Live Mesh, FolderShare, and other things since its birth. Its functionality has morphed to a point of slick usablity, reliability, and a rich feature set. Most recently, Microsoft announced that it would downgrade storage limits starting some time in early 2016 (details below). Nevertheless, Microsoft\u0027s cloud\u002Dstorage and file\u002Dsyncing offering continues to improve, despite the smaller storage allotments. OneDrive includes attractive Web and mobile interfaces (now with offline capability), music streaming, shared desktop\u002Dfolder syncing, real\u002Dtime coauthoring in Office, notifications of others\u0027 edits, and full\u002Ddocument searching in shared files. The service is also deeply integrated with Windows 10, which sees it as just another file folder.  Microsoft\u0027s online backup and syncing service is still very flexible and cross\u002Dplatform capable, with syncing and access apps not only for PCs, but also for Macs, Androids, iOS devices, and Windows Phones. It integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Office 2016 (both the installed and online versions) and includes rich photo presentation. Apple\u0027s competing iCloud is only available for Apple devices. And while iCloud Drive and Google Drive now make stuff stored in that cloud service available on the Web, OneDrive tops that by even making PC files that you didn\u0027t specifically upload available. For all this power and flexibility—not to mention eminently attractive and usable interface, OneDrive remains a PCMag Editors\u0027 Choice.                                                                                VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY        Like Apple iCloud, OneDrive serves a lot of functions. If you just want access to documents or media files, it offers simple online storage accessible from the Web. If you want the same set of files replicated on multiple PCs, it provides folder syncing. For users of Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows Phone, it backs up device settings, including things like lock\u002Dscreen and desktop\u002Dbackground images and email logins. Because of this diversity of function, there are several different cross\u002Dsections from which you can view the service—by type of data, client, or function. The data types include documents, photos, video, music, or settings. The clients include computer, mobile, and Web, and the functions are things like syncing, viewing, playing, and simple storage. Let\u0027s take a look at the service from these various angles.    Your OneDrive Account Anyone can get a free OneDrive account—well, anyone who\u0027s created a Microsoft account, which includes everyone who\u0027s ever signed up for a Hotmail, Live, or Outlook.com account. Free users get 5GB free storage space (reduced from 15GB in 2016), but if you\u0027re a longtime OneDrive account holder (since April 21, 2012, or earlier), you get an extra 10GB free. This compares with 1GB free for iCloud, 2GB for Dropbox, and 15GB for Google Drive. Office 365 users get an extra terabyte for their $6.99\u002Dper\u002Dmonth subscription, and anyone can add 50GB to OneDrive for $1.99 per month. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and even inexpensive tablets come with 1TB included. And you can get significantly more free storage through Bing Rewards and referrals. Here\u0027s a summary of the pricing compared with that of the other services:    Device Syncing Microsoft likes to refer to OneDrive as a \u0022device cloud.\u0022 With Windows 10 PCs and Windows Phones, the moniker makes sense. The service can sync settings and apps on those types of devices, while clients for iOS, Android, and Mac OS X give users of those devices access to the files stored in OneDrive\u0027s online folders.  Like iCloud for iPhones and iPads, OneDrive lets smartphone users—with iPhones or Androids running the service\u0027s app as well as Windows Phones—automatically upload photos (and videos) taken with the phone\u0027s camera to OneDrive\u0027s camera roll. This way, the photos are quickly available for viewing online, in a OneDrive folder on a PC, in a Windows 10 PC\u0027s Photos app, on the Web, or in any other OneDrive app you have installed. In the OneDrive Web interface, you can view the photos as a slideshow, and even see a map of where they were taken along with EXIF camera info. Apple\u0027s iCloud and Google Drive can also show synced photos on the Web, but without map or EXIF data.  Another service in the realm of device syncing is the ability to sign into your account and reproduce a previous machine you\u0027ve set up—color and background themes, social and email accounts, user photo, browser favorites and history, and even apps. OneDrive accomplishes this for both Windows 8.x and Windows 10 PCs and Windows Phones. But the service goes even further, by allowing third\u002Dparty apps to take advantage of your cloud storage. Apps and sites can even use the service for single sign\u002Don with your permission.  Folder and File Syncing OneDrive offers another desktop computer\u002Dcentric function—file and folder syncing. This convenience is similar to what you get with Dropbox and SugarSync. In the past, Microsoft had separate storage and syncing services. The joining of online storage and syncing into one cloud service is a refreshing simplification of a previously somewhat confusing set of systems.  OneDrive syncing on computers differs from the earlier Mesh in that you can\u0027t designate any old folder you want to be synced, only those under the OneDrive main folder. But Microsoft has made it possible for these synced folders to look less sequestered in the OneDrive world, by using Windows\u0027 Libraries. It also adds a truly cool feature called Fetch—more about that in a moment.  The desktop clients for OneDrive syncing run on Windows Vista through Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.7.3 or later. They\u0027re quick to install, with a setup wizard that lets you create an account if you don\u0027t already have one. It then shows how your OneDrive folder will appear in Windows Explorer (or Finder), with its little blue cloud icon instead of the traditional yellow folder icon. Setup also places a cloud icon in your system tray, from which you can open your synced folder or change settings.  When you place a photo, document, or other item in the created OneDrive folder, it automatically appears in any of your other OneDrive clients on any of your other computers. You can even share a whole folder, but to coedit documents in the online versions of Office applications you have to share individual files.  For a quick test, I went over to my Windows 8.1 PC and created a new folder in the OneDrive app, which appeared seconds later in a Windows 7 machine\u0027s OneDrive folder that I had set up. Including OneDrive in Windows Explorer is incredibly helpful because you can save work from any application to your cloud storage directly, without having to go to a website.  Windows 10 and Mobile Clients With Windows 10, OneDrive becomes more of a built\u002Din capability. Its separate modern app version is gone, which makes sense, as it pretty much duplicated the Web view of OneDrive. In the new OS, you see OneDrive in the File Explorer. In Windows 10, you can choose which OneDrive folders are synced or have everything synced. Results in Cortana searches for files now include OneDrive files, and the new Groove Music service can stream any music files you upload to OneDrive. One disappointment for me, however, is that standard apps like Photos don\u0027t offer OneDrive as a share target, while third\u002Dparty services like Facebook and Twitter do.  OneDrive is built into Windows 8.x, Windows 10 and Windows Phone, as long as you\u0027ve signed into a Microsoft account. But what if you use other technology platforms? OneDrive includes syncing and file\u002Daccess apps for not only Windows 7 and 8, but for Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. For other mobile platforms such as Blackberry, a mobile Web interface is available, and for desktop access when you\u0027re not at your own computer, the full\u002Dfeature Web app is available.    Mobile apps for OneDrive have made the jump beyond the smartphone: Apple Watch and Android Wear versions are now available, which let you do things like cycle through recent photos on the watch face. As mentioned, there\u0027s no more modern Windows app for tablet use—instead, OneDrive is built into the File Explorer and share panels. And of course there\u0027s always the Web interface.  The mobile apps let you not only view anything stored up in your OneDrive, but also upload photos and share anything stored via the cloud to anyone with an email address or Facebook account. They even can show photos grouped by tag subject.  I tried out mobile access to OneDrive on my iPhone 5 and an Android Samsung Galaxy S5. The OneDrive apps are nicely designed, clearly showing my cloud folders, and even letting me view photos and documents (even spreadsheets and PDFs) within the app. They also let me share anything in the folders via an email link (with view only or edit permissions), or to copy items to the phone\u0027s cut\u002Dand\u002Dpaste clipboard. You can now also designate files for offline viewing and editing.  Happily, Microsoft has added a search capability to the mobile apps. All of the mobile apps also now let you automatically upload any photos (and optionally videos) shot on the device using the \u0022Automatically upload to OneDrive\u0022 option. You can also now watch videos on the phone. One cool thing was the ability to upload photos from the iPhone\u0027s camera roll or other galleries, marking multiple folders for upload. But the fetch feature to find any files on the PC signed into the same OneDrive account isn\u0027t available in the mobile clients.  Another OneDrive option for mobile users is the collection of Office Mobile apps—Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile, and OneNote. These are available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10 (both desktop and mobile), and on the Web. In fact, the Web version of OneDrive offers a big dropdown menu of tiles for all these online apps. Documents you create in these are be automatically synced to all your OneDrive access points.    OneDrive on the Web and Fetch Web access to all your cloud data is one thing you don\u0027t get in Apple\u0027s iCloud. The Web app is linked with other Microsoft online services through a top switcher menu that includes Mail (either Outlook.com or Hotmail), People (the social network\u002Daggregator app), and Calendar. It\u0027s a very fast and clean interface, with a left panel of menu choices including Files, Recent docs, Shared, Groups, and PCs.  This last item may be the most interesting: For PCs you\u0027ve installed the desktop client on and authorized, you can pull any files using Fetch, even if the files aren\u0027t in the OneDrive folder. When I chose the PCs option from the Web interface\u0027s left rail, I was greeted by a message saying \u0022Security check! To connect to this PC we need you to enter a security code. This extra step only takes a minute and will help protect your computer from unauthorized access.\u0022 When I clicked the \u0022Sign in with security code\u0022 link and completed a partial email address, an email to an associated address was sent with a code.    Once I jumped all the security hurdles, I could browse the entire disk of the target PC. I could download any files found there, or upload them to OneDrive (which feels a little odd, since it seemed like I was browsing OneDrive). I could also view all the files\u0027 pertinent properties in a right\u002Dside panel—type, size, and dates created and modified. The Fetch feature is a great idea, though it seems to be only available in a very limited set of circumstances. You\u0027re probably better off just saving files you think you may need remote access to your OneDrive cloud folders.  Media Support Microsoft\u0027s cloud service handles all the most common types of files you might want to store in the cloud, including documents, music, photos, and video. Here\u0027s a rundown of how each is handled:  Documents. Not only can you download and upload document files, as you can with iCloud\u0027s Web interface, you can actually view and edit them online with OneDrive using the integrated Office Online apps. In fact, OneDrive serves as the main folder and file location for all your Office Online documents, just as Google Drive now does for Google Docs. Just as in Google Docs, multiple authors can edit documents at the same time. An icon shows who\u0027s typing where, and the document contents are updated live. Office Online also offers better document formatting fidelity than you get with Docs.  I had no problem viewing Microsoft file formats like Word Documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations using the online Office apps. I could also view PDFs, and Windows knew to open a ZIP file on the desktop, showing the archive\u0027s contents in a folder. Office 365 applications have OneDrive baked in, too, as the default save location. This is pretty convenient when you want to work on a file at home that you started at work.  Music. With the launch of Groove, Microsoft\u0027s streaming music service that replaces Xbox Music, OneDrive now gets the ability to stream any songs you upload to it from the Web. The iTunes in the Cloud piece of the iCloud service performs this feat for Apple devices and computers, while Google Play Music does so for the Android folks. OneDrive lacks the \u0022match\u0022 service those services offer, which gets you high\u002Dquality copies of your music without having to upload them.    Photos and Video. OneDrive does a pretty impressive job of displaying photos and videos in its Web interface. A beta feature even auto\u002Dtags images the way Flickr does, grouping, for example, all photos of dogs, crowds, or buildings by tag. You can share and tag photos by yourself, too, and when you do share, unlike in the past, the recipient doesn\u0027t have to sign into a Microsoft account. You can also specify read and edit rights.  When you share a video from OneDrive, the cloud service transcodes it on the fly using MPEG\u002DDASH to match the capabilities of the receiver\u0027s bandwidth. This way if you share to someone\u0027s phone, he or she won\u0027t download an unnecessarily large file that would be prone to pause the video for buffering. I tried sharing a video to a phone with just three bars of LTE connectivity, and my test movie played smoothly and clearly without interruption.  OneDrive also now includes OCR, which extracts text from images. If you save a photo with text in it to your cloud storage, the Info panel on its OneDrive page includes an Extracted text area, which you can click to cut and paste anywhere. Google Drive\u0027s help talks about OCR, but I couldn\u0027t find it in the live service\u003B perhaps it\u0027s another casualty of feature culling. And forget any OCR in iCloud or Dropbox.  Using OneDrive From Other Windows Modern Apps What makes OneDrive an integral part of the Windows ecosystem is the fact that any Windows modern\u002Dstyle app can take advantage of its cloud storage. Microsoft has made it really simple for developers to do this, as a Windows blog post described. For example, the FotoEditor app, a sort of Instagram without the social networking, let me save my distorted image to OneDrive. It also let me open photos for editing from my cloud folders. We\u0027ll definitely see more extensive use of OneDrive in third\u002Dparty apps as the Window Store fills out, particularly those that need to use app state and settings syncing.  One Place in the Cloud for Your Digital Life Microsoft\u0027s cloud solution has come together nicely in OneDrive, combining file syncing with online backup, and cloud storage. Cross\u002Dplatform support for Macs, iOS devices, and Android devices is a smart move on Microsoft\u0027s part, too. That\u0027s not to say that there aren\u0027t other great choices out there, however\u003B Google Drive is also an excellent service, especially for those who are committed to Google\u0027s online ecosystem and for its more\u002Dgenerous 15GB free storage. And Box, another PCMag Editors\u0027 Choice, excels in third\u002Dparty service integration. But as the only cloud service that lets you fetch any file from a PC you\u0027ve set up, and for its integration with Office and third\u002Dparty apps, folder syncing, and multitude of platform options (including mobile devices and a top\u002Dnotch Web interface), Microsoft OneDrive remains an impressive Editors\u0027 Choice for cloud storage and syncing.This article originally appeared on PCMag.com.",
