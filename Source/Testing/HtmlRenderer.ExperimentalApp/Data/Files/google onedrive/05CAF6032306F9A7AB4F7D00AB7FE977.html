<h2>Latest news about Google Docs and OneDrive:</h2><div class="article_text"><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1479401177.jpg"><br><i>17.11.16. Google Docs now let you create custom templates.</i> <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">Google Docs</a>, Sheets, Slides and Forms are getting support for creating custom, reusable templates that you can share with your co-workers. While you may not use templates much in your day-to-day G Suite life, this is a necessary feature for businesses. You don’t want to have to recreate your report or newsletter layout every time you start a new one, after all. For the most part then, the addition of template support in Google Docs is yet another example of Google trying to make its service more attractive to business users as it gets serious about the enterprise.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1422872456.jpg"><br><i>02.02.15. Microsoft gives Apple Users OneDrive For Business Access.</i> Microsoft has released the first public version of <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">OneDrive for Business</a> for Mac. With the new OneDrive for Business for Mac, users will be able to do the same as well as access and use files in their OneDrive through the Mac Finder and manage and sync files in the same way they would with the existing application for Windows. The OneDrive for Business client for Mac also allows users to access and take their OneDrive for Business files offline so users can access downloaded files without having to have access to an Internet connection. However, the real draw is that the iOS app for mobile devices lets users access both their OneDrive for Business and OneDrive consumer accounts from the same app.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1414487805.jpg"><br><i>28.10.14. Office 365 gets unlimited OneDrive storage..</i> As of today, <a href="/tool/Office_365/">Office 365</a> Home, Personal and University customers are getting the storage boost. Business customers will get unlimited storage will get unlimited storage also soon. In the meantime, they have 1 TB of storage per user. OneDrive works much like Google Drive, allowing you to access content on all of your devices, plus share it and collaborate on documents. Google Drive, Box, Dropbox and other cloud-storage utilities, though, have limited storage capabilities. If you meet a limit, you have to buy more. Bitcasa, one of the few platforms to offer unlimited storage, actually ceased that operation last week, giving Microsoft a big advantage in regards to storage.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1409384872.jpg"><br><i>30.08.14. OneDrive unifies access to business and personal files.</i> Microsoft's <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">Onedrive</a> is making it easier for mobile users to access both business and personal files simultaneously (from both personal and work accounts). The app will distinguish which account each file belongs to in order to avoid potential mixups, but users can view and back up files to both accounts. Microsoft will also add an extra layer of security to the app with the ability to set a four-digit PIN that can be required to restrict access to individual files or the entire app. Next week these new features will appear in the Android app and in the coming months the updates will roll out to the iOS and Windows Phone apps.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1409036415.jpg"><br><i>26.08.14. Google Docs for iPhone/iPad now can edit MS Office files.</i> Google is bringing support for natively editing Microsoft Office documents to iOS. Google Docs, Sheets and Slides apps for Android and web browsers added this feature two months ago. With this, Google now offers the full-fledged MS Office alternative on all of its major platforms, including Android, iOS, Chrome OS and the web (it’s unlikely Google will ever launch a Metro app for Windows, though.) Microsoft launched Office for iOS earlier this year. To fully make use of those apps, however, users need a subscription to Office 365. Google’s apps are available for free, though business users are likely already paying for a Google Apps for Business account anyway.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1406617660.jpg"><br><i>28.07.14. Google Docs allows to edit MS Office files without conversion.</i> Google made it possible to edit Microsoft Office files directly in <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">Google Docs</a>, Sheets and Slides, so you can open and edit those documents in their native format using Office Compatibility Mode. No need to buy additional software or think about how to open your file. The Docs, Sheets and Slides mobile apps come with Office editing built right in, and with the Chrome extension, you can edit and share files directly from Google Drive or Gmail. Another new feature -&nbsp; Suggest Edits in Docs. It lets you do just that: your team can make suggestions that you can accept or reject with a single click.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405434183.jpg"><br><i>24.06.14. Microsoft OneDrive gives 15 Gb for free.</i> Microsoft increased the free limit of cloud storage in <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">OneDrive</a> to 15 Gb (previously was 7Gb). If you want more storage capacity, you can now pay $1.99 monthly for 100 gigabytes. The company will also now offer free 1Tb to all Office 365 customers. For example, Office 365 Personal costs $6.99 monthly and now it comes with almost unlimited storage. If compare this to competitors: Google Drive provides 25 Gb free and offers almost similar pricing, charging $1.99 a month for 100GB and $9.99 for 1TB. Apple grants 5GB free, charging $0.99 a month for 20GB. There is no 100GB option, but at 200GB, the rate is the same as OneDrive's, at $3.99. Amazon Cloud Drive gives 5 GB Free and offers 100 Gb for $4.1 per month. So OneDrive's price cut is not a big problem for giants, but further puts the pressure on third-party services such as Dropbox and Box.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405434128.jpg"><br><i>05.05.14. Google launched standalone Docs and Spreadsheets for iOS and Android.</i> Until now, all Google's document editors for mobile devices were available in the single app called Google Drive. Ok, they remained there, but recently Google also launched standalone apps <a href="/out.php?url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/new-mobile-apps-for-docs-sheets-and.html">Google Docs and Google Spreadsheets</a> (for iOS and Android). The presentation app is coming soon, and will be called not Google Presentations, but (for a change) Slides. Maybe, you could think that thus Google wants to unlink the editors from Google Drive and let users edit files not only from Google Drive, but any other documents stored on your smartphone/tablet. But no! In the new apps you still can't open a document without uploading it to the Google Drive cloud storage. So for while there is not so much sense in these standalone apps.<br><br><br><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lZqX6ocwHWU" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><br><i>13.03.14. Google Docs gets Add-ons store, Teamlab Office gets server version..</i> Online office suites continue to evolve. <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">Google Docs</a> adds embedded add-on directory, which is accessible from the top menu Add-ons and contains all sorts of useful things. For example, a plugin for collaborative docs approval, for printing stickers, for integration with Mailchimp (email marketing service), etc. Obviously, this directory will grow day by day. Meanwhile one of the main Google Docs rivals - <a href="/tool/Teamlab_Office/">Teamlab Office</a> unveiled the local version for large companies, that can be installed on the own server. Besides the office document editors, Teamlab Office Enterprise contains the full set of collaboration tools . Teamlab already provided in-house open-source version - Community Edition. It's free but trimmed in functionality. The new Enterprise version costs $1200/year per 30 users. If you think that it's expensive, calculate how much MS Office and SharePoint will cost for the same number of users.<br><br><br><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/e4NsPPUDjyU" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><br><i>28.01.14. Microsoft renames SkyDrive to OneDrive.</i> Actually, Microsoft marketers love to rename applications and services. For example, the cloud storage and file sync service <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">SkyDrive</a> during recent years was named FolderShare, Windows Live Office, Live Mesh. But this time the name change will happen not because the marketers should do some work for their salary, but because last August the British broadcasting company BSkyB won the legal dispute to take the name SkyDrive from Microsoft. So soon (Microsoft doesn't tell more exactly) SkyDrive will become <a href="/out.php?url=http://onedrive.com">OneDrive</a>, and SkyDrive Pro (the version available for business users of Office 365 and SharePoint 2013) - will become OneDrive for Business. Currently the OneDrive <a href="/out.php?url=http://preview.onedrive.com">promo site</a> is available, where you can provide your email to Microsoft marketers. <br><br><br><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/9AyoRkr4I3U" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><br><i>27.01.14. Google, Microsoft and Apple refreshed their online office apps.</i> These are not very important updates, but we thought why not remind you once again that online office apps exist, develop and you may well use them instead of paid Word, Excel and PowerPoint. So, Google updated its <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">spreadsheets</a> (watch video above). Now they work faster, even with a very-very large documents. There are new filters and functions, as well as the ability to work offline in the Chrome browser (just like it works for text documents and presentations). As for Microsoft, they mainly worked to redesign their <a href="/tool/Office_Online/">Office Web Apps</a>. The interface became more flat (like in Outlook.com) and more comfortable thanks to the updated toolbar. And the notebook app OneNote for Android has become like Evernote (watch video below): <br><br><br><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xEY10Ub-k-U" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><br><i>2013. Real-time collaboration in Google Forms.</i> Google added multiuser real-time collaboration to its online forms editor <a href="/out.php?url=http://www.google.com/intl/en_US/drive/start/apps.html#forms">Google Forms</a>. This feature is already available in all other Google office apps: Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, Google Presentations and Google Drawings. Now, when creating a form, you can invite one or more co-workers, control who is currently helping you to build the form, what field he is editing (each user has different color), communicate in chat and comments. In general, after the recent update Google Forms turned into the world's best tool for conducting employee or customer surveys. It allows to add any any kind of fields (text, checkboxes, radio-buttons, lists, tables ...), select a template, embed form to your site, collect the entered data into a spreadsheet or view it on a graphical report.<br><br><br><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5tthVEzX-UI?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><br><i>2012. Google Drive for iOS now can edit documents.</i> In July, when Google released a mobile client <a href="/tool/Google_Drive/">Google Drive</a> for iOS, users were disappointed by the lack of ability to edit documents on iPhone/iPad. Today, Google has fixed this drawback, but with some limitations. Editing (including real-time collaboration editing) is available only for text documents. Though the video shows that spreadsheets can also be edited, in fact, it's just a special effect. Editing spreadsheets will appear later. Besides, Google added the ability to view presentations, create new folders and move files between folders. Google Drive for <a href="/tool/Android/">Android</a> app has been also updated today. It now also features the ability to create folders, move files and add comments to files and documents.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405433873.jpg"><br><i>2012. Microsoft launched SkyDrive for Android.</i> Earlier this month, Microsoft updated the online version of its file storage and sharing service <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">SkyDrive</a> (implemented the Metro-Windows-8 interface there), and today the company has released the mobile SkyDrive app for Android. It allows to access your files (including the files shared with you) from Android-smartphone or tablet, view and edit files in other applications, upload new and edited files back to the server. Besides this Android app, SkyDrive's mobile application works on iPhone / iPad and Windows Phone. Also, SkyDrive is by default built into Windows 8. Recall, SkyDrive competes with services like <a href="/tool/DropBox/">DropBox</a>, <a href="/tool/Google_Drive/">Google Drive</a>, <a href="/tool/SugarSync/">SugarSync</a> and provides 7 GB of free cloud storage, which is much larger than the competitors.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405433863.jpg"><br><i>2012. New Office Web Apps add mobile touch interface, real-time collaboration.</i> Microsoft started preview testing of the new version of its browser-based document editing applications <a href="/tool/Office_Online/">Office Web Apps</a>. Everybody can already join the preview on the <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">SkyDrive</a> or <a href="/tool/Office_365/">Office 365</a>. The first thing that has changed - is the interface. It's now exactly like the upcoming Office 2013. And the main feature of this interface - is its adaption to the tablets with touch-screen. In general, the main objective pursued by Microsoft in this update - is to improve the performance of Office Web Apps on mobile devices (in mobile browsers). And the new mobile web interface for smartphones, is perhaps even better than its main competitor - <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">Google Docs</a>:<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405433859.jpg"><br><i>2012. SharePoint 2013 will include SkyDrive Pro.</i> Together with Office 2013 Microsoft unveiled the beta version of <a href="/out.php?url=http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/preview/default.aspx">SharePoint 2013</a>. This is still an early version, and we won't review it so far (in particular, it's still no information about possible integration with <a href="/tool/Yammer/">Yammer</a>). But one thing is this beta has already attracted great public interest - SkyDrive Pro. We have previously reported that SharePoint is being attacked by the army of file synchronization services called "<a href="/tool/Dropbox/">Dropbox for Enterprise</a>", and that SkyDrive's technology should help SharePoint to overcome these attacks. And so it happens, but as usual, Microsoft has added an element of chaos to this project. Why was it necessary to create a separate service called SkyDrive Pro? Why they just not added simple file sync functionality to SharePoint without inventing new titles? It's even more confusing as SkyDrive Pro won't replace the existing off-line client - SharePoint Workspace, but will be used along with it.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405433854.jpg"><br><i>2012. Google Docs - on its way to offline.</i> Some day <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">Google Docs</a> will fully support offline access on all computers and mobile devices. But apparently, it will be no earlier than in two years. Because Google likes to delight users with more happy news about the motion of Google Docs to offline. At a recent Google I/O conference the company proudly announced that Google Docs now works Offline! What does it mean this time? The service really now works Offline - but only in the Chrome browser. And to make it work you need to ... install Google Drive app for Chrome. Those readers that are following our news may say that about a year ago we already <a href="/tool/GMail/">reported</a> that Google Docs work offline in Chrome. But then it was about viewing documents, and this time - you can edit docs and even post comments. The changes will be synchronized with the online account once the internet connection appears. And for now you can only edit text documents and spreadsheets. Editing presentations will be obviously the next big news.<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405433834.jpg"><br><i>2012. Google acquired the best mobile office - Quickoffice.</i> It seams that start-ups become cheaper in spring. Every day IT giants are buying someone. During two days Google has bought two companies - Meebo and Quickoffice. The acquisition of social messenger <a href="/tool/Meebo/">Meebo</a> aims to strengthen the social network Google+. And the acquisition of <a href="/tool/QuickOffice/">Quickoffice</a> is much more interesting to us. Quickoffice is known as the best suite of mobile document editors. Quickoffice provides native applications (that can work offline) for iPhone, iPad, Android and even for Symbian and webOS that can perfectly open and edit Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel and PowerPoint). In addition, <a href="/tool/QuickOffice/">Quickoffice</a> can synchronize documents between different platforms, but this feature is likely to be replaced by the <a href="/tool/Google_Drive/">Google Drive</a>. Thus, Google Docs is becoming the dominant office suite not only in the cloud, but also on mobile devices.<br><br><br><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wKJ9KzGQq0w" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe><br><i>2012. Google launched Google Drive.</i> After (just) six years after the first rumors appeared Google has launched the legendary file storage service <a href="/out.php?url=http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a>. And the first question is: why they created Google Drive as a separate service, when <a href="/tool/Google_Docs/">Google Docs</a> is de-facto Google's online storage that can store any files? There is a couple of reasons. First, such file storage and sharing services (Dropbox and clones) is a very hot topic either in consumer or enterprise space. And the attention that Google can attract with the new app in this space is not a bad thing for the search giant. Second, Google Drive will serve as a file system not only for Google Docs, but also for other Google's services that operate files (GMail, Google +, Google Sites, Picasa ...).<br><br><br><img src="http://www.liventerprise.com/pics/news/1405433814.jpg"><br><i>2012. SkyDrive comes to Windows, MacOS and iPad. Reduces free storage.</i> <a href="/tool/OneDrive/">SkyDrive</a>, Microsoft’s online storage service continues to take on <a href="/tool/Dropbox/">Dropbox</a> and add support for new platforms. Following the applications for Windows Phone and iPhone, Microsoft has released the desktop client for Windows and Mac OS (OS X Lion). Also, the SkyDrive's mobile interface has been optimized for iPad tablets. SkyDrive for desktop works in the usual way - it creates a folder on your computer and all the files that you copy to this folder are automatically synced with your online account, as well as with your other computers or mobile devices that are running SkyDrive. And if in the online account you create a shared folder for your work-group, the service will be continuously syncing files between the computers of co-workers.<br><br></div></div> <!-- /content -->
