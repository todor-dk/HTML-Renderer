                    <p><FONT SIZE="-1">Originally recorded in December of
                      1987, Myn Ynd Wymyn was made available on double-length
                      cassette through the original Uncle Bonsai Mailing List and
                      a few stores across the United States. It was intended as a
                      thank you for the amazing fan support the group received
                      throughout its eight year career and included most of the
                      songs that Uncle Bonsai was performing at the end. In
                      addition, a couple of older songs that were not on the two
                      official releases were thrown in. It was re-mastered in
                      1992, with a few changes because of time constraints, for
                      release on compact disc.</FONT></p></TD>

                    <P>I thought I heard the voice of god<BR>
                      I thought I heard a voice from heaven<BR>
                      Saying "stay tuned for details at eleven<BR>
                      I'll be back with weather and news"</P>
                    <P>I thought I heard the voice of god<BR>
                      (She thought she heard a vision)<BR>
                      I invited friends over to eat here<BR>
                      (They watched the television)<BR>
                      Just in case saved and savior should meet here<BR>
                      To talk about their common views</P>
                    <P>For a moment<BR>
                      There was a shadow on the wall<BR>
                      But my cousin down the hall<BR>
                      Said it was only Elvis<BR>
                      Only Elvis<BR>
                      Get out, Elvis, get out<BR>
                      We were waiting<BR>
                      For a miracle to seize us<BR>
                      But if I know our Jesus<BR>
                      He was stuck behind his big fat<BR>
                      (Big fat, Big fat)<BR>
                      Stuck behind his big fat friend</P>
                    <P>Oh Elvis<BR>
                      Fat Boy Elvis<BR>
                      Thanks a lot Elvis</P>
                    <P>I thought I heard the voice of God<BR>
                      I thought I heard the second coming<BR>
                      But couldn't tell with Elvis humming<BR>
                      If there really was a vision in the den<BR>
                      But I figure he can always come again</P>

                        and Women</B></A></P>
                    <P>I knew a boy who said that loneliness would kill him<BR>
                      Until he met a woman who could only give him pain<BR>
                      I knew a girl who said no love could ever fill her<BR>
                      Until she met the only man her soul could not contain<BR>
                      They were married in the summer<BR>
                      And they honeymooned in Europe<BR>
                      And they settled down near Denver<BR>
                      And they hardly said a word<BR>
                      They had two point seven children<BR>
                      And a palace in the suburbs<BR>
                      And their's is the saddest story that I've ever heard<BR>
                      I knew a boy who said that happiness was lethal<BR>
                      Until he met a woman who could cut him down to size<BR>
                      I knew a girl who thought that every man was evil<BR>
                      She sorted through her suitors with a venom in her eyes</P>
                    <P>They were married in the winter<BR>
                      And they settled in the city<BR>
                      And they worked 'til they were tired<BR>
                      And they always seemed to fight<BR>
                      But when no one else could hear them<BR>
                      They would swear their love forever<BR>
                      And whisper through the passion everything's all right</P>
                    <P>Men and Women love each other<BR>
                      Men and Women try so hard<BR>
                      Men and Women wander freely<BR>
                      Armed and deadly<BR>
                      On their guard<BR>
                      Men and Women fool their neighbors<BR>
                      Men and Women rule the world<BR>
                      Men and Women, movers, shapers<BR>
                      Men and Women, boys and girls<BR>
                      <BR>
                      I knew a boy who said that love could never find him<BR>
                      Until he met a woman who would claw her way inside<BR>
                      I knew a girl who said that love would never blind her<BR>
                      Until she met the only man the darkness couldn't hide</P>
                    <P>So they were married for a while<BR>
                      But they parted in September<BR>
                      When she saw that he was changing<BR>
                      And he knew she wouldn't die<BR>
                      But she thinks that he'll remember<BR>
                      And he knows that she'll forget him<BR>
                      And they still feel they were wrong to say good-bye</P>
                    <P>Men and Women cling together<BR>
                      Men and Women sing off key<BR>
                      Men and Women wince at incest<BR>
                      Prince or princess on their knee<BR>
                      Men and Women sagging shriners<BR>
                      Men and Women flags unfurled<BR>
                      Men and Women, braggers, whiners<BR>
                      Men and Women boys and girls</P>
                    <P>He was a quiet man<BR>
                      The neighbors seemed to love him<BR>
                      He always smiled at the children passing by<BR>
                      No one could understand<BR>
                      What demons came to shove him<BR>
                      When he pulled the trigger<BR>
                      When the chainsaw started<BR>
                      Was it hard to figure<BR>
                      Was he broken-hearted<BR>
                      Did the neighbors marvel<BR>
                      At the sudden silence<BR>
                      Did he hate to carpool<BR>
                      Did it lead to violence<BR>
                      When they close the curtains<BR>
                      And they hide inside<BR>
                      Do they know for certain<BR>
                      If he lived or died<BR>
                      <BR>
                      Men and Women stoop to conquer<BR>
                      Men and Women stoop so low<BR>
                      Men and Women filled with doubt<BR>
                      They scream about what they don't know<BR>
                      Men and Women host and hostess<BR>
                      Men and Women social climb<BR>
                      Men and Women fill the churches<BR>
                      Still the urges, kill some time<BR>
                      Men and Women take their places<BR>
                      Men and Women make some noise<BR>
                      Men and Women, well-scrubbed faces<BR>
                      Men and Women, girls and boys</P>

                    <P>Doug leaves his bride to be on early Sunday morning<BR>
                      To take the train to spend the holidays at home<BR>
                      Doug takes his briefcase and a bag of dirty laundry<BR>
                      He takes her photograph<BR>
                      So he won't have to be alone</P>
                    <P>Doug reads the paper as he rumbles through the
                      country<BR>
                      He sleeps and dreams about the girl he left behind<BR>
                      She packed a sandwich should he happen to get hungry<BR>
                      She packed potato chips<BR>
                      So he'd enjoy the trip</P>

                      A friendly smile from the family Chevrolet<BR>
                      Doug greets his father with a sense of trepidation<BR>
                      They take the long way back<BR>
                      They hit the cul-de-sac</P>

                      So tell us Douglas will you ever find a real career<BR>
                      Doug's father shakes his head<BR>
                      And talks of girls instead</P>
                    <P>Doug greets the guest<BR>
                      And takes their coats up to his parents room<BR>

                      Doug tries to smile<BR>
                      In the face of such impending doom<BR>
                      Doug sees his fall from grace<BR>

                    <P>You found the road to heaven<BR>
                      No matter which direction<BR>
                      Across the intersection<BR>
                      You feel the open door<BR>
                      You got a nose for stores<BR>
                      Here in a town that shares<BR>
                      And everybody stares<BR>
                      At everyone who cares<BR>
                      About the shopping wars</P>
                    <P>The bible belt pulls tighter<BR>
                      Or it's the flat-land fever<BR>
                      That makes a true believer<BR>
                      Out of a child wife<BR>
                      Who seems to love her life<BR>
                      She keeps her man alive<BR>
                      By having what it takes<BR>
                      To carve a man-sized steak<BR>
                      With just a butter knife</P>
                    <P>And any back yard preacher with a barbecue<BR>
                      Can show the shortest route with just one hand<BR>
                      So every Sunday fool who strayed from Sunday school<BR>
                      To clean his swimming pool could understand</P>

                      The lines are always forming<BR>
                      The signs are always clear<BR>
                      There's not a trace of fear<BR>
                      If there's a blue light blinking<BR>
                      The parish pawns aren't thinking<BR>
                      They've replaced the cleric<BR>

                      We like to boast<BR>
                      There is most certainly<BR>
                      A K-Mart close at hand<BR>
                      We make a stand<BR>
                      Live day to day<BR>
                      And if we need another stray part<BR>
                      There will surely be a K-Mart on the way</P>
                    <P>And there are school yard dealers<BR>
                      In towns the maps forgot<BR>
                      You place a call and psychic healers<BR>
                      Put out all their psychic feelers<BR>
                      In the parking lot<BR>
                      And when the pavement's hot<BR>
                      If you can hitch a ride<BR>
                      You go to buy ad infinitum<BR>
                      Touch and try out every item<BR>
                      Just to stay inside</P>
                    <P>And any loser with a licence<BR>
                      And boozer with a cause<BR>
                      Will be anything but lost<BR>
                      Every town is just the same<BR>
                      It it's Broadway or it's First Street<BR>
                      Or it's Main Street or it's Church Street<BR>
                      The only thing that's different is the name</P>
                    <P>We live forever<BR>
                      We get to play<BR>
                      It is our destiny that calls<BR>
                      In Texas twangs and southern drawls<BR>
                      And when they tear apart the malls<BR>
                      The K-Marts stay<BR>
                      We foot the bills<BR>
                      We show no fear<BR>
                      And when more settlers come our way<BR>
                      Start making plans for extra K-Marts over here</P>
                    <P>And the churches were all empty<BR>
                      And the city streets were cleared<BR>
                      With all God's speed<BR>
                      For the Lord will lead all humans<BR>
                      To the store where all consumers<BR>
                      Go to feed<BR>

                      Jumps in the car and goes to make<BR>
                      The K-Mart home<BR>
                      We've on our knees<BR>
                      We're well behaved<BR>
                      And when it comes to judgement day<BR>
                      Smart people know that all the K-Marts<BR>

                      You think I'm under<BR>
                      Some kind of magical spell<BR>
                      You shave, You shower<BR>
                      It's such a packaging ploy<BR>
                      You crave the power<BR>
                      That comes from being a boy</P>
                    <P>What do you say to bedroom<BR>
                      Just put away your bedroom<BR>
                      I'll never stay with bedroom eyes<BR>
                      The end begins with bedroom<BR>
                      You'll never win with bedroom<BR>

                      While the dog is quickly cooking in the car</P>
                    <P>At the restaurant, The Family Restaurant<BR>

                      It's the spam of the cheeses, It's sure to appease<BR>
                      It's Velveta<BR>
                      Just the name brings the tears to my eyes<BR>
                      It's Velveta<BR>
                      It's like cheese with a perfect disguise<BR>
                      <BR>
                      For a cobbler and a tart<BR>
                      For a sherbet that the waitress recommends<BR>
                      For a Shirley-temple toast<BR>
                      To the chefs we like to think of as our friends<BR>
                      Filled with nausea and the knowledge<BR>
                      That there's money left for college<BR>
                      For the price what more could any family want<BR>

                      Thinking that they might enjoy the view<BR>

                      Nothing worse than being nauseous<BR>

                      At the foot of the hills<BR>
                      It grew brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter<BR>
                      Men with machines<BR>
                      Building walls in the weeds<BR>
                      It grew higher and higher and higher and higher<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Father was silent<BR>
                      He pulled up the blind<BR>
                      And said boys mark my words<BR>
                      It's the end of mankind<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Father died broken<BR>
                      A man of belief<BR>
                      Winter brought frostbite<BR>
                      Famine and grief<BR>
                      But there was light<BR>
                      We always could see<BR>
                      To lead us back home<BR>
                      To set us all free<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Then God made malls<BR>
                      And we were saved<BR>
                      The hills were plowed<BR>
                      And fields were paved<BR>
                      We found a place<BR>
                      To kneel and pray<BR>
                      With B. Dalton books<BR>
                      And Bon Marche<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Oh yeah....ooooo<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      When we were small<BR>
                      We could not see<BR>
                      Father had left<BR>
                      In our hour of need<BR>
                      God gave us family<BR>
                      Then taketh away<BR>
                      The devil brought freedom<BR>
                      With each shopping day<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Then came the light<BR>
                      With he sale of the day<BR>
                      It grew cheaper<BR>
                      Designer names<BR>
                      And video games<BR>
                      We sank deeper....ooo<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Father forgive us<BR>
                      We know that we've strayed<BR>
                      We were losing our will<BR>
                      We were lost and afraid<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      Then God made malls<BR>
                      And we were saved<BR>
                      The hills were plowed<BR>
                      And fields were paved<BR>
                      We found a place<BR>
                      We could just sit<BR>
                      With Penneys and Sears<BR>
                      And Spencer Gifts<BR>
                      &nbsp;<BR>
                      When we were small<BR>
                      Life was complete<BR>
                      Wandering and waiting<BR>
                      In pastures of meat<BR>
                      Little to do<BR>
                      Little to wear<BR>
                      Mornings for stores<BR>
                      Evening for prayer<BR>

                      We set out the plates<BR>
                      We get out the dinners<BR>

                      Just passionate kisses and passive restraints<BR>
                      It's so delicious the way that the Mrs.<BR>
                      Dismisses her worries and hides her complaints<BR>
                      I like the Mrs. at family Christmas<BR>
                      When family dishes are left for the night<BR>

                      We're never suspicious<BR>
                      Not me and the Mrs.<BR>

                      She could save the women's face<BR>

                      And the streets are always empty<BR>
                      And I'm never even tempted<BR>
                      When I'm window shopping<BR>
                      And the stores are never open<BR>
                      And the folks are walking blind<BR>
                      And I've come to know the neighborhood<BR>
                      I'll never leave behind</P>
                    <P>Oh I never feel the danger<BR>
                      When I come across a stranger<BR>
                      If he's twice my size, then he's twice my size<BR>
                      And I'll ask for a direction<BR>
                      Just to see my own reflection<BR>
                      In his sleepy eyes<BR>
                      There's a wind that blows the papers<BR>
                      There's a pile at my feet<BR>
                      It's an early morning barrier<BR>
                      To anyone I meet</P>
                    <P>You can join me in the darkness<BR>
                      You can watch me from the car<BR>
                      There's a lot of peace and quiet in the air tonight<BR>
                      And we'll be making fun<BR>
                      Making fun of foreigners</P>
                    <P>There's a lot of time for dreaming<BR>
                      When the sidewalk isn't teaming<BR>
                      And I'm window shopping, I go window shopping<BR>
                      And the discount stores are warring<BR>
                      And the gutter men are snoring<BR>
                      And I think of stopping, but I'm window shopping<BR>
                      There's a lot of secret pleasure<BR>
                      When a stranger takes a dive<BR>
                      And the traffic turns the corner<BR>
                      And the city comes alive</P>
                    <P>And the misery love company<BR>
                      And the tempers sometimes flare<BR>
                      You can see the troubled faces in the morning light<BR>
                      You can follow close behind me<BR>
                      We can travel half awake<BR>
                      And we'll be making fun<BR>
                      Making fun of foreigners</P>
                    <P>I can lose myself in street lamps<BR>
                      They've been swallowed by the twilight<BR>
                      And I look the strangers right between the eyes<BR>
                      I've got nothing else to do when I'm alone<BR>
                      All these wonderful distractions right at home</P>
                    <P>Sometimes there's a morning<BR>
                      When the streets are almost silent<BR>
                      I walk slowly, I walk slow<BR>
                      And with nowhere else to go<BR>
                      I head back with no direction<BR>
                      Having made a new connection with the flow<BR>
                      Making fun, making fun of foreigners<BR>
                    </P>
