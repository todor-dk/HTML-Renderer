 <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
 Cable News Network (CNN) ranks as one of the most important, indeed 
 perhaps the most important, innovation in cable television during 
 the final quarter of the 20th century. In 1984 CNN first began to 
 earn wide-spread recognition and praise for its nearly around the 
 clock coverage of the Democratic and Republican conventions. By 
 1990 Ted Turner's 24 hour-a-day creation had become the major source 
 for breaking news. Praise became so routine that few were surprised 
 when a mid-1990s Roper survey found viewers ranked CNN as the "most 
 fair" among all TV outlets, and the Times Mirror's Center for The 
 People & The Press found viewers trusted CNN more than any television 
 news organization. </font></P>
 <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
 success did not come overnight. Launched in June 1980 by the then 
 tiny Turner Broadcasting of Atlanta, in the beginning CNN (mocked 
 as the "Chicken Noodle Network") accumulated losses at the rate 
 of $2 million a month. Ted Turner transferred earnings from his 
 highly profitable superstation to slowly build a first rate news 
 organization. CNN set up bureaus across the United States, and then 
 around the world, beginning with Rome and London. Yet at first Turner 
 and his executives were never sure they would even survive the stiff 
 competition from rival Satellite NewsChannel, a joint venture of 
 Group W Westinghouse and ABC. In January 1982 Turner let Satellite 
 News Channels know he was serious and initiated a second CNN service, 
 "Headline News." Through 1982 and most of 1983 CNN battled SNC. 
 In October 1983 ABC and Westinghouse gave up and sold their news 
 venture to Turner for $25 million, ending effective competition 
 for CNN in the United States. </font></P>
 <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CNN 
 then took off. By 1985 it was reaching in excess of 30 million homes 
 in the United States and had claimed its first profit. Turner added 
 bureaus in Bonn, Moscow, Cairo and Tel Aviv, and in the years before 
 Court TV alone televised celebrated trials such as the Claus von 
 Bulow murder case. In 1987 when President Ronald Reagan met Mikhail 
 S. Gorbachev at a summit that would signal the end of the Cold War, 
 CNN was on the air continuously with some seventeen correspondents 
 on site. By 1989 CNN had 1600 employees, an annual budget was about 
 $150 million, and was available in 65 countries with such specialized 
 segments such as a daily entertainment report,<i> Show Biz Today</i>, 
 and a nightly evening newscast, <i>The World Today</i>. Larry King 
 had moved his interview show to CNN and become famous for attracting 
 ambitious politicians and infamous celebrities. In 1991, as the 
 only TV network in the world operating live from the very beginning 
 of Operation Desert Storm, CNN reported everything the military 
 permitted--from the first bombing of Baghdad to the tank blitz that 
 ended the conflict. Indeed at a press conference after the initial 
 air bombing runs by the U.S. Air Force, Defense Secretary Richard 
 B. Cheney and General Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
 of Staff, admitted that they were getting much of their war information 
 from CNN. </font></P>
 <P align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
 the fame of CNN's Gulf War coverage did not turn into corporate 
 fortune because the costs of coverage of a wide ranging set of battles 
 had risen faster than advertising revenues. Indeed the crest came 
 on the night of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq when CNN captured 
 11% of the audience as compared to the usual 1 or 2% normal audience 
 shares. Advertising time had already been sold. Still as the late 
 1980s and early 1990s provided regular disasters, wars, and "media 
 events," CNN was able to experience surges in interest and thus 
 take in ratings binges around the fascination peaked by the confrontations 
 at Tiananmen Square, the calamities of the San Francisco earthquake, 
 and the long awaited announcement of the verdict in O. J. Simpson's 
 "trial of the century." </font></P>

 <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whatever 
 the news mix, CNN's prestige never stopped rising. It became a basic 
 component of how the new global village communicated. So when United 
 States troops invaded Panama in 1989, the Soviet foreign ministry's 
 first call did not go to its counterpart in the United States diplomatic 
 corps, but to the Moscow bureau of CNN--a statement could be read 
 on camera condemning the action. Ted Turner proudly told anyone 
 who would listen that Margaret Thatcher, Francois Mitterrand, Nancy 
 Reagan, and Fidel Castro all had declared themselves faithful viewers 
 of CNN. But as CNN moved well past 50 million households reached 
 in the United States (and millions more abroad), all was not calm 
 inside the organization. Staffers began to grumble about low wages 
 and pressure not to unionize. And by the early 1990s Ted Turner 
 seemed to lose his innovative magic. In 1992 he heralded and launched 
 an "Airport Channel," and a "Supermarket Channel," but neither added 
 much in the way of new audience or profits. And as CNN reached over 
 more and more of the world, indigenous local news organizations 
 began to publicly label Ted Turner a "cultural imperialist." </font></p>
 <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yet 
 there was no doubt that as CNN turned fifteen in June 1995 it had 
 surely become a prosperous and important part of the new world of 
 cable television. Yearly revenues neared one billion dollars, but 
 growth stalled as advertisers realized that the CNN audience was 
 "too old" and "not as affluent" as could be found elsewhere. The 
 year 1995 was most eventful. First Ted Turner sold his complete 
 operation, including CNN, to mega-media giant Time Warner and skeptics 
 grumbled that a serious news organization would have difficulty 
 trying to function as part of such a corporate colossus. At the 
 end of the year Microsoft announced it would ally with NBC to form 
 MSNBC to directly challenge CNN. Rupert Murdoch's News Corps., Inc., 
 and Capital Cities/ABC also promised future 24-hour news services 
 to contest CNN around the world. Whatever the future held by the 
 mid-1990s CNN had become the stuff of legend. Ted Turner had forever 
 changed the history of television news with his innovation of CNN.
