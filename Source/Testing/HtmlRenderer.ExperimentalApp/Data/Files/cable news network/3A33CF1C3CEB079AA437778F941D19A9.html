		<p>One of the most closely observed—and powerful—figures in the news business, Fox News Channel President Roger Ailes, is the subject of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/business/media/biography-casts-critical-light-on-fox-news-chief.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/business/media/biography-casts-critical-light-on-fox-news-chief.html', 'a 560-page biography');">a 560-page biography</a> being released today. Even before its publication, “The Loudest Voice in the Room” by journalist <a href="http://www.gabrielsherman.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gabrielsherman.com/', 'Gabriel Sherman');">Gabriel Sherman</a> has triggered jousting matches between Ailes’ legions of critics and defenders.</p>
<p>Whatever one’s view of Ailes, it is undeniable that he has turned the 17-year-old Fox News Channel into a powerhouse that dominates the cable news ratings and wields substantial power in the world of conservative politics. Below are five facts about the organization that changed the face of cable news:</p>
<p> <big class="honkin-number" id="number-1">1</big><b>Fox News was very tough on the last Democratic candidate for president. (But MSNBC was even tougher on the Republican). </b>During the late stages of the 2012 presidential campaign, a <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2012/11/01/coverage-candidates-media-sector-and-cable-outlet/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.journalism.org/2012/11/01/coverage-candidates-media-sector-and-cable-outlet/', 'Pew Research analysis');">Pew Research analysis</a> found that Barack Obama received far more negative coverage than positive on the Fox News Channel. Yet Fox found its ideological mirror image in MSNBC. In the final stretch of the campaign<ins cite="mailto:bdrake" datetime="2014-01-14T10:13">,</ins> nearly half (46%) of Obama’s coverage on Fox was negative, while just 6% was positive in tone. But MSNBC produced an even harsher narrative about the Republican in the race: 71% of Romney’s coverage was negative, versus 3% positive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.journalism.org/2012/11/01/coverage-candidates-media-sector-and-cable-outlet/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.journalism.org/2012/11/01/coverage-candidates-media-sector-and-cable-outlet/', '');"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/legacy/u29/14-Tone_of_Coverage_on_Cable_News.png" alt="" width="674" height="399" /></a><span id="more-253311"></span></p>
<p> <big class="honkin-number" id="number-2">2</big><b>The Fox News audience skews more ideological than that of its two main competitors.</b> Fully, 60% of Fox News viewers describe themselves as conservative, compared with 23% who say they are moderate and 10% who are liberal, according to a 2012 <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/', 'survey by the Pew Research Center');">survey by the Pew Research Center</a>. By contrast, the ideological makeup of CNN viewers (32% conservative, 30% moderate, 30% liberal) and MSNBC viewers (32% conservative, 23% moderate, 36% liberal) is far more mixed.</p>

<p> <big class="honkin-number" id="number-3">3</big><b>Fox News is expensive. </b>If you’re a cable subscriber, you pay roughly 89 cents per month for the Fox News Channel, based on 2012 estimates provided by the industry research firm SNL Kagan. Cable channels generate much of their revenue from “license fees” they receive from cable companies in exchange for carriage in households. Those fees are passed along in subscribers’ monthly cable bills. Fox has <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/as-fox-news-channel-enters-new-round-of-carriage-negotiations-it-sets-its-sights-on-espn_b42972" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/as-fox-news-channel-enters-new-round-of-carriage-negotiations-it-sets-its-sights-on-espn_b42972', 'aggressively negotiated');">aggressively negotiated</a> its license fees, and now claims one of the highest average rates per subscriber. Only six non-premium cable channels command higher fees than Fox. CNN, by contrast, is estimated to average 57 cents per subscriber per month and MSNBC, 18 cents.</p>
<p> <big class="honkin-number" id="number-4">4</big><b>Fox still leads in audience, but that audience is smaller than it used to be.</b><br />
In 2013, Fox’s prime-time viewership declined 6% from the previous year, according to median monthly viewership data provided by Nielsen Media Research. But with 1.7 million viewers each evening, the channel still drew a bigger audience than CNN, MSNBC and HLN combined. Fox surpassed then-leader CNN in prime-time viewership in 2002, and has never looked back. However, there is some evidence of a ceiling for audience growth. Fox has not increased its median evening viewership since 2009.</p>

In 2012, the channel was estimated by SNL Kagan to spend $820 million—on everything from salaries for on-air talent to maintaining bureaus and keeping the lights on.

					<p>USA closed society news only what &#8221;establishment &#8221; wants &#8230;.  USA 2016 election, thanks to Trump the absolute corruption of the US government system is shown.<br />
Colorado protest because the GOP party said their puppet cruz had a landslide victory in Colorado people in Colorado did not vote at all  delegates in the GOP party that were for Trump were told they were not allowed to vote sent home.  Those lifelong republican party members burn their membership papers on YOU TUBE.  US news media will not cover protest or GOP corruption we US people are trapped Guardian must cover.</p>

					<p>After reading many comments about whats being said this cable news tells the truth and this one doesn&#8217;t and the spread hate etc. I can&#8217;t tell if people are being sarcastic or straight up. It&#8217;s crazy. Your talking about 1 news channel that came along 20 some years ago. If so many watch it more than the others COMBINED it should tell you something. Except for a couple national radio show. The left has had everything until fox ? Most national radio, print and cable news has always been left slanted. Thats how journalist are indoctrinated at college. It&#8217;s what there taught to believe. Use several sources to acquire your news. Want to try some real biased news try RT, wow they just shock me.</p>

					<p>Reason for Fox viewership decline? Rise in left leaning OPed plain and simple. It&#8217;s no secret the silent majority rules the USA but simply hasn&#8217;t been involved in recent years. Trump has awoken the sleeping giant!</p>

					<p>Dear America if you want real unbiased news, you will not find it ANY one place, you will have to fact check it all. I&#8217;m not saying spend all your free time researching the news, but if you find some subject compelling and have a strong opinion, you are not serving your best interest looking to one source of news.</p>
<p>ALL of the news is biased because it is people, of many differing opinions who report it. Learn that when something is reported as fact it is your responsibility to vet that by reading differing views and multiple sources. To say that Fox or MSNBC or any &#8220;network&#8221; always does anything is narrow minded and not in your or America&#8217;s best interest.</p>
<p>Adelaide Stevenson, a democrat if it matters to you, as an independent I don&#8217;t care who said it, I agree anti-intellectualism is a grave issue facing our country, said &#8220;Unreason and anti-intellectualism abominate thought. Thinking implies disagreement; and disagreement implies nonconformity; and nonconformity implies heresy; and heresy implies disloyalty — so, obviously, thinking must be stopped. But shouting is not a substitute for thinking and reason is not the subversion but the salvation of freedom.&#8221;</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s funny how people react to facts .for an example when discussing politics among my left wing friends we would get into heated arguments about certain facts .when I couldn&#8217;t convince them I then asked them if 2 plus 2equals four and they said as long as it was a democrat or socialist saying it did then they would believe it .otherwise it could equal anything. Here in lies the problem ,when a couple of generation&#8217;s now have been led to believe that any info contrary to what they have been spoon fed are all lies you don&#8217;t have the capability to discern the truth from fiction .so keep on being nothing more than sponges for the left if you want .I on the other hand know that 2plus 2 equals 4.thank you very much .</p>

					<p>Fox News will go down in history as the most brazen propaganda machine, ever.  It&#8217;s diabolical.  This week for example, they had a story about how President Obama wants to allow Syrian refugees entry to the US, without any screening at all.  That&#8217;s  just preposterous.    There it was on Fox News.  And minutes later, the thick-headed, blue collar high school grads and mentally ill retired military watching Fox News began echoing the story on Facebook.  Utterly chilling.  Almost comedic. And truly, truly frightening.</p>

					<p>When has news become so political? When I was growing up, I was told that to be journalist you have to keep to the facts, has this changed that much in this day and age? This is the reason why I do not watch national news any more. (I still get national news, just through web sites that I know are trustworthy.) You want more factual news from a TV outlet? I find that the most trustworthy news outlet from TV is your local news, because they don&#8217;t have to worry about the opinions of the masses. They just have to worry about there local areas.</p>

					<p>The only show on fox I watch anymore is waters world just to see how stupid big city people are . All news on tv has an agenda . Keep the public arguing and in the dark . Brainwashed in public schools and indoctrinated in college . If this is all this life is about what a waste of good dirt . It&#8217;s time to get on our knees and take account of our lives.</p>

					<p>You&#8217;re joking right?  I was with you when you said that all organizations have an agenda but to say that public schools and college brainwash and indoctrinate is ridiculous?  Then&#8230; followed by getting down on our knees and take account of our lives? (you mean prayer and reflection?)  For one, prayer is the last thing that needs to happen since it doesn&#8217;t do anything other than make YOU feel better.</p>
<p>The news organizations are an abomination which is why I have a hard time watching them too.  What we need more of is public schools and colleges with better funding.  You shouldn&#8217;t have to be in debt for the rest of your lives after going to get educated.  </p>
<p>Stop blaming schools for everything &#8211; they are the most important part of every society and demand the most attention beyond anything else.  There the rich aholes are cutting spending in this sector.   Its to keep the public in the dark like you just complained about.</p>

					<p>lets understand the entrenchment of extreme politics in this country. The idea of the two party system was for balance. Balance that was supposed to put us in a compromise situation (somewhere near the middle) thus providing the best possible solutions to what sustains the country.<br />
     But now we have this extreme far right and far left battle that continues to further divide our country. This is not balance, it actually is the opposite, depending on who&#8217;s thumb is currently on the scales.</p>
<p>  What is best for the welfare of the country? Well I can tell you that it has to be a working society. Which we are not. manufacturing jobs have been lost we no longer make products. We are a service nation that promotes dependency.  People will continue to depend on tax payer dollars to live on,&#8230;&#8230;<br />
 but not just the people who are entitled.&lt;&#8212;-this is one of a series of issues that are closely reaching the point of no return<br />
  too many entitlements and abuses adds to and often equals no incentive. This spells big trouble for our dying economy. Laziness in this country is booming. Accountability should not have to go to court to determine.<br />
   Yes big corporations have also sucked the life out this country as well. MIDDLE ground is the place to start a fix. Career politicians are playing the American people as fools.<br />
   Far left is dangerous and self serving (our current leadership) Far right is dangerous and self serving (Ted Cruz)<br />
  sensible leadership can happen, Kennedy and Reagan are good examples. Even Bill Clinton was an economically fair president. Ditch the agenda&#039;s and legacies.<br />
    Obama is history and it has always been about his personal legacy. We need to move on from him (and the current state of America) rather quickly, but not to another extreme.</p>
<p>  Too late for an old guy like me&#8230; but you young (independent) folks need to get your country back. Find yourself a Kennedy and get him elected.</p>

					<p>I have no idea how a two party system was supposed to ever balance anything.  And how was it supposed to provide, &#8220;&#8230;the best possible solutions to what sustains the country.&#8221;?</p>
<p>Of course having a society that allows every member to do their part, but those that CAN&#8217;T should be supported by a WELFARE SYSTEM!  What the hell are you talking about when you mention entitlements? Where do you get this whole rant on &#8220;laziness&#8221;? </p>
<p>Do you not realize that your rant about how we&#8217;ve lost all manufacturing jobs is almost entirely the fault of corporate greed and the fact that our representatives have NEVER represented us?  How can you be so blind to this?  Corporations lobby to avoid paying any penalties for any wrong doing, they would pay us working class next to nothing if they could (and they CAN, how do you think we can get a T-shirt for 4 dollars?!) and if you think I&#8217;ve absolved the rest of us of any wrong doing then you&#8217;re wrong.  &#8220;We&#8221; Americans need to stop buying crap that&#8217;s made in very poor countries (i.e. Indonesia, African countries, China, Bangladesh, India, etc).  Here we go, no laws to protect the individual workers often get paid somewhere around 50 cents an hour (on the high end).</p>
<p>Your complaint about entitlements and laziness is ridiculous.  We need a welfare program to protect the vulnerable, we need unions more than ever, we need minimum wages, we need affordable healthcare, we need affordable (or &#8220;free&#8221; paid through taxes) education.  These are entitlements are what get people working, and keep our economy going.  </p>
<p>So again&#8230; I have no idea what anyone on the conservative side is whining about when it comes to &#8220;entitlements&#8221; and calling super poor people lazy.   </p>
<p>Finally, I agree with you that this far left, far right battle gets ridiculous and very irrational, but please, point out one thing the &#8220;Far left&#8221; is self serving and dangerous?  Where is this happening? I&#8217;ve seen the far left say some pretty idiotic stuff before but has the far left attacked the EPA, or Planned Parenthood, or any other organization for completely unfounded reasons?  Or the fact that &#8220;they&#8217;ve&#8221; been attacking the Affordable healthcare Act since it was passed for completely ridiculous reasons rather than attempting to improve it?  Or their whole anti-marriage equality bs?  Or anti abortion, or anti contraception, or anti-school funding, or anti evolution.  It goes on and on.</p>
<p>Liberals however have their own idiotic problems like the creation of the term Islamophobia (as if being a Muslim is the same as being black &#8211; i.e. you can&#8217;t convert to being white or any other race.  You can convert  from or to Islam &#8211; of course apostasy carries a high price).  There&#8217;s more, I swear I&#8217;m trying to avoid bias as much as possible.</p>
<p>I do not deny that both parties have deep pockets to fill, and are being filled constantly, but I cannot possibly see anything good of coming from being a conservative.</p>
<p>Being a conservative is to NEVER view changes in a positive way.  Being a conservative seems to mean is to live in the dark ages.  Even when Republicans finally do something right (in Nebraska &#8211; abolishing the death penalty) the rest of the republican party latch on and attempt to revert back.  Its never ending.</p>

					<p>yea brad attacking entitlements is in the future gonna make sure the republicans never win another election its the rich aholes at the top keeping all the money that is screwing up are country not the people at the bottom the poor and disabled have nothing to do with it when the minimum wage goes up to pay workers just as much as the people at the top because they usually work harder or just as hard and deserve it prices go up not because of the wage increase but because the rich aholes that run the companies still want the same amount of money in there pockets even though there workers do just as much its rediculous a few rich a holes at the top hold a majority of the wealth in this country thats the biggest problem o and there only philosophy is to lower taxes for the rich and go into another war in the middle east its almost laughable anyone would vote for them</p>

					<p>Running on strict conservative principles is exactly how Republicans will forever win and win and win. The problem is not our principles and truth, but rather the failure of most candidates to run on true conservative principles. Until Trump that is! We all acknowledge he&#8217;s not the absolute perfect conservative but he&#8217;s the closest we&#8217;ve ever been! Aside from Cruz that is.</p>

					<p>I see constantly liberals claiming that fox has a lower truth reporting then Kenny, CNN and others. I disagree with that assessment. I do watch a mixture of fox, cnn, and  cbs and abc and nbc. I have detected a lack of truthfulness on the part of a few of these others, total lack of reporting anything that would make democrat look bad. Hillary&#8217;s testimony as an example main stream media is reporting that Hillary hit home run, and that republicans are making things up. Yet while watching her testimony I witness caught lying about the info in regards to what caused Benghazi. The proof is in the emails that she told the public it was the anti Muslim video that caused it, but at the same time was telling Egypt&#8217;s leaders that it was an attack by terrorist forces. Main stream media allowed this to get a pass then and now then is fast approaching an election that would quite possibly been adversely affected by that info. This not telling the truth and manipulating the public to vote the way they see fit. And doing so by unethical means, and very  possibly illegally. Yet Obama&#8217;s henchmen will not prosecute any thing to with a democrat being caught in illegal activity. This is just another step in the downfall of this country as without the press reporting truthfully without trying to manipulate the outcome of the vote, we no longer have a democracy, as next to follow will the punishing anyone how speaks out against the democrats, oh wait Louis Lerner and the IRS have already been doing that with out any punishment and still are. Thus we are living in a dictatorship</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve researched media bias at length. One difference in research methods is that one side tends to focus more on audience&#8211;which to me lacks rigor&#8211;and the other looks at more decisive information, such as donation amounts. </p>
<p>The results are much clearer with the latter, but many organizations have banned donations now. Looking at what is actually reported is far more difficult, and requires an extremely sensitive ear.</p>

					<p>Fox has a high level of watchers, to be sure, however it seems all who are conservative prefer Fox, whereas moderates, liberals, progressives have NPR, CNN, MSNBC, BBC, etc. to watch. Therefore, the high numbers of FOX viewers absolutely does not mean they are a majority of viewers overall. I watch FOX at least an hour a week; I do not want to criticize that which I do not know. Their level of &#8220;truthiness&#8221; is consistently low and, if this is a viewer&#8217;s PRIMARY news source (Bo Carter, Chris Allen), they should remember that FOX is feeding ignorance rather than feeding information (this is a moderate, business-oriented  source); <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/extended-exposure-to-fox-news-may-be-detrimental-to-your-intelligence-2010-12" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.businessinsider.com/extended-exposure-to-fox-news-may-be-detrimental-to-your-intelligence-2010-12', 'businessinsider.com/extended-exp&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">businessinsider.com/extended-exp&hellip;</a> . If you watch FOX, please also watch another channel once in a while, and do check sources.</p>

					<p>A recent study has indicated that Fox News viewers are the least informed viewers of any population segment, even less informed that those who pay no attention to the news at all.  It is little more than info-tainment.  They may as well just watch what used to be called World Wide Wrestling, they probably think that is real too.</p>

					<p>Most people watch the news channel that tells them what they want to hear.  Fox employs those of both parties.  Therefore I suppose it&#8217;s who you listen to there &#8211; Juan Williams who is on a lot  is a staunch Democrat.  His son however is Republican .  Alan Colmes is on  and he is staunch Democrat.  I believe most are Democrats but not sure about that.  Shepard Smith, Democrat, is also on Fox.</p>

					<p>i will not watch any other news media other than fox. I use to watch cnn till Pearce Moron came on the air with his bias stupid views on gun control. I switched channel to fox and never looked back. The rest of the so called news channels are totally bias left wing democratic socialist that spew warped opinions of the news. Not worth your time.</p>

					<p>You should invest a lot of time in fact checking if you plan on using Fox News for your only source of news, there is a ton of data out there showing they rarely actually have any proof supporting their agenda, just a bunch of rhetoric</p>

					<p>Why does Fox RARELY have any guests who are pro-choice on abortion as opposed to the CONSERVATIVE point of view on abortion (pro life)?  I&#8217;ve noticed they (the guests, and CERTAINLY NEVER the Fox news people themselves) almost NEVER intelligently debate on the matter of being pro-choice&#8230;and why is that????  Why is Fox sooooo afraid of intelligent debate on this particular subject?  Is it that they want to systematically BRAINWASH all their viewers into THINKING ONE WAY and ONE WAY ONLY, which is THE FOX WAY?</p>

					<p>Because it is their way of being ineffective.<br />
The unfortunate truth is that all major news outlets offer opinion as fact more than half the time.<br />
Having guests with week debating skills or talking points and even cherry picking &#8220;prominent figures&#8221; or &#8220;average people&#8221; who&#8217;s views align with theirs works for their agenda.<br />
Again this goes for all major news networks. MSNBC, CNN, Fox, NBC and so on.</p>

					<p>I don&#8217;t think you watch Fox at all. You read that. I&#8217;ve heard from many pro-choice liberals on panels on this topic. Has CNN ever had a pro-life conservative on -to make their case? While I watch CNN only occasionally, I&#8217;m willing to bet it&#8217;s 10:1 the other way. Fox News has all KINDS of liberals on, every day. I don&#8217;t know where you get that information. CNN only has &#8220;mystery conservatives&#8221; on no one has ever heard of. On panels, liberals outnumber conservatives 3 or 4 to one on CNN, and it&#8217;s 10x as bad on MSNBC.</p>

					<p>Remember this is a republican city mostly, but that&#8217;s not the point, and it&#8217;s to their advantage they have latino viewers as well as themselves. Do I have to spell it out to you guys? The first thing I do is turn to the fox5 news, not knowing that they were republican, and only because of the people. Now I do view, from time to time CBS NEWS 8, why to support them as well, they&#8217;re Democrats, and so am I. Remember they monitor your signal from cox cable, if you&#8217;re subscribing from them, they&#8217;re republicans too, that&#8217;s how they see they&#8217;re ratings, by you the viewers. Remember they say their viewers are declining, it&#8217;s only a trick to make you feel bad for them, they don&#8217;t want to lose you as a viewer, their the main corporate offices are back east, they&#8217;re a huge organization, and been around a long time. They chose to be natural and not give an opinion, but give the NEWS, watch CBS NEWS 8.</p>

					<p>You obviously do not watch enough Fox News. Your comment is far from the truth. I watch Fox in addition to CNN and believe Fox is more trustworthy and clearly have a variety of opinionated guests, its too bad most liberal guests decline invites to express their ill way of thinking.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m a moderate/conservative and I find it interesting that the majority of your comments here, are negative about Fox News. The people that do the evening news are highly intellectual people&#8211;unlike some of the others. I believe your company gravitates towards being bias.</p>

					<p>In their own way, they&#8217;re all just as bad as the other. I also know, that a lot of your research info comes from very liberal backgrounds. Everyone has their quotas to meet and the big man is telling them what to say and not say&#8230;</p>

					<p>If anyone wants real, unbiased news, your best bet is your local news outlet and avoid the national news. Also, independent news is good, too. I find my local news if i want to watch any news on tv is probably the best source. I use to be an avid fox news viewer,  until one day something &#8216;clicked&#8217; and i saw it for the ridiculous, propaganda machine it was. I don&#8217;t watch CNN or the others, i assume fox is on par with them. I get annoyed with fox &#8216;news&#8217; slogan of: &#8220;fair and balanced &#8220;. What a load of crap!</p>

					<p>morning joe is the only msnbc show I can watch and even then all their guests are liberals and give these crazy skewed views. mikas father when he is a guest often has the only view worth considering .  wish they would give some real analysis.  fox news in the morning hardly gives news instead you get stories about high school bands or what must pass as human interest stories. what are these people thinking</p>

					<p>It is very sad how fox so called news lies to their veiwers&#8230;.most are old,white, with very low education..and fox know it that is why they say and report bunch of garbage to them.  Make them think that Obama is a black monster who is after them and their guns so on and so on&#8230;.the worst part is that they really  take it all in&#8230;.then turn that into hatred of the black race&#8230;very</p>

					<p>Debbie, actually it&#8217;s true. The majority of faux news audience is old, white folks. The age range is 60+. Google fox news audience age and you&#8217;ll see.</p>

					<p>Debbie, I&#8217;m coming straight from the Fox news comments section. And while Fox may not be &#8220;causing hatred,&#8221; it is certainly giving hatred free range on its comments boards.</p>

					<p>Question on point 3:  Where I live direct tv and Dish are the satellite providers.  Fox news is free with the lowest package.   If you want MSNBC or CNN you go up a level so it costs more for me to watch or have a variety of news channels.  There have been times when I could only afford Fox news.  Also, those businesses that give you TV almost always they have only FOX news because they have their FOX  sports bundle.  Not sure about Cable companies. Wondering if when they compare ratings if this is taken into consideration?  Not exactly apples to oranges for us poor folk.</p>

					<p>I am an independent, I have voted for just as many republicans as I have democrats. I prefer news outlets that just report the facts with as little bias as possible because news is at its core suppose to be such as I said. However, the bias isn&#8217;t what bothers me the most about FOX News (because everyone with half a brain knows and expects this network to be just an outlet for the Republican Party similar to Real Time and many shows on MSNBC are outlets of the left.). The issues I&#8217;ve always had with FOX in particular is they treat their watchers like they are idiots, every show is sprinkled with doom, innuendo that the democrats are the devil (and often more than just innuendo), and above all flat out lies. No other news channel lies like fox and that a fact.</p>

					<p>The trouble with jumping to conclusions is that after you jump to enough of them, you start to believe them.  Be objective, not subjective. Do some research, present some facts and go from there.  Fox news does tend to sensationalize some news events, but keep in mind that CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN all do the same, only from a liberal approach.  All of them take comments and news clips out of context and that bothers me the most.</p>

					<p>I have been told by some of my friends that Fox news is all lies. I asked for examples of lies so I could do research but they wouldn&#8217;t or couldn&#8217;t give any. If you can give examples so I can research them it would be appreciated.</p>

					<p>Robert L:  Exactly!  When blasting Democrats, Billow for one, opens his propaganda with such phrases as &#8220;Some say, It has been said, I believe&#8221; &#8216;etc.&#8217;, with nary a single verifiable citation to be found.  All night long!  At best they rely on Lush Limburger or Breitbart level references.  How often do they bow to a retraction?  Compared to Rachel Maddow, whom if in naming a person in office incorrectly in a story, that shares the exact same name as another, will not only retract that story, but correct it with explanation as to how the mix up occurred, with a deep apology.  Dare to compare!  They never do.</p>

					<p>It is really quite simple. As with most businesses it is about money. Fox viewership doesn&#8217;t want to hear about pro choice in general. They want to hear about pro life. so you give the audience what they want. It&#8217;s the exact same with MSNBC. They are ideological opposites. To get truly accurate unbiased news these days you have to turn to media outlets such as The Economist and the Wall Street Journal. Some say BBC news is extremely unbias as well. Fact is if anyone bases their &#8220;facts&#8221; off something MSNBC, ABC, FOX, CNN or NBC there is almost always a bias to it and can be argued by &#8220;facts&#8221; from one of the other major news outlets.</p>

					<p>Once Obama leaves office Fox News ratings will drop like a rock.  It will be much harder to scare their old, white audience about a Black President.  They will make up for it by scaring them about Blacks in general but it will not have as much impact.  Fox News is a cancer on the US.  They enjoy stoking racial hatred and fear in return for ratings.  </p>
<p>Judgement day will not be good to those who have created this cancer on the world called Fox News.</p>

					<p>Where do you get your news? Let me guess. Comedy Central and MSNBC. You liberals pit blacks against whites, old against young, rich against  poor, gays against straits. It is you that has a problem with a black president. You can&#8217;t except that he is an incompetent college professor with no real world experience. So you call people who disagree with his policies racist. It is you who are judging him by his color and not by is policies. You hate Fox News because they don&#8217;t support your worldview. </p>
<p>PS: give Al Sharpton a call, I&#8217;m sure he he will help you through this.</p>

					<p>There is nothing negative or judgmental about any party in these statistics.  The research actually said that MSNBC reported more negative information about Republicans than Fox news reported about Democrats.  So the Dems are doing more name calling and finger pointing that the Republicans.  Are you aware that the Pew Research Center is Nonpartisan? That means that there is no political affiliation whatsoever.  Try looking it up, it is not funded by Democrats or Republicans, it is just a statistical analysis of how the public views all sorts of issues.</p>

<p>No, that&#8217;s not what it said. It said that MSNBC reported more negative info about Romney than Fox did about Obama. But when you consider we are talking about Romney, what else would you expect.</p>

					<p>I want some proof of the lies. I hear Liberals spewing crap about Fox lies constantly, and they never show any proof of any lies. Just name calling. Just like kids in school when confronted with the truth they reply with name calling. Everything I see on Fox is backed up with actual video or quotes, and you can find most everything on Facebook or elsewhere if you bother to do any research. And they say, &#8220;We report, you decide&#8221;. I will admit, Liberal or Democrat or whatever, It is very hard to find the real truth on a lot of issues because of misleading information all over the place, backed by a politically motivad foundation or group. Like &#8220;Factcheck.org&#8221;. Run by liberals and even had Obama on the board several years ago.</p>

					<p>FactCheck is funded by the Annenberg foundation &#8230;. Very liberal I might add&#8230;&#8230; do you expect they are going to call themselves? Partisan left wing liars?</p>
<p>This is what these lefties do. It&#8217;s the same tactics Hitler and Stalin used with their propaganda. They create one fake source that endorses another fake source. They try to overwhelm you with so much propaganda that you won&#8217;t believe anything else because you hear their &#8220;truth&#8221; 24/7/365&#8230; so that means it must be true right? This is classic Marxist propaganda tactics. They have their bullshit all over the net.</p>
<p>But when you get to the bottom of these sites, you find out they are all funded by left wing political organizations.</p>
<p>This is their tactics. Flood the media with propaganda and demonize anyone who disagrees.</p>
<p>THINK FOR YOURSELF PEOPLE. Inform yourself. Don&#8217;t take my word for it and don&#8217;t take some Web site&#8217;s word for it. Inform yourself and use your own mind to determine what is true. An informed citizen in the left&#8217;s worst enemy.</p>

					<p>Good reply Ed. I&#8217;m not a conservative but have to agree that the left owns race baiting and hate-mongering. I can&#8217;t stand the sensationalistic negativity on Fox, but they do avoid the hate-mongering and class warfare constantly pushed by BOTH CNN and MSNBC. They are terribly a racist clan. No good, honest news sources to go to. I read The Guardian: less sensational and less racist. Left leaning, but hey&#8230; their socialists so I expect that.</p>

					<p>I don&#8217;t understand why liberals think that only white Anglo people watch Fox News. I am an American of Mexican descent who would rather watch Fox News than any of the liberal news outlets which are propaganda tools for the liberal mantra. Obama has hurt race relations in our country while he has been in office. I have never seen it this bad in my adult life. The cancer is CBS, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, and PBS; One giant malignancy.</p>

					<p>Fox News&#8217; viewership has already declined over the last several years.  However, Obama is not what fuels Fox News; it has been around since late 1996, almost 12 years before Obama was elected President.  I agree that Fox has gone too far to the right and is not &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; as it was in the beginning, but the other networks&#8217; news has been blatantly biased toward the left for many, many years.  I&#8217;ve never been able to stomach Sean Hannity, and that goes back to 1996 when he had a show on a local radio station here in Huntsville, AL.  He is an ass.  Then again so are Rachel Maddow and Al Sharpton, not to mention idiots that are (or were) on some of the other cable news stations-  e.g., Martin Bashir and Ronan Farrow.  Today&#8217;s news seems to be biased in one direction or the other, depending on the channel.   There is no such thing as &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; on any of the major newscasts anymore.</p>

					<p>Patrick, you did see in this article that FOX viewership surpassed that of then leader CNN in 2002, do you recall who was president at that time? yes, you would know him as a Republican White President. So I think There stands a good chance that FOX will still be #1 no matter how the 2016 elections go.</p>

					<p>Boomers and the WW 2 generation make up the main body of FOX viewers. Not that I am wishing ill on anyone but as these generations start to pass, FOX&#8217;s numbers will drop dramatically. Eventually it will go off the air like any other TV show when it&#8217;s ratings drop and don&#8217;t come back up. Really when one looks at it, if FOX has 1.5 to 2 million viewers per day that represents less than 1% of the adult population based on 2013 numbers of just over 240 million U.S. citizens over 18. When I realized this I stopped worrying that they were shaping the political and social viewpoints of the masses. FOX&#8217;s beginnings go back to Roger Ailes approaching then President Nixon with the proposal of starting a TV news channel for Republicans. It eventually morphed into what we know as FOX by the 1990&#8217;s. Calling it fair and balanced is of course ludicrous when given this fact. It&#8217;s an Echo Chamber for the very hardcore conservatives and that&#8217;s all it really is. As for the rest of the news outlets, calling them liberal is a bit of an archaic notion. Many are owned and controlled by large corporations or wealthy and powerful individuals. That has been the case for quite some time. These corporations and individuals will always filter what the masses perceive as news. If it&#8217;s not William Randolph Hearst lying to the public to get them involved in the Spanish American War in 1898, then it&#8217;s Rupert Murdoch advancing what ever his personal agenda is or GE who owns NBC, glorifying war reports because they are one of the main suppliers of weapons systems to our military.</p>

					<p>Not anymore. Fox News viewership has gone way up since this article was presented. They lead in all age groups. Google it.</p>
<p>CNN and MSNBC went into a sharp decline. The only people who still watch it are the ones who have yet to realize that liberal news is propaganda, and Fox News has become the closest thing to real news. They will publish articles that CNN is afraid to, because it does not fit CNN&#8217;s narrative.</p>
<p>Fox News is usually the number 2 to number 4 most watched cable channel, while MSNBC and CNN sit in the 30s. Both of them are losing a lot of money.</p>

					<p>All of what you say may be true which is why Fox Viewers are very misinformed. In every one of the last seven studies done all by nonpartisan independent study groups, Fox viewers were more misinformed on facts about current events and domestic and foreign policy. Fox viewers were dead last in every study so much so that people who didn&#8217;t get any news from any network were able to answer more questions correctly.</p>

					<p>My new &#8220;step-father&#8221; (of 3 years) is a FOX News Diehard.  He turns it on when he gets up in the morning, and he (now they) watch it continuously. It is all that is EVER on TV. He grew up in NAZI occupied Germany and is the most biased, negative, &amp; opinionated person I have ever met.  Convinced this country is following in the footsteps of Hitler, he has turned my once happy, dancing Mom into a gloom and doom monger.  All they talk about is how this country is doomed and how they are glad that when &#8220;the shit hits the fan&#8221; they will be dead.  He resents the fact that I collect Social Security Disability, says I live off the taxpayers backs.  (Excuse me, but I was and still am a taxpayer) Anyway, to make a long story short.  In my humble opinion, I feel that this news network corrupts the minds and souls of people in a very detrimental way.  He went to Germany last week and was gone for 8 days. My Mom somewhat returned to her former self, we actually watched a movie!  She seemed to have &#8220;lightened&#8221; up, he got back 3 days ago and she is back on gloom and doom mode, with him as a cheerleader! FOX News is broadcast on their 80&#8243; smart TV.  Why they bought a smart TV when they only watch one channel is beyond comprehension.<br />
I feel that he has literally &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; my Mom into HIS reality.  I came to this website and read the comments, hoping to hear stories similar in nature but I suppose my situation here is much more complicated than just blaming FOX News for their negativity.  I truly feel that it doesn&#8217;t help, That&#8217;s for Sure!  Any Opinions?  I would like to consider all sides in this matter.<br />

					<p>Bernadette,<br />
although my situation is not identical to yours, i believe that sharing to help. I have a step father-in-law, who is a fox news junkie&#8230;boomer, and has the most negative view on life. He went as far as calling my mother a devil worshiper because she was a dem. So i say this, you can only do so much, if the information they are giving out is unsolicited you need to ask them politely to stop. I suggest that you request that the topic of conversation not be doom and gloom when you are over there. perhaps that will help. I really try to avoid religion and politics with people like that. They can be real assholes when they want to be.</p>

					<p>Well deary, I really hate to break it to ya, but he lived in Nazi occupied Germany and he would see it coming better than most without even watching the news.  That isn&#8217;t even saying the fact that Hitler&#8217;s buddies run the media, banking system, etc. in this country and despite how much of a dick he was to non Zionist Jews, Russians, Polish, and the mentally ill, his policies were pretty left leaning.  Actually very left leaning.</p>
<p>He created socialized health, schooling, the works.  There is no wonder why he would see the red flags, because they are there.  I don&#8217;t even watch television and can see it flooding in from the views of left and right all over online.</p>

					<p>A lot of liberals watch Fox as well as msnbc.  To use &#8220;critical thinking&#8221; you need to see the opposite sides and extremes.  I am almost positive that the majority of conservatives could not find msnbc without a guide.  In Arlington TX they are 1210 and 1215 for HD. If you fall into this category as not using critical thinking&#8230;I challenge you to only watch msnbc for a week&#8230;detox 🙂</p>

					<p>Sorry to disappoint you, I watch ALL the news outlets, including MSNBC and<br />
C-Span, however, if you rely ONLY on television for your &#8220;news&#8221; you are not balanced in your personal views.  READING newspapers and magazines are critical as but let&#8217;s face it ABC, NBC and CBS are mainly &#8220;fluff&#8221;.  A person must evaluate his/her own stance and rely on the influence that good and evil may throw in.  When Hitler was on the rise in Germany the young especially, and all others, desired to acquire a &#8220;Daddy&#8221; who would &#8220;make everything right&#8221; within their nation.  Some of the population did so innocently, but most deliberately made a choice for Hitler.  The population was entranced and hypnotized by Hitler, completely blinded by his speeches and not noticing his actions.  We too must not be blinded, we must be vigilant, or we as a nation will be beguiled and pay the price in lives.</p>

					<p>Look at Pew&#8217;s numbers again, Terry&#8230;just the opposite of what you&#8217;re claiming.  Conservatives more evenly distributed in what they watch (about a third of CNN &amp; MSNBC viewers), while only about 10% of Fox viewers are liberals.</p>

					<p>Prejudice? I think you mean bias. Talk about snap judgements, so you decide what someone is like for watching Fox news. CNN is just as biased from a liberal point of view.</p>

					<p>I do not really watch the news, but if I did(its been about a year) it would be FOX. I read Drudge, and if something is interesting, try to learn more about it, since its just links to other sites. Just did the Pew Quiz on how much news I know, and made a 100%, so I think I&#8217;m covered.</p>

					<p>It is not tougher coverage. It is lies, lies and more lies. No, other TV channels don&#8217;t tell lies except the new one NEWSMAX which if following the same format as Fox.</p>
<p>Fox is not News. Fox is a propaganda machine for the Republican party . Pure and simple.</p>

					<p>Come on, CNN has been doing the liberal bias thing since the 70s.<br />
At least Fox backs up what is says with facts and deep analysis.<br />
Liberal media outnumbers conservative media by at least 10 to 1.<br />
Obama won by manipulating ignorant young people and minorities. Telling people what they wanted to hear, and he has not made life better for anyone except big bankers and liberal special interest groups. Get real man.</p>

					<p>Fox has liberals on their shows who offer balance. MSNBC has no real conservatives. If most Americans go there for news there is good reason. The Press was always suppose to be a watchdog on government. NBC/MSNBC/CNN have been lapdogs did they ask hard questions about Obama care, Fast and Furious, VA and IRS scandals? Current air traffic control hiring favoritism. Justice department hiding immigration facts?  Benghazi was whitewashed only Fox reported it at the time. Atkinson on CBS tried to tell the story and was fired.</p>

					<p>That is not the &#8220;liberal&#8221; that is spewing the left-sounding words. Those are totally scripted conversations that are conducted by trained actors. Did you think they were &#8220;journalists&#8221;? sheesh!</p>

					<p>What we need are options, voucher&#8217;s to send our kids to private a private school if we like, especially when the public schools in a area are failing. Competition for those dollars is whats needed.  MORE money, look at your property taxes for your home and see what schools get. Don&#8217;t forget matching federal dollars. Less waste is whats needed ! If you need a great example look at the New Orleans public, private schools voucher system, and how its doing. It was extended another 5 years due to its great success. All kids grades are up. Isn&#8217;t that what is all about?</p>

					<p>If they did it honestly it would be okay.<br />
They lie about Obama. Make up garbage and just tell out and out lies about Hillary, Obama, and Democrats. They then in turn try to make Republicans look good, by lying in their favor, which is getting harder and harder to do.<br />
i am for shutting Fox down permanently. I don&#8217;t know why Obama hasn&#8217;t done this. They are not performing a service for America which is a requirement to run a TV station. They are harming America and Americans.<br />
When they lie about stuff it keeps people from making the right choices in the polling places and even who to give money to. That is bad not good.People watch Fox to get their hate fix every day. They have to have their paranoid mania fed.  I have watched all of their stars lie almost daily. Yes, they know they are lying. But there is a feeding frenzy of hate that must be done daily.</p>

					<p>Honey in this country there is something called FREEDOM you obviously don&#8217;t believe in it. &#8220;Obama should shut it down.&#8221;Just because YOU and OBAMA  don&#8217;t believe in something, doesn&#8217;t mean it should be taken down. Politicians are there to represent the citizens of a country. If we go by that, then it&#8217;s CNN that should be taken down since it has less viewers. You&#8217;re better off living somewhere else where people are ALL FORCED to think the same way.</p>

					<p>Simply put. Fox news IS biased but I&#8217;m ok with that. All the other networks ARE biased as well. 90% of all media is biased towards a liberal/democrat point of view. I thank God that Fox is around as the minority in a country continuously and blindly following a left wing agenda that takes God out of it&#8217;s reasoning and political thought process. The mouthpiece of the beast is alive and well unfortunately.</p>

					<p>Fox evening programming only has one NEWS program&#8230;.which is very good.  The remaining are talk shows with different approaches and views on the news and/or other issues.  Comparing the talk show hosts to newscasts is really rather ridiculous.  Having said that, my problem with the mainstream media news is not lies by commission, but &#8216;lies&#8217; by omission and there is a lot of that.  If I don&#8217;t check with Fox news, or listen to some of the programs I would have missed or been way behind on numerous issues including Benghazi and others of import.</p>

					<p>You need to checkout Fox News with factcheck, they only check out the true facts about what people said and write.  If you are looking for the true facts you may be listening to the wrong program but they make it sound reliable until I check it out.</p>

					<p>You consider Benghazi important? Even Bill  O&#8217;Reilly said that Hillary Clinton had no security responsibilities for Benghazi. Security is the responsibility of the CIA and the military.</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan became the 40th President of the United States serving from 1981-1989. 1982 &#8211; President Ronald Reagan sent Marines to Lebanon on a peacekeeping mission. October 23, 1983 &#8211; At 6:22 am, a truck carrying 2000 pounds of explosives drove into the Marine compound in Beirut, Lebanon and crashed into the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regimental Battalion Landing Team barracks. 241 U.S. service personnel, 220 Marines and 21 other service personnel, are killed. Was this the fault of the Secretary of State at the time?</p>

					<p>Check out the interview fox did about a lady that went to school with Obama. It was<br />
on the Bill O&#8217; Rilly show if you are interested in the truth. This one must have slipped by fox editing department.  what ever happened to people like Walter Cronkite. He was the most trusted man in the news.  Just the facts. If I wanted a made up story I would read a novel.<br />
Most of these people wouldn&#8217;t want here what Jesus had to say. The truth is not very popular.</p>

					<p>In my opinion the FOX news personalities always seem angry and hateful.  I get that they don&#8217;t like our current president, but it seems like they go out of the way to report anything that wi&#8217;ll make  him look bad and not report any positive accomplishments.  Also, everything with them is either a &#8220;left&#8221;  view (negative) or a &#8220;right&#8221; view (positive).  There&#8217;s no compromise or in between with them.<br />
Then there&#8217;s the female anchors.  What&#8217;s up with the thigh shots and low cuts? They make the women seem like bimbos.<br />
I typically watch and listen to CNN.  But I do surf FOX and MSNBC.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah&#8230;can&#8217;t stand Hannity.</p>

					<p>Question: Why is FOX News so negative and bias?  Every time, I turn my station to FOX News, I have never heard the reporters providing the public with positive feedback.  It&#8217;s sad that you have a network of reporters who appear to be extremely angry at the world.  And yet, they (reporters) place blame on various issues that occur in the world.  The reporters of FOX News must analyze the actions of what they say and how they deliver messages before going on-air. I realize that most of the network are made up of conservatives, maybe this explains the anger of a network with no respect or self-worth.</p>

					<p>Leticia, they are not negative and bias. The truth hurts and the people and the president who are in power are a sad reflection of our society and where we are headed as a nation. I hope that you are not hypnotized by the powerful and deceitful influence of the people in power and follow them like a mindless animal following the herd. Just because most of the population is swaying one way and will continue to gain more followers does not make it the the correct choice but only the popular choice. Pray and meditate for your well being without any media/electronic influences and you will be able to make better choices and follow more positive thought patterns that are not misguided by the corrupted masses but guided by the part of the Spirit that our Father gave you. God Bless you!</p>

					<p>I see a great deal of  &#8220;Name Calling&#8221;  from the more liberal viewers, but, as with so many who resort to name calling -don&#8217;t bother to cite any facts about inaccuracy.  When it comes to news-Fox is by far the most trusted.  I think they confuse News with Opinion.</p>

					<p>Blatant stereotyping does not equal truth &#8211; from either political persuasion. Your comment is a blatant stereotype, is it not? You appear to be trying to win  an argument, truth be damned.  Can&#8217;t spell? Poor grammar? Perhaps you missed it, but we&#8217;re talking about politics &#8211; cease the debate 101 method of calling attention to your opponent&#8217;s spelling and let&#8217;s hear some input regarding the infinately more complex arena of political thought.</p>

					<p>Brian Williams&#8217; &#8220;lie&#8221; was something never said on the air&#8230;but 10 years later on the David Letterman show, that his helicopoter had been &#8220;shot down&#8221;     The helicopter in FRONT of his was &#8220;shot down&#8221; by a rocket propelled grenade.  The helicopter Williams was on was under attack by machine guns from the ground,  but landed rather than crashed, so it was &#8220;forced down.&#8221;  Williams was suspended by NBC for 6 months without pay.</p>
<p>Bill O&#8217;Reilly said ON HIS OWN SHOW that he was in &#8220;active war zones&#8221; in the Falklands in 1982. He reported on the rebuilding AFTER THE WAR ENDED.   He said he survived a &#8220;combat situation in Argentina.&#8221; Never.  He said he &#8220;saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.&#8221; No.  Said he was knocking on the front door of a JFK assassination figure when the man killed himself.  He was 1200 miles away when it happened.   </p>
<p>Williams apologized, is off the air and remains publicly silent.  O&#8217;Reilly remains on the air, has the full support of Roger Ailes, and continues to  threaten journalists writing about him.</p>
<p>Fox News people can do things much worse than things that genuine MSM people are suspended or fired for,  but are allowed to remain on the air and use air time to smear the people who expose their wrongdoing.</p>

					<p>4-17-15.  I turned in to Fox news for Megin Kelly recently and they showed the identical films they had showed yesterday as though it was current news.  It was the same clips!.  I&#8217;m done with watching them.  They are not showing objective news.  They are showing what they think is the news and try to persuade me not what I consider news.  Instead of tragedy after tragedy, why not show some good news.?  Are they out of news investigators?  Give me some happy news!!!!</p>

					<p>Measuring negative comments is one thing.  Measuring their impact is another. </p>
<p>Just as marketing is not equally effective not all negative comments have the same impact. </p>
<p>Fox&#8217;s use of fear to divide (us vs. them) their &#8220;believers&#8221; from others &#8212; makes their rhetoric more effective and reduces the need for negative comments.  (Viewers, as &#8220;us&#8221;, are much more likely to believe the narratives that they put forward and are much more likely to dismiss narratives put forward by others.)</p>

					<p>CNN in 2015 has become a tabloid news outlet.  It&#8217;s not what they report, so much, as how they report it and more importantly what they DON&#8217;T report.  To try and get factual news with no bias is difficult these days. Seems like they all have a political &#8220;brainwashing agenda&#8221; for the people who don&#8217;t work at seperating the facts from the one-sided sensationalism.  It&#8217;s sad. So lets not call it news anymore,  just call them political persuasion channels and demand a channel that actually wants to report all the factual news with no bias.</p>

					<p>All of the stations have turned into tabloids yet the other stations have Al Sharpton with his racist filters on everything that happens to Blacks in America.</p>
<p>The liberals are so generous with other people&#8217;s money &#8211; they should dig themselves out and support who they want and not force others to support people who choose to riot, stay on welfare, not work, fail in education defer having kids and think that the workers should support their poor choices.</p>

					<p>I take consolation in the fact reported here that Fox News maybe gets  only 2 million viewers in prime time. Given the US population is roughly 330 millions folks as I write this, it means for every dedicated Fox news acolyte viewing  it, there are 164 persons who are not.  Simply put,  99.4 percent of Americans , some 328 million people, never watch Fox News. Perhaps we give them too much credit/discredit here, when in fact their viewership is between Slim, and Next to None.</p>
<p>Of course, that fact will never be reported on Fox&#8230;</p>

					<p>I still watch Fox news but just wish they would report the facts and leave their opinions to themselves.  I also watch CNN and they do the same thing . Whatever happened to reporting the FACTS the TRUTH without all the opinions and trying to sway or brain wash their audience ? Do they really believe we are so dumb we can not take the facts and form our own opinion? News is not what it used to be mainstream news now is all about who can get the best ratings and over inflate each situation they report on it is getting really old. I believe a new news channel needs to start that is not right wing or left wing they are just Americans that love this country and want to see honest news being reported without any hidden agenda. I would NEVER go back to Fox , CNN, MSNBC or any of those slanted reporting agency that is just concerned about ratings and their careers and do not care about the truth.  If we had just one news reporting agency that we could trust and had no agenda other than reporting the truth  I would never watch the other channels.</p>

					<p>Fox news is like pro wrestling; everyone knows it&#8217;s fake, they&#8217;re lying and most of it isn&#8217;t real but we still have to watch occasionally.</p>

					<p>I used to watch Fox news faithfully, but I can no longer. It is so bias, I had tune them out. The hate for our President shows through. I check back once in a while to see if anything has changed and it has not. Neither conservatives or liberals are right or wrong all the time.</p>

					<p>You don&#8217;t like Fox, fine don&#8217;t watch it.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s really as simple as that. As far as news not being opinion, there is bias all over the news. MSNBC is very biased, so is CNN. But, then again, so is ABC, CBS and NBC &#8211; extraordinarily so, especially how they make choices on what to cover. Heck, Pew is very biased to the left &#8211; </p>
<p>But, viewers can make their own choices on what to watch.  The Fox derangement syndrome here and elsewhere (many from &#8220;former viewers&#8221; &#8211; yeah SSSUUURREE) makes me wonder if these people would be comfortable banning Fox News, or requiring that it identify itself as having one ideology or another.</p>
<p>In short if you believe Fox News should be taken off the air, then you should re-examine your view of yourself as a live and let live open minded liberal. But that is a digression&#8230;.</p>

					<p>What is never discussed when it comes to Fox is how they deal in half-truths, mis-leading information, and outright lies. It is one thing to be biased but quite another to make stuff up to support your position</p>

					<p>Have you read the title? &#8220;5 FACTS&#8221; and not &#8220;5 OPINIONS about Fox News&#8221;.<br />
That means everything in this article is documented and researched.<br />

Therefore, if you want your OPINION to be taken into account here, just assess this RESEARCH-and-not-opinion article just as factually and scientifically as it is built.</p>

					<p>After the elections I stopped watching Fox News I used to switch from CNN MSNBC and FOX<br />
You talk about sore losers the only one who I like is Shep Smith the rest are all loudmouth bullies talking about liberalism like its cancer.<br />
I would hope in this day and age we would help each other not boast when they cut programs for the poor and elderly but I heard there owner was kicked of of his own country for distorting news I guess you can get away with anything in this country</p>

					<p>I will stop watching Fox News because of the absolutely obnoxious and ridiculously condescending, patronizing and deceitful liberal commentators. The likes of Bob Beckel, Richard Fowler, Simon Rosenberg, Julie Roginsky, Juan Williams, Kirsten powers..etc are enough to make anyone want to take a bath and wash clean after listening to their garble. I like facts and truth. However, when the likes of Mark Hanna gets on the television and tries to talk in a manner that insults the average man with an IQ above 100 is beyond frustrating. Between Fowler and Hannah the United States would implode within 7. 4 days. The Galactic stupidity of these individuals that are expressed daily and nightly R mirror eye openers for what is inside the mind of men that never pick up a rifle to defend their country; instead, they call the foolish psychopathic ignorant morons that do defend this country things like crazy, dangerous, ignorant, uneducated, stupid etcetera etcetera. No wonder military recruiters are finding their mission almost impossible to accomplish without compromising their dignity. For example, please look up the autistic child sent to marine boot camp. I just so happen to have had the honor, the privilege, in the respect of my fellow Americans to serve three tours as a drill instructor to ensure that America is getting exactly what it deserves when it counts on its United States Marines to fight bleed and die if necessary to protect them while they sleep warm in their beds at night. Like my forefathers that protected me, I felt a civic and moral responsibility to allow my government to place me in positions and situations they could have taken my life daily so long as it kept the wolf away from the door. I never once advertised what I did for a living I see no you send it. I simply went to work did my job and never expected anything for it such as reward fame or money. I just wanted to serve honorably and not let my family, neighbors, and fellow countrymen down. I sincerely wish Fox would reconsider just who they give a mic to. These liberals are beyond realistic common thinking, they will be the first ones to beg for help when the wolf growls&#8230;</p>

					<p>I am a conservative.. but Fox News has become nothing more than ridiculas news comedy, with quacks like Sean Hannity and the Judge lady(forgot her name) but the worst is Hannity and how he bows down to Netanyahu and Israeli concerns, which is ok, but he is so over the top with his crazy nonsense! but then we MSNBC  and also have guys like Al Sharpton as a news caster?? hell I can&#8217;t even understand the clown!</p>

					<p>Bottom line is all news stations lie &amp; are own by big corporations. Lies sells &amp; fox news went to court to see if they could lie. We don&#8217;t have real news any more they give their opinions &amp;make up stories that will sell.

					<p>In my opinion, Aljazeera has the least bias among top news organizations. Just one look at the headlines on their websites and you notice the difference in clarity from other news organizations like CNN who use luring tactics to draw you into their articles, and even the ol&#8217; bait-and-switch occasionally. Aljazeera reporting is typically very straightforward and that&#8217;s something I respect in journalism.</p>

					<p>I used to watch Fox News until I realized if you don,t agree with there point of view your wrong. It is disgusting how they love the Republican Party. Both party&#8217;s are the problem they are like 2 street gangs fighting for a piece of turf. That&#8217;s why nothing will ever get done in Washington. Fox News never talks about there beloved republicans getting special interest gifts/money to buy there influence it happens in both party&#8217;s. Abolish the 2 party system then this country stands a chance. I could go on about more but I won&#8217;t . We live in a free country watch what you will as for me not interested in there 100% biased story&#8217;s/news</p>

					<p>How about truth in broadcasting?  There used to be a law, but that was rescinded.<br />
Fox Noise is not a news channel, just an opinion hack station.  It is so negative, biased,<br />
and with statements like &#8220;some say&#8221; makes it a channel we just can&#8217;t stand to watch.<br />
You cannot trust their pundits.</p>

					<p>Judgmental and nonconstructive response. This article is about Fox, so the comment is about Fox. Who mentioned MSNBC but you? The fact of the matter is, no cable TV news broadcasting service is NEWS anymore. News is supposed to be an unbiased reporting of the facts &#8211; what&#8217;s KNOWN. No station does it well.</p>
<p>But, we continue to split hairs about who&#8217;s better or worse, and we absorb the nonsense we hear instead of just thinking for ourselves. Yes, keeping up with the news is important, but UNDERSTAND that the news you are watching does more than tell you current events, it&#8217;s trying to sell you a message.</p>

					<p>I agree Fox News is top dog.  But I am losing respect for this Corp.  There is no reason in the world as to why they and Dish Network cannot agree on a new contract.  It has been a month since Dish has blamed Fox and Fox blamed Dish.  It has been a month since loyal viewers who subscribe to Dish have been ignored.  There are thousands, probably, who have changed providers so they can get Fox News.  But, also, there are thousands, who like myself, can&#8217;t change providers unless we want to pay a penalty for dropping Dish.  So, when is this stalemate going to end?  Who is going to cave first?   When are the powers that be going to do the right thing and give the viewers of Fox News and customers of Dish Network back what we have been paying for and deserve.</p>

					<p>You have it totally backwards.  Many conservatives consider themselves centerists or liberal even though they would be considered right wing by most of the world.  The Democratic Party is not left wing, though it has a progressive wing.  For the most part, by comparison with the left in other industrial nations, it is center-right.  The true left depends much more on the internet for information, since they are not being served by MSM.  Both major parties are beholden to corporate and ultra-rich sponsorship, so the left is largely left with a choice between the lesser of two evils.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m not trying to be rude, but, it&#8217;s easy to google Fox&#8217;s problems with credibility.  And if you check, you will find sources you think are worthy of belief. </p>
<p>Back in 2010 (I think) I accidentally put on Faux News. The bubble head reported that President Obama&#8217;s trip to India would cost the tax payers $200 million a day. (I mean, seriously!) I choked bc  I laughed and my coffee went down the wrong pipe. You don&#8217;t have to fact check to know a report like that is made up. Preposterous. But right wing social media was apoplectic about it within minutes. Their fans believed it bc it confirmed their pre-existing bias about Obama. (How can a bunch of adults be that gullible???)</p>
<p>After watching another 20 minutes, I had to turn it off. There was far too much opinion being reported as fact. </p>
<p>I recall thinking that even 1st year college journalism students would know better. The sad part is &#8211; they seem not to CARE as long as they make the Democrats and Obama look like idiots and thieves. </p>
<p>Opinion belongs on talk shows,  NOT news! No wonder why the US keeps electing progressively crazier and more unqualified people to Congress. As long as they are &#8220;godly&#8221; and fundamentalist, they get elected.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m old enough to recall a more sane America that worried about JFK&#8217;s ability to think independent of the Pope. That was back when people smoked pot, drank a lot more, and did drugs.  &#8220;Sober&#8221; America is NOT an improvement. </p>
<p>America &#8211; what happened? If we don&#8217;t fix this, we are heading for disaster. The electoral process requires voters to be well informed and be capable of using critical thinking. </p>
<p>Thanks to Roger Ailes, we no longer do either.</p>

					<p>Another interesting tidbit from these numbers&#8230; CNN, NPR, MSNBC, and the NYT reader/viewerships are all significantly more skewed left than Fox News viewership tends right. But we are still told ad-infinitum that Fox panders to conservatives. Trust me, the MSM knows who butters their bread.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d like to see your source of info, especially on NPR. Either your ignorant of the facts or just trying to see if anyone will bite.  People who already have an opinion watch Fox to have someone to agree with, they aren&#8217;t really looking for an opposing view or information which may be contrary to the way they think, seriously when was the last time you felt really challenged to think about the view being presented on Fox? I&#8217;m gonna guess it&#8217;s somewhere around Never. Sure they bring on soft schill pundits all the time but these are people that hardly ever have the facts straight and easy targets for Fox pundits to beat up on, for and for that reason no other news networks use these so called alternative progressive or liberal-lite commentators (Alan Comes was a shining example).</p>

					<p>As Martin pointed out&#8230;. his source of information is &#8220;these numbers.&#8221; Meaning, they came from this article. </p>
<p>Self identified liberal make up 34.5% of the viewers of CNN, MSNBC, NPR, and NYT, while Fox views are 60% self identified conservatives. Martin essentially translates this as CNN, MSNBC, NPR, and NYT are skewed more liberal than Fox is skewed conservative. If this is what Martin did, that would be called really really really poor mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p>More likely, looking along party lines, Fox viewers are 40% Republican, and the other stations are 49% Democrat. I presume the reason for this apparent reversal is Fox has a high percentage of Tea Party viewers. So, I think Martin has made an innocent misinterpretation of the data.</p>

					<p>Yes, MSM knows who butters their bread.  Corporations and the ultra-rich.  Which is why there was not a single network that didn&#8217;t support going to war with iraq, and why Donahue was cancelled on MSNBC for questioning it, though he had their highest viewership.  The myth of the liberal media is exactly that, a myth.  And Faux News is just a propaganda channel, preying on the fears of the angry and gullible.  Faux&#8217;s most ardent fans are Tea Partiers, the far right of the Republican Party.  The reason that viewership is down on all news networks is that people are realizing that their views and concerns are not being addressed there, so they are turning to alternative sources or becoming disgusted and disillusioned.</p>

					<p>i hear that all the time from Fox fans. That&#8217;s NOT true. Yes, MSNBC&#8217;s opinion based programs tend to be liberal. The news is just news. I think you and lot of other Americans don&#8217;t know the difference. i was arguing with a Fox viewer who kept insisting that Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow were left leaning. Yes, they were. But they had talk shows &#8211; OPINION &#8211; not news. </p>
<p>If this guy was so uninformed that he didn&#8217;t know the difference, you can&#8217;t fault MSNBC bc the viewer doesn&#8217;t know that facts don&#8217;t have a left or right bias. They just ARE.</p>

					<p>As someone else here pointed out, most conservatives correctly identify themselves as such, whereas all but the most partisan leftists consider themselves centrist. This makes the viewership ideological breakdown here suspect.</p>
<p>Another interesting conclusion from these numbers is that while liberals refuse to watch Fox and so isolate themselves from contrary opinion, conservatives tend to get their news from a multitude of sources across the political spectrum. By that metric alone conservatives are better informed.</p>

					<p>MSNBC often has conservatives on. And they don&#8217;t treat them as badly as Fox treats liberals. But if you have never watched any you would be uninformed on that matter. Joe Scarborough ( morning joe) is quite conservative, just not far enough right for the tea party.</p>

					<p>So true about the soft schill pundits from the left on Fox. I cannot recall seeing any of them on any other &#8220;left&#8221; talk show or given any credence as legitimate by the left. I think SNL has already made a mockery of this.</p>

					<p>Just a quick question: How do all the local FOX News affiliates operate? Are they under strict control of FOX News Channel and allowed to report only approved stories or are they independently operated?</p>

					<p>Local news is driven by local events. The national news is piped in and recorded for broadcast, or broadcast as it comes in, depending on the timezone. The local news divisions generally do not have the budget for national stories. It is hard for the little CBS in Boise, Idaho to generate enough revenue to support an investigative reporter in D.C. therefore, they pull stories from the wires&#8211; AP, Reuters and of course, their own people. Keep in mind that usually a News Director wants to get promoted to a bigger market or a better salary and to do that, they need to increase ratings or have a prize-winning newsroom, or somehow get a resume superior to the competition for the slots.<br />
To win those prizes, stories often need to appeal to those who favor the Left point of view, or at the very least, not be against the Left point of view. The only reason that is generally (not always) true is because the vast majority (I can&#8217;t recall exactly, but it is a very high number) of journalists&#8211;including the decision makers admit to being Left of center. The great thing is that to increase ratings, the stories have to appeal to the demographics of the audience. Ratings drive the news divisions. Without good ratings, they cannot raise ad revenue. Ad revenue theoretically keeps the lights on for the rest of the station. In reality, your local news is more a reflection of what sells advertising than anything else.</p>

					<p>Is that so? Then why are they registered with the FCC as an &#8220;entertainment network?&#8221; also a full 65% of its programming is editorial in nature &#8230; that is not exactly objective information, in fact I&#8217;d say most people that watch Fox have already made their minds up and are just looking for someone to agree with them.</p>
<p>I try and watch it at least twice a week as well as CNN, I rarely watch MSNBC &#8211; I mostly get my news from the Google News page which has the most widely subscribed news algorithm of any net source so you get plenty of varying views.<br />
If you don&#8217;t think Fox&#8217;s reporting comes with a heavy Conservative lean than you are either dishonest with yourself, you believe their well funded PR machine or your just ill informed due to never straying from your one source.</p>

					<p>So imagine Obama signs a bill that allows for the government to put tiny cameras into anyone&#8217;s house, if there is suspicion of illegal activity, without the owner knowing. There are three ways of reporting this:</p>
<p>Station 1- The president has signed a new security bill that will allow for police to react faster to home break-ins and to bust drug dealers</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Station 2- This is the end of democracy and privacy. </p>
<p>This is how reporting goes. Different outlets will tell different stories in different tones. While BOTH reports are true, both stations reported a different true fact about the same situation. </p>
<p>The third way is kind of a blend: UNBIASED-</p>
<p>Station 3- The president has signed a new security bill that will allow for police to react faster to home break-ins and to bust drug dealers. However, this could mean the government would be able to see average civilian lives and intrude on privacy.</p>
<p>By presenting both sides of an argument, and showing the facts over opinions, the station successfully conveyed an entire story, rather than one party&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p>This is why I like BBC. If you agree or disagree with me, so be it. This is a country of free speech after all, and all news networks have the right to say anything they want (unless it  causes deformation of character or public chaos) .</p>

					<p>I can&#8217;t understand why people only bash Fox news. MSNBC is bias as well and could be described as the liberal extreme news network. Just because you are on one political spectrum does not mean that news networks that are on the opposite side are evil. Our media is bias and has different agendas, we should take each story with a grain of salt and do our own research to conclude the truth and not just blindly follow our own political bias that has formed as a result of our polarized political spectrum. Please be respectful and not slanderous, it just makes you look ignorant.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s because Fox has the slogan &#8220;fair and balanced.&#8221; They act like they aren&#8217;t skewed. MSNBC doesn&#8217;t do as much pretending. Not that I care. I don&#8217;t trust any of them.</p>

					<p>Msnbc does not identify as a news organization it is purely people and panels discussing the events that are occurring NOT reporting it! Also Msnbc does not hide their progressive liberal stances hints their slogan &#8220;Lean Forward&#8221;. Fox on the other hand claims to be a news organization reporting the news which they do not it is the same as Msnbc where people discuss the news not report it and they hide behind their &#8220;Fair and balanced&#8221; slogan where they are anything but! If they were truly fair and balanced they would report BOTH sides and not just the side bashing Obama! They would report the good things about the ACA and how it has helped millions and millions of people and not just the horror stories!</p>

					<p>It has helped millions? How exactly has it helped millions? The biggest complaint was that healthcare bankrupted people, because access was never an issue. Well now you have the taxpayers paying your premium, but who is going to pay that $6,000+ deductible and the co-pay percentage? If you can&#8217;t afford the premiums, you surely will not be able to afford to use the new insurance that the taxpayers just bought you. But most doctors don&#8217;t accept your insurance anyway. The help you are claiming is on paper only. In practice, it is going to be a nightmare. This is all while the insurance companies laugh all the way to the bank with the taxpayers&#8217; money. But we can ignore all of that if you think the price tag is worth the only good part, that insurance companies can not deny you for pre-existing conditions?</p>

					<p>Just how many people do you know on Obama Care. I know quite a few.  Obviously you have never researched it.  My son is on it.  His job offered insurance at $1200 a month when he only made about 1800 a month. he makes more now.  On Obama care he got a co pay policy with NO DEDUCTABLE at all.  This is for him AND his daughter.  Everything has a co pay.  There were plenty of plans to choose from with just about any deductible you want depending on what you can afford a month.  His monthly payment is about 350 a month and that includes dental. The subsidy he gets from the government is on $45.  With his next raise he will not get any subsidy and his payment will go up to about 400.  MANY MANY doctors take it. On his plan he has about 10 to pick from as his primary. The two best hospitals my our area take it.  I also have two sisters that got insurance through it.  One gets no subsidy at all.  One daughter in law&#8217;s life was saved when she was able to get on her parents policy and a cancerous condition was caught and taken care of. I am not on Obama care have great insurance and can go anywhere I want.  I recently went to one doctor that had a sign on his office that said he did not accept any insurance that was purchased through obamacare.  I walked out.  I am 62 and have several doctors that I see.  Since Obama care is private insurance and pays the same way as any other insurance doctors that do not take it are just being #### and I would not want to go to them even though I am not on obamacare.  I have had BCBS for over 30 years.  My sister has BCBS through obamacare.  We have the same doctors.  I am so tired of the lies,</p>

					<p>Providing that you can even get insured by the oh-so noble affordable healthcare act. My mother is absolutely broke. I don&#8217;t think she has a dime to her name and yet is not qualified for ObamaCare (she is uneployed). At the time she applied she had a shoddy waitress job while paying debts from a recent divorce. Why is that? Now she has to pay this fine for NOT having Obamacare. And this was all to make the premiums go down.</p>

					<p>That&#8217;s actually correct. I recall when Fox went on the air it was selling itself as &#8220;news from a conservative perspective.&#8221; That. by definition, is NOT news, it&#8217;s opinion. News isn&#8217;t left or right, it just is. </p>
<p>Sorry folks Today&#8217;s Republicans are such knuckleheads that when a story is reported factually it too often catches a Republicans with his hand in the cookie jar. Whether it&#8217;s about right wing hypocrites, telling an untruth, or just being extremist. (Like the &#8220;expert&#8221; who claiming a fetus felt pain bc it was masturbating). </p>
<p>There are just far too many preposterous Right WIng charlatans claiming to be experts.  When are called on their preposterous claims, they fight back by playing the victim instead of just owning their dishonesty. Sad.</p>

					<p>Actually, that story was repeatedly debunked by Snopes.  It was a local Fox affiliate station, not Fox News, and it was a story that the two anchors didn&#8217;t want to cover.  That story had nothing to do with Fox News.</p>

					<p>Actually, it was not debunked. Fox&#8217;s argument was that FCC policy against intentionally presenting falsified news was just that, policy and not law. Therefore when Fox intentionally presents information that is untrue and biased it does not actually VIOLATE any laws. The Court in fact found that Fox had presented information that was untrue, and it agreed with Fox that it had not broken any laws since it was just a policy.</p>

					<p>Actually it&#8217;s called agitprop or propaganda. It&#8217;s scandalous that our regulatory system is so ineffective that one out of two of our major political parties gets away with owning a media outlet which functions 24/7/365 to spit out right wing propaganda. It&#8217;s sole mission is to elect Republicans while discrediting their opponents. Most of their funds coming from sources like Koch Enterprises. Bye bye democracy.</p>

					<p>They get bashed because they have been shown over an over again to lie, mislead, and incite racial hatred. Telling people to call or e-mail, after they announce the appropriate contact number or address, in order to harass, even send death threats to everyone from school principals to doctors (remember Dr, Tiller and BO&#8217;R&#8217;s demonization of him until some RWNJ killed him) that Fox deems enemies of America for not following the far right vision of a corporate dependent, far right xtian, militaristic and apartheid loving populace.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s amazing that anyone takes any news outlet too seriously. They are ALL agenda driven and biased towards some political side. The fact that most are too ignorant to make a decision on their own is truly a travesty. America is quickly becoming the land of mindless drones and narcissists. Truth is, to become truly informed, one must take all news organizations with a grain of salt, and then make their own decision. Common sense is a must to be truly enlightened. We live in a world where greed rules, and decency towards one-another is near extinction. In order to survive as a country, a species, is to love one-another and  stop using a political side to make a rational decision. Off my soapbox now&#8230;..</p>

					<p>Scott please stop the false equivalence. There is nothing perfect in this world, but comparing the purposeful lies of Fox to credible news organizations like Al Jazeera or BBC is just ludicrous. I am in total agreement that people need to learn to filter and make informed decisions, but painting all news organizations with the same brush is patently false. Try NPR</p>

					<p>Al Jazeera&#8230; really?</p>
<p>The BBC is widely recognized (not just by conservatives) as tilted quite hard to the left. I watch a wide range of news sources, including Fox and the Beeb (and CNN, etc.)&#8230; BBC is definitely more ideological in its straight news reporting than Fox. Most media bias is revealed not in outright lies but by selective reporting. The MSM is the champion at not reporting things that don&#8217;t fit their worldview.</p>
<p>Wait! I can hear the lefties now&#8230; &#8220;you actually claim that Bill O or Hannity are unbiased?&#8221; No, both are clearly identified as &#8220;opinion&#8221;, not hard news. Claiming that Fox NEWS is not fair because their opinion entertainers are biased right is no more valid than insisting that MSNBC news reporting should be judged by the standard of Keith Olberman.</p>

					<p>I agree. I think it may be a good thing for voters to take a test on the issues as their vote effects all of us. Be informed on all politicans &amp; how the vote on issues that will effect our country/state/county/city or town before you mark/punch/click/score the voting card.</p>

					<p>CNN and MSNBC like the rest of the media go easy on Obama. Fox news is the only station providing any kind of balance. Liberals in general had put so much belief and pride behind Obama and they can not face up to his failures to lead this nation. He does not have a plan only operating by public opinion polls that he calls &#8220;leading from behind&#8221;. Cry all you want Democrats. You know Obama over promised and delivered on nothing and your just mad because Fox news has the guts to point out details MSNBC and CNN conveniently omit. NO YOU WILL NOT SILENCE THE RIGHT!</p>

					<p>You have some valid points, but don&#8217;t call Fox news coverage &#8220;guts&#8221;. When President Bush was sending us down the path of destruction in his policies, Fox News used their &#8220;guts&#8221; to back away and give him a straight up 100% pass.</p>

					<p>Its weird that you think they have the &#8220;guts&#8221; to call out the president. When Bush was president, FOX was telling their audience that it was un-American to criticize the president. Funny how that works.</p>

					<p>Fox News provides balance to the electorate the same way that alcohol provides balance to the inebriated. It only seemed like you were the life of the party at the time. In hindsight it&#8217;s hard to reconstruct exactly what happened except that a number of people who witnessed these events are more careful about talking to you.</p>

					<p>I know &#8220;facts&#8221; don&#8217;t lie.  But does anybody truly believe that 32 percent of MSNBC viewers are conservative?</p>

					<p>I want the news.  I want to know what is going on locally and around the world.<br />
But I don&#8217;t want to listen to Fox bias, criticism and propaganda.  Trying to convince me how to think, what to think or who to hate.  Any attempt at watching Fox news and ignoring the negative comments doesn&#8217;t work, it makes me feel ill and I have to shut it off.  News should not be a platform for opinions and politicking.   Fox takes free speech to a level that borders on harm to society through misinformation.  News, research and reporting.  Let people come to their conclusions.  I&#8217;m tired of your blatant agenda.</p>

					<p>Have you ever even tried watching Fox News for more re than 20 seconds? The way you talk about sounds like you&#8217;ve never even watched it. Your opinion on the the matter is very skewed, Fox News is one of the few national news stations that gives both sides. The anchors on at the time may weigh in and tell what they believe in (which is one of their rights) but by no means are they &#8220;Trying to you convince you how to think,  what to think and who to hate&#8221;. Fox News gives you a lot of freedom to make your own decisions based on the FACTS. </p>

					<p>I have watched Fox and find no balance whatsoever.  Their coverage of &#8220;the other side&#8221; is smoke and mirrors.  Token liberals whom I don&#8217;t recognize and have not seen on stations leaning liberal.  It&#8217;s a sham.  Fox seems to have no respect for its viewers or they would not blatantly lie to them or distort the real news.  Benghazi indeed, weeks and weeks of coverage at the expense of more current and more profound news after a while.  There is no perspective in their programming, only whatever will promote more hatred and/or fear.  A wonderful Republican propaganda machine.</p>

					<p>Karin stop lying, you don&#8217;t watch fox. If you did you would know that they report what the liberal sites don&#8217;t report. Their motto, we report you decide leaves it up to the viewer to decide what they want to believe.  No one forces anyone to believe anything. You make that choice. But at least on fox they give you that choice. I would bet money most of the people that say they watch fox and dont like it never watch fox. If they did they would be much more informed. Why would anyone watch something they hate.That isn&#8217;t even logical.</p>

					<p>Why is it that almost every time a liberal guest starts making sense (i.e. stating true facts that always prove fox wrong) on fox, they are cut off, or their time has run out? That doesn&#8217;t happen on MSNBC, or CNN, but is common on fox.</p>

					<p>Well, another Pew Research poll found that FOX news viewers are the most uninformed among all the news groups. That also included people who don&#8217;t watch the news at all. Political Science. That&#8217;s an oxymoron when it comes to FOX.</p>

					<p>It is fairly obvious that like many Fox news detractors you do not confine yourself to the &#8220;news&#8221; on Fox.  The network has more than news, it has &#8220;commentary&#8221;.  Sadly many with the extreme left wing agenda cannot tell the difference.  </p>
<p>I cannot count the number of people I have encountered who use the argument that &#8220;Fox tells nothing but lies&#8221;.   They then go on to cite a segment of Hannity or O&#8217;Reilly with which they disagree as proof.  Yet they fail to comprehend that both of these shows are &#8220;Commentary&#8221; not news.  They further fail to comprehend that &#8220;Opinions&#8221; are not &#8220;facts&#8221; they are persona views about the facts.  Sadly many liberals admit by their criticism that they don&#8217;t know the difference.  The Commentators like Hannity, O&#8221;Reilly, Van Susteren, etc. bring up news stories that were written by others and discuss them.  They do not directly report on breaking news.  Try watching &#8220;Happening Now&#8221; , &#8220;America News Room&#8221; or &#8220;Shepard Smith Reporting&#8221;  these are a few of the show on Fox that report &#8220;news&#8221;, if you want opinions on the news go to Hannity or O&#8217;Reilly.</p>
<p>As for Fox being biased in their &#8220;NEWS&#8221; try watching the actual &#8220;News&#8221; (Not commentary) on Fox then compare them to the other network &#8220;News&#8221; not &#8220;commentary&#8221; shows, and you will find that they are pretty much all the same, reporting the same information.   </p>
<p>So if Fox is lying to you, so is everyone else.</p>

					<p>the issue isn&#8217;t that Fox has no news, but that the commentary elements of fox (which takes the majority of its primetime programming and has by far the highest viewership numbers) are projected as &#8220;news.&#8221;</p>

					<p>I taught students how to recognize bias, propaganda and brainwashing when reading, listening, or watching tV.  While most media are somewhat bias because they choose what they provide as news, Fox News is nothing but bias and uses only propaganda and brainwashing on every program they put on the air.  They hate Democrats and President Obama, and they are very prejudiced against minorities.  They spin(yes, O&#8217;Reily spins everything on his show, and by his claiming to be a no spin zone, he is using a very common propaganda technique,) and they twist the truth, and yes, they even lie very often.  They claim to be &#8220;Fair and Balanced,&#8221; which is another very common and effective propaganda technique.  By repeatedly saying this, they convince the audience that this is true, where in fact, they are the most unfair and unbalanced tv network on the air.   They teach hate and intolerance, and shows like Hannity and O&#8217;Reily, The Five and  for awhile Glen Beck, and all the others use brainwashing techniques daily.<br />
     I was a proud Republican all my life, conservative on many issues, but liberal on some others, so I considered myself an independent and voted for people from both parties.  Then I began watching Rush Limbaugh on TV in the 80&#8217;s, and was disgusted by his hated and vehemence.  Then in the 90&#8217;s, Fox News made me so ashamed to be a Republican.  I consider myself an Independent now, but in 2007 I became a Democrat.  I can no longer be a part of that hatred and intolerance.  No one could love their country more than I do, but we need to understand that in a Democracy there is more than one side to an issue, and we need to respect that.  We need to vote for those we agree with, and to abide by the plans of those voted into power. We don&#8217;t take oaths to block everything they want to do while in office. If we don&#8217;t like what they do,  then we vote to remove them from office and put someone else in.  We don&#8217;t need TV and radio people to teach us to hate the other party, and to be intolerant of everything they do.</p>

					<p>Welcome to the Democrat club.<br />
Huge debt, more poverty, less income and less freedom.<br />
Look at the Democrat states like California and compare them to Republican states like Texas. Everyone is flocking to the Republican states.<br />
Food for thought.</p>

					<p>Uh. The country has been under Republican economic policy for over 30 years. You cant blame the Democrats for that one. How did we go from surplus to debt from Clinton (Democrat) to Bush (Republican). People seem to forget that Welfare doubled under Bush also. 20 million to 40 million people. Cant just blame the democrats. They are just as bad tho. Both sides support a Corporatist agenda and corporations don&#8217;t care about the people of this country. When Bush listened to corporations saying that they didn&#8217;t want to bring their money back to the states because it was being taxed to high, he put a 5% tax in place for 2 years. They brought their money in promising more jobs and growth. All they did was lay off more people and keep their money. Look it up if you want.</p>

					<p>Clinton did not control the Congress that pass bills related to the economy that was republican run with Newt at the speaker position.  Also Clinton was in at the right time.  The dot Com boom came with him in the office trending the economy upwards, also when the bubble burst on the dot Com boom, Bush was in.  Both parties are bad, bias is not productive.  Until we put aside party lines and do what is best no matter which side  omes up with it, nothing g will change</p>

					<p>It is really scary how left-wingers like you want to shut everyone up with whom they disagree.  You make the libelous statements that Fox News people hate minorities yet you cannot cite a single example.  Furthermore, it really scares me that you are a teacher and don&#8217;t know the difference between news and commentary.  Hannity and O&#8217;Reilly are NOT NEWS SHOWS!  They are political commentary shows just like Chris Matthews, Rachel Maddow, and Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell are on MSNBC who all tilt left.</p>

					<p>Anti- constitution, give me a break. I find it really funny how republicans are big supporters of the constitution until it defends a point of view that they don&#8217;t agree with, then they want to change it.</p>

					<p>Since the discussion here is turning that way let me make sure my copy of The Constitution (God Bless America! God Bless America! God Bless America!) still has its trusty place in my suit pocket. Ah, good, right by the spare razor I use to keep my 9 AM shadow at bay! You don&#8217;t really love the document, after all, unless you quote a passage from it at least three times a day and use it to condemn the internet liberal-heathens for their diabolical anti- Constitution conspiracy. It&#8217;s almost like putting a cross in front of a vampire! Liberals cower in the guilt of how they knowingly, by the tens of millions, are attempting to subvert the one true country by confounding the &#8220;scripture&#8221; that set it free. &#8220;We The People&#8221; know best how to interpret this founding document of truth. All twelve of us, in fact, meet every Saturday to teach the good word printed on every scrap of US hard currency: &#8220;In God We Trust.&#8221; We love reflections because, just for a moment&#8217;s glance, our bright and immaculately hairless, cherubic faces remind us of His love.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230; For a moment there it was like I was channeling the ghost of the John Birch Society. Ideological purity and certitude, all in nationalistic and patriotic tones&#8230; What&#8217;s hard for me to understand is trying to mix these components in the name of a constitution like ours. Did the American experiment wither on the vine and fossilize more than 200 years ago or are we still trying to develop the thing to this day? Why even have a government if the work has all been done? Couldn&#8217;t it have been built to run a lot &#8220;slower&#8221; with more overt references to budget procedures to begin with if The Founders were really mostly concerned about how this part of the interpretation would go?</p>
<p>&#8220;We the people&#8221; are listed from start of the constitution. I&#8217;d say where America&#8217;s really gone wrong is when some of those &#8220;people&#8221; haven&#8217;t counted for as much as they should for this &#8220;we.&#8221; I guess they were the villains or public concerns du jour. Perceived as a sufficient threat such can be marginalized, unprotected in rights by the founding document wronged from the first line.</p>

					<p>When I was a young student I was taught to NEVER use words that would imply bias. It was my job as a reporter to report the news, in its entirety honestly.  Now Fox News Shows openly offer opinions while only reporting 1/2 truths, exaggerations and their idea of &#8216;whats right and wrong&#8217;. I see a little less of it on CNN and others, but I don&#8217;t really watch any of those anymore, I&#8217;ve been watching Al Jazeera America, it seems the most fair.</p>

					<p>I have e mailed FOX news about 9 times over the past 6 months and have never gotten a reply back from any news correspondent I&#8217;ve e mailed???? So, we don&#8217;t watch FOX network anymore, CNN and MSNBC will give us plenty of good and bad news when we want it. This guy, Al Sharpton of CNN is one arrogant person and in my opinion dysfunctional, and talks too much and many times he seems to always support the NAACP and seems to talk down the police departments in our nation that try to protect us, yet when one person is shot and killed, (maybe Mr. Sharpton should walk a street beat in Detroit or Philadelphia at night for 6 months like some of our finest have been doing, he wouldn&#8217;t last one night on the job. Bill O&#8217;Reilly is a great guy, very intelligent, but like all of us, he has his problems and has never answered any of my e mails to him. By the way, Greta Van S. is a member of the Scientology cult (It&#8217;s not a religion) and I&#8217;m surprised at her for being a Scientology member, that&#8217;s really scary. Ask Tom Cruises ex wife about the Scientology cult and their practices after her divorce to Mr. Cruise who might be a good actor for Hollywood, but research what Scientology teachs, they&#8217;d be better off in the middle east and not the middle eastern united states. So that&#8217;s all, God Bless the USA and hopefully we won&#8217;t be fighting Islamic extremists on our soil one day, but if the current administration including congress takes the currently beheading of a US citizen lightly and doesn&#8217;t come down super, super hard on the people responsible for the horrific crime, they should all be fired. Jesse Ventura is the guy who knows where things are headed and I understand the former Governor has moved out of the United States, I wonder why??  Have a wonderful day, David J.

					<p>I have written, phoned, faxed and e-mailed the White House at least once a month since Obama took office, and in all that time I have NEVER received an answer to ANY of my questions.  In fact, in all that time, I have received one communication from them, on Mothers Day 2012, congratulating me for doing a good job as a Mother.  As a 57 year old man with kids my kids 15 years out of the house, I must question the sincerity and intelligence of this President and/or his staff.  By your standard, I guess I no longer need pay any attention to him or his inane policies.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m curious to find out if others are getting tired of Fox.  I am over 55, conservative, and live in OK, and used to like Fox news shows, but I am sick of how everything that they say is in a demeaning, degrading manner towards anybody except conservatives.  Plus they always try and get in some kind of slam, punch or snide remark in one way or the other. You can get used to it and not notice so much for a while, but if you step out of the conservative box for a minute, you can see exactly what is going on, and it&#8217;s sickening.  Why can&#8217;t they report and not do that?  I didn&#8217;t vote for Obama, but I&#8217;m tired of hearing them slam and cut anything and everything he does.  He is our president, so why can&#8217;t they try and support America?  It&#8217;s not just Obama, it&#8217;s any subject that they don&#8217;t agree with, such as medical cannabis, which was a medicine until 1937 when it was demonized, and Fox is still making it out as evil, even though it&#8217;s saving the lives of people with seizures. Yet Fox calls them potheads, which really is being evil.  Fox doesn&#8217;t seem to be fair and balanced at all, and I&#8217;d guess that they are losing viewers because of their constant attempt to influence people with their demeaning snide remarks to democrats and whoever doesn&#8217;t see things their way.</p>

					<p>Really Chuck, guess you missed the hatchet job MS-NBC and CNN did on Romney during the last election. If you are looking for &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; Fox is the only game in town. And sucking up to a very bad President isn&#8217;t supporting America. To the contrary, not calling a duck a duck isn&#8217;t fair to the pond.</p>

					<p>Chuck, I am glad that you have pointed out these things. It is important to get out of our boxes for a bit and see that some things aren&#8217;t so cut and dry. Some people do need welfare, some are trying to suck whatever they can from the freebie box. Some people can be productive members of society and still smoke pot, yet others have destructive personalities and marijuana makes them fall deeper into their hole of apathy. For the same reasons you&#8217;re unhappy with Fox News, I also don&#8217;t watch MSNBC anymore. I am more progressive (not quite far left) but I had to step out of the MSNBC bubble for a bit and realize that just like Fox News tends to stir people up on their issues, MSNBC does the same on the other side.</p>

					<p>I lean toward Fox, but I am getting tired of increasing commercial time. I have to watch an hour of Fox to get 30 minutes of news now days. MSNBC is so partisan I have a hard time watching it, although I have found some solace with Morning Joe. Really, all the so called news outlets have an agenda, what happened to just getting the news?</p>

					<p>If you just want the news no opinions no bias you need to be looking at places like the BBC, Al Jazeera America, Al Jazeera English, Sky News, the CBC, The Independent, The Guardian, the AP, Buzzfeed.

					<p>Though I wouldn&#8217;t call it straight news, it is statistically more factual than Fox.  Last time I checked, Fox new was rated at being truthful less than 20% of the time.</p>

					<p>Foxnews by far is the best , its not even close. All other news is nothing but progressive trash. Drudgereport is another source, which is my favorite. Progressive news is like Obama , they are both like the JV team.</p>

					<p>To Chuck,<br />
I am an independent, but I watch Fox News to get the truth. They tackle event that other stations do not dare touch. As for O&#8217;rielly, I often think he is a liberal posing aas a conservative. I do not always agree with any news network, but Fox appears to do the best job.<br />
a lot of people plck on Fox because they are conservative, but take a look at what MSNBC ddoes, and no one seems to complain.<br />
Personally, I think the news media should just report the facts and keep their &#8220;slant&#8221;out of the news. This government was not set up for the media to be the strongest arm in government, but it is. And it will take people like you andd me to turn the channels or better yet, cut the damn TV off and get a good book. Then maybe CNN HLN NBC, MSNBC ABand CBS, will stop fighting the one station, Fox, and news can get back to being civilized. But don&#8217;t hold your breath. Way to much outside and inside money is at stake. Good luck to you and your family. God bless.</p>

					<p>O&#8217;Rielly is anti-gun so that tells me he is not a true Conservative.  Someone once told me if a person does not trust you with a gun, you should not trust that person.  Good advice!</p>

					<p>I have watched Fox and it makes me very angry so I quit watching. It is very biased and bigoted with much hatred for our current President. I prefer MSNBC even though it is biased my way. I am liberal although most people tell me I am not liberal, I am moderate. I think liberal is best with such a diversifed people as Americans are!</p>

					<p>This just seems to be a fairly easy distinction to draw.  Despite the political failings of any news organization, it&#8217;s the MSNBC&#8217;s, and CNN&#8217;s of the world that will go down with a President who lies through his teeth.  Just shows the extent they will go to.  No moral issues there&#8230;</p>

					<p>I read most of these comments and have to say that if you read them all it definitely points to the divisiveness that culminates in ideological stubbornness on both sides. Including myself in that. But on the Fox issue. Although I rarely watch MSNBC I compliment them for being (with no misrepresentation or for that matter no excuses) a far left windbag machine. And this is where I part ways with those that watch FOX, subscribe to TPNN, The patriot (Ha!)&#8230;.. FOX specifically states that it is delivering fare and unbiased &#8220;news&#8221;. And worst of all its followers say this is true. I doubt that many regular watchers of MSNBC would say that they are fare and unbiased. FOX would have my respect if they took the same course as MSNBC and just said &#8220;We are here to be a conservative windbag machine&#8221;. So to Fox,  its followers. Man up. Quit lying to the public and yourselves. Trust me. You will get a lot more respect from independents like myself by taking this route verses the current direction</p>

					<p>MSNBC a left wing machine?  Nope.  They are pro establishment Democrat.  They are not left wing.  True left wingers do not like MSNBC and get uses sources such as The Young Turks, The David Pakman Show for their news.  The Young Turks has a larger audience than CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, HLN combined.</p>

					<p>There is no qualitative comparison between FOX with CNN and MSNBC cable news, the latter two which provide broad coverage of news and events with commentary, but targeted for a more informed audience. I would not call Fox talking points coverage. Ailes, himself calls it opinion and entertainment to avoid first amendment issues with fraud and slander. Fox conclusory talking points, as with those in the right wing echo chamber, are so entirely specious, one is amazed at the degree that two decades of social conditioning has so changed political discourse.  As Rove&#8217;s playbook attests, it&#8217;s fairly easy to manipulate right wing authoritarian submissives. When you can isolate the conservative voting block and foment an angry misinformed mob with well understood and extensively documented propaganda techniques in the FOX world, the dog that FOX wags is obvious.</p>

					<p>I think one of the appeals of Fox (or any &#8220;news&#8221; network that is mostly propaganda and, if MSNBC does the same thing in favor of the liberal point of view- I haven&#8217;t watched them enough to know- then this is true of them too) is that, because it is totally biased, it draws an audience that shares it&#8217;s point of view.  They can almost always count on it to share opinions that are like their own.  Because that audience shares it&#8217;s point of view, that audience sees Fox as &#8220;just telling the truth&#8221;.  As far as they are concerned, it is the truth.  On any network that just reported the news as objectively as possible or gave both sides, the audience would just tune out all arguments for the viewpoint they disagreed with.  But with Fox (and maybe MSNBC) they don&#8217;t have to even bother with having to hear an opposing viewpoint except maybe a couple of sentences before such a person gets cut off and the host (who always represents one ideology, conservative in Fox&#8217;s case), explains why they are wrong while allowing guests with views agreeing with theirs time to fully give their arguments.  But to an audience member who always sides with that network&#8217;s ideology, it isn&#8217;t biased but &#8220;just telling it like it is&#8221;.  </p>
<p>One could say that the days of Walter Cronkite and long over and that all news reporting is biased though I don&#8217;t know if it is really all.  However, from what I&#8217;ve seen, Fox takes that bias to the level of absurdity.</p>

					<p>I found this interesting.  I understand that it makes sense to start a study like this with a small focus, i.e. how the three major cable news channels compare and contrast.  Following the same tack, I&#8217;d love to see the study expanded to the other major sources of news that aren&#8217;t explicitly partisan: network news, news magazines, news blogs, news feeds like AP and Reuters, etc.  Viewership/readership numbers would also provide a sense of perspective.  I think it a lot of interesting things would emerge.  Even though it would be a much bigger study, it would reflect the fact that &#8220;news&#8221; comes from a variety of sources nowadays and is also filtered through a variety of lenses.</p>

					<p>Did not have to go far on this &#8216;fact-tank&#8217; article before I thought..Whao!!!!<br />
MSNBC does not even consider itself a &#8216;news channel&#8217;, so right from that point on your points stray away from what could be an insightful topic of discussion.<br />
Just the idea that one News organization could claim such an &#8216;ideological&#8217; swing to the  Conservative and beyond makes one wonder just what channel is truly the MSM.<br />
CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, etal; certainly are not.<br />
I tend to go for Reuters, and AP; don&#8217;t know where that puts me.<br />
All I know is that Fox News is just a television show that puts on a display for its targeted audiences.<br />
Frightful eh?</p>

					<p>This is a little deceptive while be truthful at the same time but the big picture is EARTH not one nation and when we look at International viewers not one station has ever beat CNN in viewers and it never will but FOX wants YOU to believe otherwise because of various ratings given like in this article. FOX has a lot more US viewers than CNN who turn a show on and sit through the entire thing so FOX beats CNN domestically easily that way no matter if numbers down or not. FOX does NOT beat CNN on how many people domestically turn one or the other on during a given moment since CNN always wins there and those are the mainstream aka majority and of course majority means Democracy so I will not demonize the word mainstream in attempt to fool ignorant people as some do. Most Americans who turn either Station on tend to work outside or inside the home but most want family time and are busy doing other things than just kicking back watching anything on TV let alone idiotic news. After all; when was it important for you personally that you saw CNN or FOX for news? LIKELY NEVER. Even in 911 unless you were right in the middle of it, you should have been watching HBO instead since hearing about it did you nothing other than cause some Americans to believe the US had been attacked by another nation on its homeland post the war of 1812 with England lol really. We have NEVER been attacked by a nation on our homeland since then but who should I educate fools?</p>
<p>CNN has another kind of viewership and it starts with U but I&#8217;m not saying what it is but it is something FOX can never catch up with and it&#8217;s domestic.</p>
<p>CNN has over one billion viewers worldwide while FOX has about 20 MILLION viewers worldwide so one could see, FOX is pathetic yet I consider all Cable or Network New pathetic since who in his or her right mind wants to work all day, come home, forget about family time and sit in front of a TV to listen to political or other BS and then just get angry over some lie or something YOU cannot ever control? An idiot and a real nut would have their poor kids sitting in front of the TV watching one of these so called news stations. I am neither idiot nor real nut. I am into logic, statistics and human sociology and a few other things but not the news. I make more in a month than most will pay in taxes in a lifetime and I don&#8217;t do it watching these stations. </p>
<p>I suggest people turn these stations off and especially the fanatical right wing and get to work and tending to family because this is one sick and angry nation as a result of two things; Regions and News. There is no God, not after life and it really is not the business of others what someone else is doing so get your nose out of gossip and educate your kids so the States can have HS grads coming out on 12th grade levels instead of the Second grade READER! We still have Americans who think homosexuality is a choice or a sin because of Religion and being idiotic and not using a dictionary with a so called Holy book or one would know words like abomination are from one thousand-five hundred years AFTER books of the Bible/Torah were written. lol</p>
<p>Time to wake up and grow up America.</p>

					<p>Dude&#8230; You are really making me laugh&#8230; Fox isn&#8217;t news at all&#8230; It is Conservative propaganda&#8230; there is no fairness to it at all&#8230; and most of what they say is made up&#8230;</p>

					<p>Dude&#8230;&#8230;Fox News and not their programs is the most fair reporting.  I watch the news on several channels.  When you make comments like this, it really shows that you don&#8217;t know what in the hell you are talking about.  I have actually taken top news stories, got as much info as possible, and then compare the reporting on all the major networks, Fox, and PBS (Sorry, I forgot to do CNN).  It was fun to see how they reported the story.  The major networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) shortened the story and left out a lot of information.  Fox did cover it pretty well.  PBS was the most interesting.  Martha Raddatz from ABC actually reported it well, but she left out something that was important to the story which showed a left bias by doing so.  Even if you don&#8217;t show your bias initially by what you say, it is important that you don&#8217;t omit important information.  Also, my friend, a liberal who watches PBS agreed that the material should have been presented because it didn&#8217;t give a full picture of the event.  Many times people who don&#8217;t like Fox News haven&#8217;t watched the news, but rather have watched a show like Hannity and think that&#8217;s their news.</p>

					<p>Not the Fox News I&#8217;ve watched.They are the propaganda wing of the Republican party.They constantly knock Obama when Bush did the same thing only worse.Case in point the release of prisoners from Gitmo.Don&#8217;t take my word just fact check it.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d say &#8220;luck&#8221; is generally positive, unless otherwise stated. You can &#8220;luck into&#8221; something but rarely &#8220;luck out&#8221; of it. &#8220;Luck out&#8221; seems to me to be similar to &#8220;win out&#8221; it&#8217;s applied to a <strong><a href="http://www.s78bet.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.s78bet.com/', 'Bandar Judi Bola');" rel="nofollow">Bandar Judi Bola</a></strong> favorable outcome of some situation, often ongoing, that might well have gone the other way. I do wonder if non-Americans may sometimes confuse &#8220;luck out&#8221; (positive) with &#8220;struck out&#8221; (negative). </p>

					<p>hm, something that jumps out at me is the race and gender numbers among Fox viewers.  also, seems funny doesn&#8217;t it, that after the first year of Obama&#8217;s first term, the Fox viewership has not increased like the years leading up to (along with the paranoia, among certain segments of the population) the election.  </p>
<p>i&#8217;d say this data is lacking in depth.</p>

					<p>Number 2 makes sense.  Various surveys have shown that liberals are least likely to seek out an opposing point of view.  It goes back to socialist Pauline Kael stating she did not understand how Nixon beat McGovern (it was a landslide) because she didn&#8217;t know anyone that voted for him.  Liberals tend to only listen to liberal media outlets because they don&#8217;t want to hear a dissenting point of view.  They relish confirmation of their &#8220;knowledge.&#8221; </p>
<p>In more current times, it would follow with the vilification of the Koch brothers.  Because of their support for conservative candidates, they are &#8220;evil.&#8221;  Most liberals would not bother to search out that the Kochs sponsor numerous programs on PBS and NPR or that David is a supporter of the immigration reform and supports gay marriage, notably more liberal positions.  But you won&#8217;t hear that on NPR, PBS, MSNBC, HLN, CNN, CBS, NBC, or ABC.  It doesn&#8217;t fit the narrative.</p>

					<p>We liberals have no need to hear opposing viewpoints, as our liberal media already provides opposing viewpoints already, since liberal media is fair and balanced.</p>
<p>IT is the conservatives that do not wish to hear opposing viewpoints, which is why they keep SAYING they are fair and balanced, to reinforce that false identity.  </p>
<p>If they were actually fair and balanced, they wouldn&#8217;t need to state that, correct?</p>

					<p>No, they state it as an assurance for anyone that calls them out. And furthermore, you say Liberals have no need to hear opposing viewpoints, but then say the liberal media provides opposing viewpoints already. Just that statement alone contradicts itself. I&#8217;ve watched MSNBC and CNN and MSNBC is the worst when it comes to bringing both sides in a debate. CNN has them, but CNN skews their stories to only the ones they decide to report. Every news station will have an idealogical bias.. you just have to look passed that and pay attention to the facts they report, which is why I still watch Fox news even after being skeptical for years. I&#8217;ve done my research and it&#8217;s safe to say, Fox brings on the most diverse panel for open debate on TV. They&#8217;re also growing in viewers, so I have no idea where these guys are getting their facts. If Fox news reported a false story, EVERYBODY would rip them apart. Instead, they rip apart the show host for his biased comment, cherry picking the opinion and not the fact. I don&#8217;t agree with some of O&#8217;Reilly and Hannity&#8217;s points such as pro life and criminalizing drugs, but they give you the whole story to decide for yourself.</p>

					<p>Well said. I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;re a libertarian.  Generally, I have a low opinion of you people. 😉<br />
People are forever confusing the reporting of news with the opinion shows like Hannity and O&#8217;Reilly. Obviously, they&#8217;re completely different.  Reporting good/bad things about candidates is not comparing apples to apples. Franky, there was nothing to report about Obama during that time. The fact that few positive statements were made about the president during that time is not an indication of any bias. We (the FNC audience) were aware of Fast and Furious, Benghazi, Obamacare nightmares and a myriad of other Obama scandals. Should they have made up positive crap to report?</p>

					<p>I don&#8217;t think either one of you ever watch Fox News. Watch Brett Baier not Sean Hannity or Bill O&#8217;Reilly. There&#8217;s a difference between NEWS reporting and opinion shows.</p>

					<p>Fox&#8217;s audience is far closer to the US populous (40% conservative, 40% independent and 20% liberal).   Based on Liberals desires for quotas and other government action to make things fair, you should embrace a more fair distribution of the American viewpoint.   A 36% Liberal share over represents the population by almost double.  Should they not be required to fix that?</p>
<p>Another point of Bias in point one.   &#8220;found its ideological mirror image in MSNBC&#8221;  Really, 46 to 6 versus 3 to 71.   Carnival mirror maybe.  Explains why journalists are journalists and not scientist or engineers.</p>
<p>Since media&#8217;s JOB is question those in power and be an advocate for the PEOPLE, their coverage should be neutral to slight negative for all of those in power.   This is why they were given protection in the Constitution.  The current propaganda arms of the administration are exposed by these numbers.</p>

					<p>Fox News is more legitimate than the others.  I am a news addict myself and I often hop from channel to channel. The programming after 7:00  est on weeknights is opinion-base. Daytime programming is news based. MSNBC is all about 90-95% opinion  and they&#8217;re slogan &#8220;Lean Forward&#8221; shows their progressive ideology.  Recently during a major event in the event Fox News broke into the opinion base show and  covered it. MSNBC was showing it prison lock down crap and CNN was had some investigative  48 hour-type of tape running.  Why is Fox News so expensive? Maybe because it is the only 24 hours news channel still running. MSNBC and CNN have people plugging in prerecorded programs. Fox News IS the only network that is fair and balance. They always have two major parties represented and in religious stories, they will have all the major faith represented.  Also there is faux fact going around saying the  Fox News viewer are ill informed and a less intelligent.  Don&#8217;t buy it.  Proof is watch the many  &#8220;man on the street&#8221; segments where a liberal leaning, college educated, adult who think &#8220;Benghazi&#8221; is the name of guy who works out in the gym, they can&#8217;t name the vice president, or know what month to vote in.  One more thing. The best investigative reporters in this biz is Catherine Herridge and Jennifer Griffin. who repeatedly scoop other reporters on the other networks.</p>

					<p>The best news of this whole article is number 4, that viewership is declining among cable news.  I was one of the original &#8216;CNN junkies&#8217; back in the 80&#8217;s, and have watched a fair amount of CNN and MSNBC since they came on the scene and can tell you that they&#8217;re all just a bunch of crap now.  It&#8217;s evidenced by Rupert Murdoch, when he divided up NewsCorp he put FoxNews on the entertainment side instead of the news side.  It&#8217;s all about ratings and getting scoops as opposed to actually providing the service of delivering news these days.</p>

					<p>Of course, a FOX, like you would behave in a way to divide rather than find common ground. Must you be reminded that Obama&#8217;s, dishonest America hating administration&#8221; as you ignorantly call it, won the election in 2008 and 2012, despite the surety on FOX that first McCain and then Romney were on the road to winning. There are some good things and good people at FOX, it&#8217;s their viewing audience that is too slow minded to know when there&#8217;s a FOX truth and the REAL truth. You can not have a political discussion with someone who ONLY watches FOX, their view is quite  skewed and the truth seems to not be their main goal. And if that isn&#8217;t enough, they all have the EXACT same talking points. In other words, every FOX watcher spews exactly the same thing, that is how it&#8217;s so easy to tell who they are and how little they actually know. Wasn&#8217;t their a PEW Research poll several years ago that concluded that the people who watch FOX know less about the news than people who watch no news at all?  Point made!</p>

					<p>You must be talking about yourself. Every Democratic Party candidate today is desperately trying to distance themselves from Obama, and refusing to admit if they even voted for him in hopes to get re-elected this year. </p>
<p>And Pew&#8217;s polls are largely internet based, aka &#8220;non-scientific&#8221;. Follow more reputable sources such as Nielsen ratings, to find out what people actually think. </p>
<p>Oh, and Fox News routinely does &#8220;on the street interviews&#8221; proving how uneducated and uninformed the public is. You might have known that if you weren&#8217;t what you fear.</p>

					<p>As a journalist, you should know better than to make your bias so obvious.</p>
<p>All writers know to put their most important point at the end of a report, a paragraph, and a sentence. That&#8217;s the point they want readers to leave with.</p>
<p>Re: &#8220;Fox still leads in audience, but that audience is smaller than it used to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>You could just as easily said, &#8220;Fox&#8217;s audience is smaller than it used to be, but it still leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which thought did you want readers to take away?</p>

					<p>Pew ideology (since Pew used the term first) by section headings.<br />
1.  Seems balanced since the report is about Fox<br />
2.  A.  Use of the word &#8220;skew&#8221; &#8212; the denotation of the word is correct but the connotation of the word &#8220;skew&#8221; is that it&#8217;s another word for &#8220;slant&#8221;<br />
     B.  Use of the word &#8220;ideological&#8221; &#8212; the word denotes some sort of acceptance of a set of principles of attitudes.  The word connotes rigid thinking that is apparently inimical to a perceived or desired change of attitudes, e.g. acceptance of homosexuality to thinking that homosexuality is healthy and cool.  Further it appears that conservatism is ideological whereas liberalism isn&#8217;t.<br />
3.  The use of the word &#8220;expensive&#8221; &#8212; per the numbers cited, the denotation of the word is correct.  However the word connotes that a Fox viewer isn&#8217;t getting his money&#8217;s worth.<br />
4.  The graph indicates that Fox is experiencing something akin to an &#8220;S&#8221; curve whereas the other news/opinion &#8212; take your pick &#8212; providers are on a receding linear track despite a growing population.  Briefly the heading was biased as not only Fox viewership was declining but fewer viewers were looking at the other providers.<br />
5.  &#8220;Fox outspends its rivals&#8221; Looks like a good old objective statement.<br />
My conclusion is that three of the five headings contained a message unfavorable to Fox.  Assuming I&#8217;m correct, should a reader read anything published by Pew with a grain or ton of salt?</p>

					<p>You are correct.  In fact, what the heck am I doing here reading this skewed article? Maybe more for reading pleasure than for search of facts. Thanks for pointing out the obvious.  Your response should be used as an example of critical thinking and provide discussion in a philosophy class.</p>

					<p>The fact is that there are many article on here stating that left-leaning news organizations like MSNBC contain more opinion than Fox. This article may use some negative connotations, but the foil articles on here condemning MSNBC seem to balance that.</p>

					<p>Pew is financed by right wing parties and publish right wing ideology. This is new-ish for Pew&#8230;.. but it&#8217;s not longer non-partisan. Arnold Foundation is putting up a lot of money to get Pew to discredit pensions&#8230;&#8230; follow the money.</p>

					<p>The mere fact that this article singles out Fox News for this kind of deconstruction manifests a clear bias.  </p>
<p>Read the book BIAS by Bernard Goldberg.<br />
and LEFT TURN by Tim Groseclose.<br />
These and others show the clear tilt of the News media to the left of the spectrum.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a Pew report that was written with the intent of proving Fox News is biased.  But what it accidentally proved is that Fox is actually the most balanced, giving both conservative AND liberal viewpoints.  And Fox only appears to &#8220;tilt right&#8221; when compared to the other networks that tilt overwhelmingly left!</p>

					<p>Dave, Suggest you also read What Liberal Media? by Eric Alterman and compare to BIAS. While Goldberg&#8217;s book is apparently only his thinking (no references, footnotes, etc), Alterman&#8217;s is a packed with source references you can fact-check. Having read both, if one&#8217;s to each with an open mind, one can&#8217;t help but view Alterman&#8217;s book as closer to the truth. My best, John</p>

					<p>I&#8217;d already heard of it, and It&#8217;s on my list of books to read,  thank you for the suggestion, John. </p>
<p>Apparently Groseclose and Alterman have dueled on the subject a few times.  By this commentary by Groseclose&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://ricochet.com/archives/political-views-of-journalists-my-feud-with-eric-alterman-part-2/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://ricochet.com/archives/political-views-of-journalists-my-feud-with-eric-alterman-part-2/', 'ricochet.com/archives/political-&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">ricochet.com/archives/political-&hellip;</a></p>
<p>&#8230;he offers more sourced and reliable facts for his work.  But I&#8217;d still like to see Alterman&#8217;s work, to see both sides.  </p>
<p>But when  50 years of polling shows that liberal journalists and editors SELF-IDENTIFY as overwhelmingly liberal at a ratio of about 80%, it would defy common sense to believe that news reporters didn&#8217;t tilt liberal.<br />

<p>Some of these polls are also cited by Goldberg in his BIAS book (pages (pages 115-136).</p>

					<p>It is worth pointing out, as you have, that &#8220;slant&#8221; is a synonym of &#8220;skew,&#8221; Fageol. But &#8220;skew&#8221; is a professional term for statistical analysis. And so stating that &#8220;The Fox News audience skews more ideological&#8221; means that a greater portion of the population of the audience tends to be in one group over the other groups studied, rather than the population of the audience being a &#8220;normal distribution&#8221; or a more equally portioned distribution between the studied groups (such as maybe 33%, 34%, 33%).</p>

					<p>My husband &amp; I are in our 70&#8217;s and are very concerned about our country and the total disregard of our values that made us so different and so loved b the rest of the world!  We have made our mistakes (slavery) and we are paying dearly, both in conscience and treasure.  It seems station other than Fox News want to focus on the African American president rather than the issues; the constitution, the huge debt, the minorities who are becoming as beholden to this govt. as they were to the massas on the plantations;  what a waste!!!!  As a conservative,Christian who loves her country and ALL our citizens; I want the truth and I believe Fox does also.  But to call us raciest is the worst insult.                                                                                                      Gail Tillman</p>

<p>And I hope you realize since Obama has a black father and a white mother he is just as much white as he is black&#8230;.&#8221;masses on the plantations&#8221;? Dear god, you are so entirely racist.</p>

					<p>My problem with Obama is not that he&#8217;s black.  It&#8217;s that the Democrats and the complicit media use the fact that Obama is black as a slander-weapon to discredit any valid criticism of Obama&#8217;s policies.</p>
<p>CONSERVATIVE: &#8220;Obama used the IRS to harass private citizens and 501 (c) (3) and (4) groups to prevent them from organizing political opposition in 2012, and thus unfairly won the election.  Obama was negligent before, during and after Benghazi and is still covering it up, and obstructing investigation.  NDAA 2012 and  NDAA 2013, allow Obama to declare martial law in peacetime.  The incredible failure of the Obamacare website, and low enrollment because of high cost and low coverage.  Obamacare is unconstitutional, and was passed into law in March 2010 despite that 53% of the U.S. opposed it, and the Democrats rammed it through anyway.  And that opposition rose to 56% a year after it passed, and is at least 56% on any day since it was implemented in Oct 2013.    Eric Holder&#8217;s open racism on multiple occasions, prosecuting only cases where minorities are the victims (so much for equal protection).  Eric Holder&#8217;s involvement in Fast and Furious gun-running to Mexican drug cartels, and obstruction of THAT investigation.  On and On.&#8221;</p>
<p>LIBERAL:  &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re just a racist who can&#8217;t handle that a black man is president.&#8221;</p>
<p>OH YES!  That&#8217;s SUCH a civil and factual response to legitimate criticism of Obama policies and failures.</p>
<p>Let me clue you in on where that tactic comes from: </p>
<p>&#8220;Members and front organizations must continually embarrass, discredit and degrade our critics.  When obstructionists become too irritating, label them as fascist or Nazi or anti-Semitic [or racist].  The association will, after enough repetition, become &#8216;fact&#8217; in the public mind.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Moscow Central Committee, 1943</p>
<p>Both of Obama&#8217;s parents were communists.<br />
Both of Obama&#8217;s grandparents who raised him after age 10 were far-left, if not Marxist.  Who introduced Obama to mentor Frank Marshall Davis, who was a Marxist &#8211;more than Marxist, a Stalinist, who was under constant investigation by the FBI.<br />
Obama&#8217;c closest advisor, Valerie Jarrett, is far-left if not Marxist, and her parents were closely associated with Frank Marshall Davis.<br />
Anitia Dunn (Obama&#8217;s first Communications director) :  Marxist.<br />
Mark Lloyd (Obama&#8217;s FCC czar) : Marxist.<br />
Ron Bloom (Obama&#8217;s transportation czar): Marxist.<br />
Obama is deeply indoctrinated in far-Left literature, and is so versed in Saul Alinsky, that his job for ACORN was to teach Alinsky&#8217;s &#8220;rules for radicals&#8221; Social Marxist tactics to classrooms full of &#8220;community organizers&#8221; like himself.  Community Organizer being the euphemistic term for Marxist agitator, professional demagogue.  Divisive tactics Obama has splintered the nation with since he became president.</p>
<p>THESE are the things we object to from Obama. It has nothing to do with his race.  Conservative Republicans love Allen West, Herman Cain, Dr Ben Carson, J.C. Watts, Mark Steele.  Conservatives for 20 years have been polled who they would like to run and in every election since 1992 have said Colin Powell.  If he only had wanted the job.<br />
So it is absolutely false to call Republicans &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is ALL about policy, ideology and character (or in Obama&#8217;s case, lack thereof).<br />
Stop slandering people who disagree with Obama (and you) on the ISSUES.</p>

					<p>People from other countries disrespect us because of Obama&#8217;s continual backtracking on US commitments and his words and actions (Poland and Czech missile defense, red line in the sand, Benghazi, mistreatment of Netanyahu, &#8220;rules of engagement&#8221; in Afghanistan, use of drones killing civilians over sovereign nations, etc.).</p>

					<p>&#8220;Other civilized countries&#8221; are completely dominated by the left to the point that they completely shut out any dissenting views.  Political Correctness/ Social Marxism on full display.   </p>
<p>Europe is dominated by socialist countries like France, the U.K., Germany and those of  Scandanavia.  A BBC executive openly boasted of his network&#8217;s bias against the U.S. during the Iraq war.<br />
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10158679/BBC-has-deep-liberal-bias-executive-admits.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10158679/BBC-has-deep-liberal-bias-executive-admits.html', 'telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandrad&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandrad&hellip;</a></p>
<p> Charlie Rose on his program asked Robert Kagan (who had just returned from Europe) back in 2004  why Europeans overwhelmingly opposed the U.S.-led war in Iraq against Saddam Hussein.  Kagan said: &#8220;Because never in the European media do they hear a pro-American point of view.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Pew Research is not exactly an honest broker when it comes to their so-called &#8216;projects&#8217; They are almost exclusively populated and funded by the left. Of course that doesn&#8217;t mean they would ever let their political bias leak into their &#8216;studies&#8217;-right?</p>

					<p>1. Fox News was very tough on the last Democratic candidate for president. (But MSNBC was even tougher on the Republican). </p>
<p>Yes Fox is biased toward the right.  And MSNBC is biased to the left.  Hardly startling.</p>
<p>2.The Fox News audience skews more ideological than that of its two main competitors.  The analysis says more about Pew than the fact does about Fox.  There are other possible deductions &#8211; perhaps more Liberals misidentify their positions as mainstream rather than Liberal.</p>
<p>3.Fox News is expensive.  The cable and satellite companies are not charities nor are they altruistic.  They are paying for what they see as the value of the audience that Fox brings.  If MSNBC could demand more fees, why would it not do so?</p>
<p>4. Fox still leads in audience, but that audience is smaller than it used to be.  This fact is true for all three channels in the graph and more so for MSNBC.  A neutral person might draw the conclusion that television viewership is moving to other technologies.</p>
<p>5. Fox outspends its rivals. If Fox outspends its rivals and it is receiving more licensing fees, one can conclude that its business plan is superior or &#8220;it takes money to make money.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Jesse,</p>
<p>A mechanical question:</p>
<p>I received with interest and respect the research done in FIVE FACTS ABOUT FOX NEWS.</p>
<p>But I was taken aback when I was immediately deluged by the outpouring of individual of the 107 comments. What I wanted &#8211; and thought I had asked for &#8211; was the neat summaries<br />
of the FIVE FACTS, in order. How should I have keyed my computer to receive what I wanted?</p>
<p>Thanks for an answer. I value Pew research products and find helpful in my own work.</p>

					<p>I have not turned on a TV in 9 years. I get everything from the internet. Those who wish to get their daily pablum fix of news get it from TV. With 85% of the MSM owned by International Corporations no rational person would believe what they hear on TV. The internet has a multitude of news sources with counter arguments, and coverage of many sides of the same story.</p>
<p>The TV is truly the &#8220;Idiot Box&#8221;.</p>

					<p>This country is so divided.  We should just the 47% of people who do nothing, the takers, let them move to California, let like paying taxes and supporting these clowns.<br />
Maybe I&#8217;ll become one of them.  With Diblasio running NY, it doesn&#8217;t pay to work anymore.<br />
Lets see:<br />
I can get Food Stamps, obamaphone, free medical, unemployment for 99 weeks, work off the books, free college(for those of us that can read).<br />
I now see why obama started out with a 47% lead.  It&#8217;s great to be given things!!!</p>

					<p>When this country stop talking about the left against the right; white against black; and Hispanics against everybody, gay against straight; Please grow up, cut the TVs off and do something productive like providing service without looking for something in return, we may become a better country.  Faux news and MSNBC have the same objective and are both bias.  The middle class needs to come together and stop acting like children and hold our government, big business and wall street accountable, because they are the ones that are truly raping us.</p>

					<p>The mere mention of &#8216;Obama phones&#8217; tells everyone who you listen to.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing, with all the real information out there, you completely ignore, because those you listen to never show you, all the free stuff from republicans that goes to our richest corporations and dwarfs the money going to welfare to the people.<br />

					<p>Because no one but conservative media will report and not selectively omit those facts?</p>
<p>&#8220;Penny the moocher&#8221; and the &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna get me an Obama phone&#8221; welfare-parasite woman can both be viewed on Youtube.  It&#8217;s not like Fox is the only network to run those clips.<br />
They&#8217;re manifestations of the attitude that has allowed welfare, disability and other handouts to unnecessarily double under Obama.</p>

					<p>Hey Jim,<br />
Get the facts. People have to be in a really low income bracket (poverty) to get food stamps, I don&#8217;t know of one poor person that has an &#8220;Obama Phone&#8221; More lies from fox, and I have employees without health care because as an small business I can&#8217;t afford to provide it for them. My own son has no health care. I don&#8217;t know where you get your information but I can guess. Also not every mother on welfare is a parasite. Talk about hatred, this is what watching Fox does to people. Glad I don&#8217;t watch it. Best part is all these haters and racists call themselves Christians.</p>

					<p>The main difference between Fox and MSNBC is that most people who watch MSNBC know that they are getting liberal opinion.  Much of the Fox news viewership isn&#8217;t aware that they are getting conservative opinion dressed up as news.  As to Fox allowing liberals to talk, with the exception of Juan Williams, most of the liberals Fox allows to talk are so completely out of touch that they are effectively straw men set up for the Fox news opinion hero of the hour to disassemble.</p>

					<p>No, MSNBC, especially Maddow and Hayes spends it&#8217;s time showing you, with facts and sources, that you&#8217;ve been given lies from conservative news. Fox and the limbaughs say something and MSNBC is forced to prove that it&#8217;s false.</p>

					<p>Exactly!  One of the things I like about Maddow show especially is how clips are shown from Fox, hannity etc where lies are told, and then showing with facts and figures that these are lies.</p>

					<p>There&#8217;s a pattern to these comments: the left-wing people seems to be critical of Fox News and cite their extensive, general experience watching news.  The right-wing people call the left-wing people &#8220;socialist&#8221; and when their evidence is called into question, simply ignore the matter and attack the questioner.  </p>
<p>The simple fact of the matter is that although MSNBC is harsher against specific people, FOX gives a general and harmful twist to their news.  They condemn the poor as &#8220;leachers&#8221; despite tax-shelters that the wealthy use.  Strangely enough their viewers sound more and more like extremist Islamic groups every year.</p>

					<p>Apparently you missed the many comments by myself and others citing facts and links to back up what we say, WAY beyond snarky remarks like yours.</p>
<p>In polls for the last 50 years, news reporters and editors have consistently SELF-IDENTIFIED as overwhelmingly liberal.<br />

<p>I could hurl insults like yourself, but I prefer to let the facts speak for themselves. </p>
<p>Your comment that Fox News calls people &#8220;leachers&#8221; proves that you don&#8217;t actually watch Fox, you just watch soundbytes of it twisted to DEMAGOGUE Fox, on some liberal spin site like Media Matters, DailyKos, Raw, or MSNBC.<br />
What commentators on Fox say is that the Democrats cultivate a culture of welfare dependency, and that the more people Democrats get on food stamps, disability, and other forms of assistance, the more reliable voters the DNC has.<br />
Are you blind to the fact that Obama&#8217;s government now runs COMMERCIALS SOLICITING food stamps and disability?<br />
That welfare and food stamp dependency have doubled in just Obama&#8217;s first term?  That welfare dependency is rising despite an alleged economic recovery?   What&#8217;s wrong with this picture?<br />
Commentators on Fox (given equal time with liberals who offer opposing views) assert that this socialist-cultivated widening of dependency is discouraging the work ethic that built this country, and sapping the American spirit.  </p>
<p>When conservatives here call liberal journalists &#8220;socialist&#8221;, it is precisely because they are of a well intended but flawed European-socialist mentality.  And these benign types at the grassroots level are unwittingly guided by leadership that is far less benign, and far more anti-capitalist/anti-Western/anti-American.<br />

<p>It is a precise plan termed Social Marxism or Political Correctness:<br />

<p>And it is a plan that began with a Marxist group called the Frankfurt School in the 1930&#8217;s that fully emerged as the 1960&#8217;s cultural revolution.</p>

					<p>I know people personally who work three jobs and still need food stamps after corporations scheme to implement business models where no employee even receives full time hours. My girlfriend worked for six months at a fast food job where she was constantly called in to perform work duties on her days off and she ended up, after the six months having a ytd pay of 1400 dollars. Don&#8217;t tell me that hard working people are moochers just because corporations are unwilling to let people buy the things they need and still have money left over. They try to squeeze every dime out of the consumer while hiding their earnings in offshore tax shelters, all the while decrying the fact that the funneling of money out of the economy is a major cause of the massive need for welfare in the first place.</p>

					<p>Truth be told&#8230;..The network channels are losing viewers every second, I for one, no longer watch network news.  Most if not all news programs resemble &#8220;reality shows&#8221;, nothing but brainless rubbish.  If it wasn&#8217;t for the comedy channel and sports, I would get rid of my TV channel service in a New York minute. No wonder Netflix is becoming so popular.</p>

					<p>All three are so fixed with little change in format, thought in addition to having the same &#8220;pundits&#8221; on so frequently that I think I can tell you what they will say before they say it.

					<p>A very useful survey by Pew. It would have been interesting to throw a few other news organizations into the mix, however, like the Washington Post, Al-Jazeera, The Atlantic, CNBC, Mother Jones, Media Matters and the Moscow Times, all of which I also follow. I&#8217;m very conservative (at least according to the recent Time survey <a href="http://science.time.com/2014/01/09/can-time-predict-your-politics/?xid=newsletter-weekly" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://science.time.com/2014/01/09/can-time-predict-your-politics/?xid=newsletter-weekly', 'science.time.com/2014/01/09/can-&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">science.time.com/2014/01/09/can-&hellip;</a> ), but frankly, I find Limbaugh, O&#8217;Reilly and Hannity almost completely worthless as sources of actual news. Anyone who gets their news and commentary from them is just seeking to confirm previously held views, or to get an update on the latest fake right wing meme. Maddow is a different story. She has her hobby horses, such as LGBT issues and reproductive rights, and I usually switch channels when she is talking about these subjects. In contrast to the far-right pundits, however, when Maddow comments on other topics like Benghazi, voter rights, corruption in government, etc., she is very watchable and has a lot of interesting things to say. Other MSNBC pundits like Chris Matthews are hyper-ideological and a little bit goes a long way. However, I do very much like Alex Wagner and Andrea Mitchell (the female mayor of &#8220;This Town&#8221;). I do read the NYT religiously &#8212; it&#8217;s just better at covering the news than anyone else, even though I think the editorial board should get its collective head examined. I was surprised at how close WSJ and MSNBC were on the ideology of their viewers &#8212; something I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed. Lots to learn here.</p>

					<p>Actually, in the past I have fact-checked various stories from both sources.  Like them or  not, MSNBC is nearly always verifiable.  Fox, on the other hand, were inaccurate (and in some instances, downright lying) on numerous instances. Learning that for myself is part of the reason I find them so reprehensible.  I may not agree with certain slants from both sources, but one absolutely fudges the truth more than other.</p>

					<p>When all the &#8220;factcheck&#8221; sites such as the Washington Post are as left-leaning as the New York Times itself, I can see where you would walk away with that impression.  </p>
<p>While they do factcheck a percentage of stories on the liberal/Democrat side, they seem fixated on proving the conservatives are wrong.<br />

<p>Hiding behind an image of neutral objectivity.  But still liberal journalists, tilting the news with their brethren.  Forward!</p>

					<p>I notice the decline angle of viewership is identical , indicating no one is &#8220;leaving&#8221; Fox News as much as a lot of people get tired of seeing the same videos run with same comments  constantly all day on Fox OR the MSM. To me that is healthy as it just means they check back to make sure there isn&#8217;t new news occasionally. </p>
<p>All the people below worrying about slant are simply worried about hearing truth&#8230;If the Station does not come up ( or down )  to their personal ideas of truth.</p>
<p>Message to YOU people: There is a LOT of negative truth about President Obama and his agendas.    BY the way,don&#8217;t bother to foam up on me here as I am a &#8220;Fire and Forget&#8221; and do not care one bit  if the truth hurts feelings&#8230; and I won&#8217;t be back to read your screed.  :-})</p>

					<p>The few times I have watched Fox News I have seen not just opinions that I disagree with, but frequently manipulated quotes or video clips which when presented on other News sources &#8216;in toto&#8217; demonstrates an affinity for fabrication or as Tennessee Williams wrote in one of his plays; &#8220;A distinct odor of mendacity.&#8221;<br />
I do not see that happening on CNN, MSNBC or usually the three networks. And when they do present something that is less than completely accurate they almost always present an apology and a correction.</p>

					<p>Charlie,<br />
I don&#8217;t suppose you remember NBC and MSNBC cutting and manipulating audio of George Zimmerman to make it sound like he stated the subject he was observing was black? What these two fine &#8216;news&#8217; outlets did was cut the part where Zimmerman is asked if the subject is white, Hispanic or black. They of course got busted, after they broadcast this &#8216;mendacity&#8217; and were forced to correct their slant on reporting. I guess that makes it OK.<br />
Charlie, If I had to guess, I would say you lean left. (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with it.)</p>

					<p>And to Charlie&#8217;s point, there was an acknowledgement, apology and consequence as a result of the edited content in question. And there is where the glaring difference between the networks lies. FOX has made manipulating video and audio into an art form. There are countless examples of this. People like John Stewart routinely expose this by simply showing how FOX anchors present the information, followed by the exact same content shown its entirety, creating a thing called, &#8220;context.&#8221; And guess what? Always a different picture when viewed this way. But with hours and hours of examples of this, how many people have lost their jobs at FOX? How many apologies have been issued? Keith Olbermann was fired. Martin Bashir was fired. The producer who made the decision to edit and run with the Zimmerman audio was fired. Why does NBC hold people accountable for misinformation or &#8220;egregious&#8221; statements, but FOX does not?</p>

					<p>Wow. You really don&#8217;t know what &#8220;unbiased&#8221; means, do you? NPR and PBS are not &#8220;unbiased.&#8221; They are not even &#8220;liberal.&#8221; They are both &#8220;far-left liberal,&#8221; and the closest you can get to &#8220;socialist&#8221; and still be American.

					<p>I read the Fox story and was struck (but not stunned) by the clearly negative tone.<br />
You even slanted the good news negatively.<br />
Just two examples.<br />
You headlined Fox leads  in cable audience but its audience is down.<br />
Truth:In fact virtually add TV audiences are down -cable and over the air.<br />
You headlined with Fox costs more to view and it spends more.<br />
Truth: Fox leads in audience because it invests more in people and programming.</p>
<p>I sometimes hear people say &#8220;Pew is non-partisan.&#8221; I did some research awhile ago and found your funding is from mostly liberal sources.</p>
<p>I guess stories like this is how you pay the piper.</p>

					<p>what i respect about watching the PBS News Hour every evening is that it is a balanced report with in depth interviews from people from both sides of the political environment on a certain situation being discussed.  They have no commercials so are not under any entities pressure and since they don&#8217;t have commercials and that the news is an hour long, you get much more news and like i said, more in depth coverage on the news of the day.</p>

					<p>I agree 100%. Why can the news not cease political correctness/ If it is a lie call it a lie not spin&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;It is time for Americans to demand their tax dollars no longer go to PBS ect. after they have advertisers also.

					<p>I&#8217;d like to see &#8220;pure&#8221; reporting from my news.  I don&#8217;t want my agenda, nor anyone else&#8217;s to be in focus, but pure truth.  I&#8217;d like to see FOX start a Sunday evening program that would rival 60Minutes, with something along the lines of the &#8220;State of our Union&#8221;.  In other words, a very simple portrayal of our &#8220;real&#8221; government.  Where is our money going?  Why? Why? and Why? do we have such a huge deficit and budget? Stories of present government, stories of our past government who spent tomorrows money then, and in effect, got us into the bind we are now?  Why don&#8217;t we have a reporting card for our politician&#8217;s actions?<br />
WHY ARE THE SO CALLED REPORTERS, NOT REPORTING!?!?!?!?<br />
Really, I think though they spend a lot of time looking good on TV, they would do much better at their jobs if they spent as much time doing their jobs.<br />
I think the politician&#8217;s are smarter than they are.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Liberal press&#8221; &#8230; really????   If you have not figured it out by now, every &#8220;news&#8221; media outlet (besides PBS) has a corporate owner who spews their political views on the rest of us.  Fox News Pres. Roger Ailes has admitted that Fox News is his opinion in a news format (not real news, just opinion). That&#8217;s your conservative media at work. Others have a liberal bias (MSNBC) that can be called Liberal media. But almost all media is corporate, not liberal or conservative, corporate with their CEO&#8217;s opinion spun as news.  Wake up!!!</p>

					<p>What is most noticeable is the almost total absence of news and opinion from outside the USA. What coverage there is features war and US involvement or possible involvement. There is almost nothing about daily life in other countries or politics in other countries. If there is no natural disaster or other catastrophe and no civil war or terrorist action there is no coverage. American political life is so dysfunctional and so naturally complicated  there is little room for anything else but football.</p>
<p>By the way, if America did not spend US$1trillion annually on defence and defence related expenditures the country would not be in the debt situation it is in now.</p>

					<p>We&#8217;ve significantly reduced our defense spending since Obama&#8217;s been in office, and yet we&#8217;re still adding 1tril every year to our debt. It&#8217;s the careless government spending on programs and regulations that do nothing but hinder small business and growth. Socialized healthcare, high taxes, and less state power is what is hurting this country right now. If you don&#8217;t believe me, do research on the European countries and why they&#8217;re in such bad shape. Plus, we NEED defense to protect ourselves from Putins and BinLadins otherwise we won&#8217;t pose a threat to our enemies and (eventually) will push war. Look at what just happened in Crimea (This is only the beginning)</p>

					<p>re: viewership. what are the numbers for the networks. I include PBS with CBS, NBC and ABC.  Quite a few people like me do not even have Cable or satellite and are glad of it.</p>
<p>I know that PBS draws 3 million but I don&#8217;t know if that is every evening or what.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what PBS spends on News but I know it buys rights to programing from Independent Television News and other world wide networks. I watch a variety of news programs daily and read others and think I get a fairly good picture of what is going on. I don&#8217;t think any cable stations do a very good job of covering important issues and occurrences of the day.</p>

					<p>In 2012, about 22 million people watched one of the evening broadcast network (ABC, CBS, NBC) news programs. More on that here: <a href="http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/network-news-a-year-of-change-and-challenge-at-nbc/network-by-the-numbers/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/network-news-a-year-of-change-and-challenge-at-nbc/network-by-the-numbers/', 'stateofthemedia.org/2013/network&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">stateofthemedia.org/2013/network&hellip;</a>. </p>

					<p>Apparently Fox owns direct tv, a good reason to switch to another provider.  The conservative audience sells themselves so cheaply.  All one has to do to get applause is to denigrate Obama.  Many prefer bad government to gay marriage or legal abortion.  They embrace the views of the billionaires while they don&#8217;t have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.  Voting according to ones economic interest makes some sense. Voting for low taxes for the rich makes no sense at all.  Trickledown is a testable theory. When it is tested against history it fails.  Trickle down is really nothing more than the idea that the majority should be satisfied with crumbs from the tables of the rich.  Before one of you calls me a communist or a socialist you should know that I am a life long Republican and a former Republican operative.  My first vote was caste for Dwight Eisenhower.  Think!</p>

					<p>As unsupported your claim is Wayne, that Mark Twain quote truly describes the premise of how the media reports to it&#8217;s viewers and alone on how people believe. There is such a thing as political bias and propaganda that the government enforces to control the masses and votes. I&#8217;m talking about NBC, PBS, ABC, and CNN too. First off, cable is free (funded by the government) which ABC, NBC, and PBS report on. You in turn can&#8217;t compare views to that of cable news since it&#8217;s &#8216;Cable&#8217; and it&#8217;s free. The bias is very well hidden too, but all you have to do is ask the questions those outlets aren&#8217;t answering. Their reports are based on Pathos (Emotion) instead of Logos (Logic).</p>

					<p>I have never much liked CNN after what they did to Lou Dobbs.  They let the open border organizations influence Dobbs leaving.  Claiming he  was raciest when Dobbs wife is Hispanic and and all of his children speak Spanish. Dobbs was paid well when he left and I watch his show every day on Fox News. I also like the Kelly File.  For my money I&#8217;m sticking with Fox News.</p>

					<p>We agree on at least one thing Margaret; I wish I could pick and choose as well. If that were the case I would drop MSNBC and Al Jeezera America, and probably CNN until they get rid of Piers Morgan. Look at their pathetic viewership; do you think if the FOX viewers could drop them from their subscription cost that these networks could keep the lights on? I don&#8217;t&#8230;except for Al Jeezera because they are privately funded to be a tool of propaganda and they do not exist to make a profit.</p>
<p>As far as FOX&#8217;s subscription cost, I think I speak for most viewers when I say that .89 cents is likely the best value for the money we spend in any given month and I would gladly pay many times more. They are beating the pants off the competition with nearly 3x the viewership, which shows the demand; why shouldn&#8217;t they command more than a poorly performing network?</p>
<p>On the content of the viewership, it looks to me like the number skew to the left as you go down the list toward Rachel Madow, but it&#8217;s not as pronounced&#8230;in my opinion because many more liberals(than conservatives) don&#8217;t consider themselves as such and would like to consider themselves moderate/independents.(this comes from a general lack of knowledge and a failure develop fully formed opinions that are based on current facts about the world in which they live which in turn allows them to be incredibly flexible in their beliefs and easily manipulated.) It is also my belief that many more liberals get their news from John Stewart and similar sources, rather than put 30 minutes a week into any &#8220;serious&#8221; news source no matter what bent it may be. Let&#8217;s not forget the liberal du jour who&#8217;s political concerns are summed up with &#8220;legalize it&#8221;.</p>

					<p>Fox news is fair and balanced in the sense that the hosts frequently have liberal guests who at times offer stiff arguments and rebuttals. Compare that with MSNBC that very seldom if ever present divergent commentary from conservatives. The MSNBC guests are mostly toadies who are echo chambers for the progressive agenda.</p>

					<p>Robert, All I can say is, &#8220;That&#8217;s how you see it.&#8221;   FOX News says what you want to hear.<br />
And to me, they report it your way and hope they don&#8217;t get caught in their embellished, or<br />
dubious truths.  </p>
<p>I find them to be dangerous, only because less educated actually believe they are hearing factual news.</p>

					<p>Carolyn, it seems to me that you have your facts wrong. The lower class and low middle-class will vote for a POTUS for race only, believe whatever he says and never question, and only watch CNN and/or MSNBC (NBC) because they do not have to listen to any other side. All I wish is that people would take time to find the facts themselves, listen to CNN evening one day and Fox News evening the next day. THEN, make an informed decision about what they believe to be the truth. Believe me! we have a president whom is a pro at skewing the truth.</p>

					<p>Pat has it exactly right, Carolyn. Everything you said is true of MSNBC to a &#8220;T&#8221;. I will bet 2 things: You are a Liberal and voted for Obama; you never watch FOX News. If you did, you would hear the likes of Juan Williams and several other Liberals every single day debating along with Conservative thinkers. It is you that is biased and follow Liberalism/Progressiveness with blinders on so as not to hear the other side. If you really love your country, then it is your duty to listen OPENLY to both sides and make educated decisions. If you are African American, I can tell you flat out that there is no racism in the Republican Party (except for the odd lowlife who probably does not vote anyhow). There are any number of African Americans that I would vote for for President (e.g., Condie Rice, Collen Powell, Dr. Ben Carson, etc.) but not Barack Obama who is not even an African American. His ancestors were not slaves but, in fact, were Arabs who WERE the slave traders. He has openly spurned the USA and is bent on changing it to a socialistic system. FYI, The Republican Party came into being just before the Civil War with one and only one platform, &#8216;to free the slaves&#8217;. They elected the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, (who, of course, did free the slaves) and the Democrats, who were completely against freeing the slaves, founded the Ku Klux Klan to maliciously torture and kill Blacks in an attempt to keep them in slavery. &#8220;He who refuses to study the past is doomed to repeat it.&#8221; (Santayana)</p>

					<p>Wayne, spot on conjecture about how the Republican party started. And with the Democrats too after the Civil War. It&#8217;s such a shame to see our fellow Americans not understand our history, how we became the world power, and what our fundamental government belief is. I can&#8217;t wait for the new generation of GOP (Grand Old Party of 1776) as it stands for individual freedoms, liberty, less government power, and that we are endowed by certain unalienable rights that this country cannot take away. Remember kids, these cooks up in Washington work for us and not the other way around. Working for government is a public service and not a career like some have made it out to be&#8230; (Harry Reid)</p>

					<p>I am very incredulous about the statistic stated in this article that 32% of MSNBC viewers are Conservative. I am not even a full Conservative and I could not stand to listen the manure that comes out of the mouths of their sophomoric commentators. Does anyone know if PEW Research has a bias? Of course, facts are facts, but they can be skewed as shown so openly by Liberals/Progressives.</p>

					<p>Agreed!  The MSNBC numbers don&#8217;t make sense as far as conservatives are concerned.  Something skewed the data.  I can buy that CNN is flat across the spectrum but even that seems &#8220;iffy&#8221; based on news content.</p>

					<p>This is the survey that stat came from <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/27/section-4-demographics-and-political-views-of-news-audiences/', 'people-press.org/2012/09/27/sect&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">people-press.org/2012/09/27/sect&hellip;</a>. The finding about MSNBC viewers might possibly be explained, in part, by the fact that 35% of the total adult population self-identify as conservative, while just 22% self-ID as liberal.</p>

					<p>1. 46% of Obama&#8217;s coverage on FOX was negative; 71% of Romney&#8217;s coverage on MSNBC was negative. (According to PEW) That amounts to an ideological mirror image? Not very accurate.<br />
2.Missing are the stats for negatives and positives on Romney at FOX and Obama at MSNBC.</p>
<p>If conclusions are to be drawn and comparisons made, the stats should be complete. Otherwise you are just playing with the figures to support your own pre-conceived conclusions.</p>

					<p>Vic, here are some more numbers. 6% of Obama&#8217;s Fox coverage was positive, while 3% of Romney&#8217;s MSNBC coverage was positive. MSNBC&#8217;s Obama coverage was 39% positive/15% negative, and Fox&#8217;s Romney coverage was 28% positive/12% negative. Here&#8217;s another study during the campaign period that suggests similar patterns of coverage: <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2012/08/23/master-narratives-sector/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.journalism.org/2012/08/23/master-narratives-sector/', 'journalism.org/2012/08/23/master&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">journalism.org/2012/08/23/master&hellip;</a>.</p>

					<p>I used to watch MSNBC and CNN all the time&#8230;I was a progressive liberal and worked on many issues, wrote white papers, helped candidates get elected, etc. I drank the Kool-Aid. But, I was warped to have thought Chris Mathews had a legitimate perspective on politics and matters of the day. Yes, I know, he has a &#8220;thing&#8221; for Obama and waves the president&#8217;s flag on a daily basis. Most every anchor on MSNBC screams the liberal mantra and takes pot-shots at conservative thinking. But, it is moderate and conservative thinking the country needs to solve problems, not the left-wing rants that do nothing but beg for more of my money to support social programs that continue to take us further into debt. And so, as an Independent, I listen to Fox News and get a &#8211; mostly &#8211; fair and balanced presentation of the situation. Suggest you do the same.</p>

					<p>Fox calls themselves Fair and Balanced. They have the entire right of center all to themselves. That is the rub.  Fox is no where near fair and balanced but their audience refuses to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>The rest of alphabet soup of news groups (ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, etc) divide up the balance. MSNBC does not portray itself as anything but liberal.  So yes Faux news has the largest share but by no means a majority.</p>
<p>Over all, Jon Stewart is better at pointing out the hypocritical nature of all the networks.  He picks on Faux because it is so easy.</p>

I don&#8217;t believe Dan implied that Jon Stewart presented the news.  He clearly stated that Jon Stewart excelled at pointing out the hypocricy of ALL the news outlets.  You see, that is called satire, humor, and/or entertainment.  Too stupid to vote, yet undoubtedly voted, eh? Which one is it, Einstein?</p>

					<p>Always a good point to make. Those 3 million&#8211;we call them &#8216;appointment&#8217; viewers&#8211; are far fewer even than the number who watch the major broadcast network newscasts. But among more casual cable news viewers (those who watch as little as 60 mins/month) there are actually quite a few (see this chart: <a href="http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/cable-a-growing-medium-reaching-its-ceiling/8_cable_cnn-holds-smaller-edge-among-cume-viewers-who-watch-more-often/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://stateofthemedia.org/2013/cable-a-growing-medium-reaching-its-ceiling/8_cable_cnn-holds-smaller-edge-among-cume-viewers-who-watch-more-often/', 'stateofthemedia.org/2013/cable-a&hellip;');" rel="nofollow">stateofthemedia.org/2013/cable-a&hellip;</a>).</p>

					<p>This must stop; because they are wealthy and disagree with you does not make them fascists. The Clintons have become enormously (and mysteriously) wealthy but I would never call them fascists: crooks, yes, but not fascists. What about George Soros who extorted money from Jews during the Holocaust? How about most of Hollywood who pays itself millions but leaves the unnamed talent penniless? How about the Pelosis and their peculiar financial status. Shame on you!</p>

					<p>Re #2: Since these respondents self-describe their leanings, with no independent means to verify their claims, could this mean that Foxers are more forthright in their self-descriptions? Could it mean that MSNBC audience have a different yardstick from Foxers on what views are &#8220;moderate&#8221; or &#8220;liberal&#8221;?</p>
<p>Re #3: Perhaps Fox and its supporters should factor in its 5X(!) cost differential over MSNBC when complaining that too few markets accept (&#8220;purchase&#8221;) Fox&#8217;s coverage.<br />
   &#8230;Yet one must wonder who subsidizes the rest of MSNBC&#8217;s costs, and why. </p>
<p>Re #4:  That audience majority drubbing,  and of course Fox&#8217;s politics, explain why—almost unprecedented in history—a sitting president repeatedly singled out one network and its audience to publicly ridicule.</p>
<p>Re #5: Can the 2.8X expenses differential between Fox and MSNBC owe partially to Fox&#8217;s more-extensive on-site research and fact-checking?<br />
   Pulling blog and web stories is cheaper than sending a reporter to gather facts on the ground.</p>

					<p>MSNBC&#8217;s reported news-related expenses are low, in part, because the channel draws on the larger news-gathering resources of NBC News.</p>

					<p>The cost per subscriber is very misleading.  Since Fox News has a much higher viewership than CNN or MSNBC one would expect a significantly higher cost.  It is also unfair to say that Fox and MSNBC are mirror images of each other.  Recently we have seen an MSNBC host tossed off the air for vile remarks and another host making a tearful apology for making fun of a Romney grandchild (she should have been fired).  To make things worse, MSNBC has given an hour show to Al Sharpton, an anti-Semite with blood on his hands, who has a long record of racial demagoguery.  I believe this whole story was justa hit piece, Pew should be ashamed.</p>

					<p>Your quote about mirror image of Fox shows your prejudice.  Really..msnbc isnt just one sided,  they flat out lie.  </p>
<p>Fox is more conservative, but they have democrats and liberals on their news shows.  Obama and his white house have tried to bully them for years.  They even lied about a fox reporter and tapped his parents phone.  They have harassed Sarah Palin&#8217;s father since she became veep candidate.  Why would anyone be for this lying President that we have.  He is a bully and uses the IRS to harass anyone who donated to Romney.  He has always been a zealot who has lied about his life.  He was a prince remember, or so he told one of his high school friends.</p>
<p>There is a big difference betweem 49% negative and 90% negative.  That is a skewed image along the order of Ed Schultz yelling, &#8220;there are no glitches with the health care web site.  Fox is not a shill for the Republicans .  If you have ever warched either Bret or Mike wallace,  they ask very difficult questions of Repulblicans all the time.  The other networks don&#8217;t even talk to conservatives, only progressive (and I don&#8217;t mean that in a kind way) republicans.  CNN has a few who will ask question, but look at the lap dog press.  The facts maam have nothing to do with reality.  Your comment disgusted me.  Are there any fair media and poll takers in this country.  Just the lying media that<br />
 doesnt tell the truth about any democrat ever.  And they don&#8217;t tell the truth about the fed, the economy, unemployment, Benghazi,  Eric Holder, the IRS, or Obamacare.  Fox helps to keep them honest.  That is why they have more viewers than the others combined.  By the way, it is playoff time, golf is back, tennis in Australia, college basketball, etc etc etc&#8230;just wait until we get closer to the elections.  Fox will be running even network tv into the ground.</p>

					<p>I admit I watch more FOX than any of the others, but there are MANY times on FOX when I look at what they are presenting and thinking, &#8220;Who told them that this item was news?&#8221;  Interviewing celebrities or talking with mothers and children about some social event, then not saying anything about what is happening in Iran, Iraq, or Afghanistan (where we still have military personnel in harms way) does not make me feel that they are covering the news.  On the other hand, when they cover the left wing Republican party, or the Socialist Democrats activities, that qualifies as news.  Maybe that is why i watch.  I do use shortwave radio to hear how the British, Germans, Canadians, and others cover a story that may not be covered by ANY news agency here, and there is a significant amount of news that the US will never hear about.  How very sad.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s not about Fox or MSNBC or CNN. Over 90% of all media is now owned by 6 corporations. </p>
<p>G.E.<br />
Newscorp<br />
Disney<br />
Viacom<br />
Time-Warner<br />
C.B.S.</p>
<p>Folks, wake up. It&#8217;s about oligarchy, corporatocracy, the military-industrial complex, and the near-complete domination of lawmaking by industrial lobbies. The &#8220;left&#8221; and the &#8220;right&#8221; are now all part of &#8220;the 1%&#8221; &#8212; the primary role of all corporate media is to keep is believing otherwise.</p>

					<p>What about Koch Industries and their affiliates? I just heard a report that they are investing in data mining and will be poised to truly affect the political arena (more so than now) in 2016.</p>

look it up.<br />
Canada refuses to air the Fox channel.<br />

					<p>Is it just me, or does none of these address &#8220;The Five&#8221;? And isn&#8217;t this rather uninteresting? None if this is juicy. Perhaps I&#8217;m the problem, expecting juicy news bits, but Fox just offers such a smorgasbord of journalistic failure, I&#8217;m disappointed at mere lameness and mediocrity.</p>

					<p>It really doesn&#8217;t matter when, where or who you get your news from.<br />
If you do not check yours and their sources and establish when and where THEY got their information you are wasting your time.<br />
I believe that more than 80% of ALL news news on the internet, and it could be 90%, is a reprint of PR releases from organizations that want you to see things their way.<br />
As long as the &#8220;General Public&#8221; continues to watch and accept &#8220;Filtered News&#8221; factual information will  require the INDIVIDUAL to do their own research and seek out any Real Facts.<br />
I believe that this phenomenon has reached such a peak that most folks never get past headlines or sound bites.</p>

					<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more!  I&#8217;ve been complaining about this very fact to my husband who is addicted to Fox (just like Fox wants him to be).  However, when I made it a point to watch other news channels to get some different points of view, I realized that ALL the channels are simply PUSHING THEIR OWN AGENDAS&#8230;whether it&#8217;s validating climate change (MSNBC), proving that Hillary is untrustworthy (Fox), etc&#8230;</p>

					<p>The American press is a corrupt agenda driven institution dismissive of the average American and his concerns. Members of the press are overwhelmingly elitist liberals who believe their job is to guide the legislative and social agenda in the direction they wish. I was a long time New York<br />
Times reader and CNN viewer, but as those media sources became less trustworthy and more agenda driven I changed my news consuming habits. Thankfully today with talk radio FOX news and the Internet I have many choices about where to gather news and information? Rather than spending so much time worrying why the Fox news Channel is popular the press needs to ask itself how they lost people like me as readers and viewers</p>

					<p>If you like your opinions handed to you, Fox is the place. Fox will massage, twist, spin, doctor and create out of whole cloth all the news you want to hear. Fox remains the primary source of the recession.</p>

					<p>EB &#8211; All cable &amp; network news spoon feed their audiences nowdays and push an agenda. So really what you have a problem with is Fox News pushing a non-liberal agenda. As Mendo said, use multiple outlets and research their sources to get to the truth. Perhaps if you did that a little, you would realize just how absurd you sound blaming a single cable news station as the PRIMARY source of the recession.</p>
