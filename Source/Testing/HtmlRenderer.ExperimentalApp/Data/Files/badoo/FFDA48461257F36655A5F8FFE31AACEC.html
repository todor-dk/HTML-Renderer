So with literally twice as many singles on the dating platform than there are in all of the country, how do you know if someone is who they say they are? Badoo, which is three times larger than Tinder and is one of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/140819-these-are-the-best-rated-dating-apps-of-2016">t</a><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/140819-these-are-the-best-rated-dating-apps-of-2016">he highest-rated dating apps of 2016</a>, is making that process a whole lot easier by being the first to eliminate catfishing instantly. Yes, this may take away your #LifeGoal of getting to meet <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/147046-leuh-justin-finally-meet-on-catfish-but-nev-max-had-to-take-a-huge">Max and Nev</a>, but I'm going to guess it'll probably be better for your love life.</p>
<p>Today, the <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/badoo-meet-new-people-chat/id351331194?mt=8">app is launching a new feature</a> that guarantees your match is using a real photo of themselves. The network acquired <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/51692-lulu-apps-truth-bombs-feature-lets-you-anonymously-ask-men-about-sex-and-relationships">Lulu</a> last month and named its founder, Alexandra Chong, the new President of Badoo. I sat down with Chong to learn more about the new feature and their female-focused agenda.</p>
<p>"We're releasing photo verification, so we're eliminating that sense that these are not real people or they're not presenting as real as they should be," Chong tells Bustle. "Women receive 4x as many messages, connections, and contact as men do — and what happens then is it becomes a chore. It's no longer fun."</p>
<p>She lists <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/149528-heres-how-many-millennials-have-been-ghosted-by-someone-they-were-dating">ghosting</a>, fake profiles, and catfishing as some of women's biggest online dating frustrations and concerns, along with being strapped for time — and I couldn't agree more. "My focus as president is to carry on the mission on Lulu and focus on making online dating better for women," Chong says. "There are a lot of things we're going to be rolling out to coincide with that. The space is definitely recognizing that women need to be behind these companies because we're more than 50 percent of these audiences."</p>
<p>With safety and efficiency at the forefront of their dating platform, she hopes women can get on the app and just enjoy the experience. Here's what you need to know about Badoo Photo Verification, because it's quick and easy AF :</p>
<h2>How To Get Your Photo Verified:</h2>
<div><attachment data-provider-id="uploads/820/7164e890-d4c4-0133-8300-06e18a8a4ae5.png" data-provider="upload" data-type="image" data-content='&lt;div class="article-body-image" data-attachment-id="728753"&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-image-view"&gt;&lt;img src="http://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/820/7164e890-d4c4-0133-8300-06e18a8a4ae5.png?w=780&amp;fit=max&amp;q=70"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' data-attribution="" contenteditable="false"><img data-src="http://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/820/7164e890-d4c4-0133-8300-06e18a8a4ae5.png?w=320"/><noscript><img src="http://lovelace-media.imgix.net/uploads/820/7164e890-d4c4-0133-8300-06e18a8a4ae5.png?w=320"/></noscript></attachment></div>
<p>In order to have your photo verified, you'll be asked to take a selfie with a unique pose. Badoo will then make sure it's you (by looking at the other photos on your profile) and that you've done the unique pose or not. You may even be asked to do another pose. I like this because it also encourages people to use <i>current</i> photos of themselves on their profiles.</p>
<h2>It Takes One Minute To Get Verified</h2>
<p>With a team of over 5,000 moderators worldwide, verifying a photo will happen instantly.</p>
<h2>
Users Can Opt To Only Chat With Verified Users</h2>

<p>Kate has the right idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>It'll Make Your Online Dating Experience More Efficient</h2>
<p>By only opting to chat with users who are verified, you'll save yourself the time and energy of having to make sure your match isn't misrepresenting themselves and focus on having fun. Cheers to that!</p>
