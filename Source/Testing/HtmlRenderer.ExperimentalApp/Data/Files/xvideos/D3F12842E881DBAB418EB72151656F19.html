only. You further agree that you will not:</p>

<ul>
	<li>submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to

<p class="paragraph">C. We do not endorse any user Submission, and expressly disclaim any and all liability in
connection with user Submissions. Xvideos does not permit copyright infringing activities
or infringement of intellectual property rights on its Website, and will promptly remove
content if <a href="http://support.xvideos.com/takedown/">properly notified of infringements</a> on third parties' intellectual property
rights. Repeat copyright infringers will have their user access to the Website terminated.
Read about our <strong><a href="http://info.xvideos.com/legal/repeat/">repeat infringers policy here</a></strong>.</p>

<p class="paragraph">If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user Submission or
other content infringes upon your rights, you may submit a takedown request with <a href="http://support.xvideos.com/takedown/">this form</a>
containing the following information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>an electronic or physical signature of the copyright owner or of the person
authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and</li>
	<li>a description identifying the material claimed to have been infringed and that
is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and the location where
the original or an authorized copy of the material exists (for example, the URL
of the page of the website where it is lawfully posted; the name, edition and
pages of a book from which an excerpt was copied, etc.); and</li>
	<li>information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact
you, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an electronic
mail; and</li>
	<li>a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material, in the
manner complained of, is not authorized by its rightful owner, its agent, or the
law; and</li>
	<li>a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under
penalty of perjury, that you are the rightful copyright owner or that you are
authorized to act on behalf of the owner’s behalf.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph">You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this section, your
take down request may not be valid. Please note that we regularly provide your name, contact
information, as well as the contents of your takedown request to the person who posted the
content you are reporting. In the case that you are an authorized representative submitting a
report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question.</ul>

<p class="title">The Counter-Notification Process</p>

<p class="paragraph">When a user’s video submission has been removed, the Website shall notify the user of this
removal, including by providing the contact information of the person or entity sending the
takedown request.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Pursuant to the Website’s repeat infringer policy, the user then has five (5) days to submit
a counter-notification to the Website, explaining why the original takedown notice was sent
in error. The counter-notification may be sent to the Xvideos email address from which the
user originally received the forwarded takedown request (c******@xvideos.com).</p>

<p class="paragraph">For the Website to consider a user’s counter-notification, it must include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A physical or electronic signature of the user; and</li>
	<li>Identification of the material that has been removed by providing one or
more URLs where the material was previously available; and</li>
	<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good-faith belief that
the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>
	<li>The user's name, address, and telephone number; and.</li>
	<li>A statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of the federal District
Court for the judicial district in which the user is located, or if the user’s
address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the
Website may be found; and</li>
	<li>A statement that the user will accept service of process from the person who
sent the notice of alleged infringement or an agent of such person.</li>
</ul>

<p class="paragraph">Counter-notifications that do not satisfy all of these elements are ineffective and may not be
considered by the Website.</p>

<p class="paragraph">Please note that we will send any complete counter-notifications we receive to the person
who submitted the original takedown request. That person may elect to file a lawsuit against
you for copyright infringement. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed
within ten (10) business days after we provide notice of your counter-notification, we will
restore access to the removed materials. Until that time, your uploaded material will remain
inaccessible. We will provide a copy of the original takedown request if asked.</p>

<p class="paragraph">D. You understand that when using the Website, you will be exposed to user Submissions
from a wide variety of sources, and that Xvideos is not responsible for the accuracy,
usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such Submissions. You
further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to user Submissions that are
inaccurate, indecent, offensive, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do
waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Xvideos with
respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold Xvideos and its owners, affiliates, and/or
licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your
use of the Website.</p>

<p class="subtitle" id="section8">8. VENUE AND JURISDICTION, CHOICE OF LAW, ARBITRATION</p>

<p class="paragraph">8.1 You agree that the Terms of Service, your use of the Website, as well as any claim relating
to, arising out of, or in connection with the Terms of Service and your use of the
Website, shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic without regard to conflict of
law provisions.</p>

<p class="paragraph">8.2 You further agree that you shall endeavor to resolve any and all claims relating to, arising
out of, or in connection with the Terms of Service or your use of the Website by engaging in
amicable consultations with WGCZ for no less than thirty (30) calendar days. Those
amicable consultations shall commence upon WGCZ’s receipt of a notice of dispute
containing sufficient information to identify you and the basis of your claim. The notice of
dispute must be sent by registered mail to WGCZ, a.s., Krakovska 1366/25, 110 00 Prague, Czech
Republic.</p>

<p class="paragraph">8.3 If the dispute cannot be resolved by amicable consultations under section 8.2, it shall be
submitted by either party to the Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of
Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic (“Arbitration Court”),
except for disputes in which the Czech state courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Czech
law.</p>

<p class="paragraph">8.4 Arbitral disputes under Section 8.3 shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators in

on the parties.</p>

you and Xvideos. If any provision of these terms of service is deemed invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions of these terms of service, which shall remain in full force and effect.
No waiver of any term of these terms of service shall be deemed a further or continuing
waiver of such term or any other term, and Xvideos’ failure to assert any right or provision
under these terms of service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p class="paragraph">We reserve the right to amend these terms at any time and for any reason, without advance
notice to you. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these
Terms of Service, you are advised to periodically review the most up-to-date version of these
terms on this page, so that you are aware of any changes. Once we make the new terms
available, these changes become effective immediately and if you use the Website after they

foreign language versions.</p>
