Smith. \nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nAs far as the hoax goes, users are warned about an incoming friend request from a user named \"Jayden K. Smith,\" who is reportedly a hacker. Then the user is encouraged to share the warning with all of their friends to protect one's Facebook network from Jayden.\nThe warning looks a little something like this:\nPlease tell all the contacts in your Messenger list, not to accept Jayden K Smith friendship request. He is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received.\nThe thing is: the message itself is the hoax. Which we should have all realized if we just stopped and thought about it for a second.\nFirst, \"the system connected to your Facebook account.\" Lol. Gonna need more info there. \nSecond, it's silly to think you'll be hacked if any of your Facebook friends becomes friends with Jayden. Becoming friends with someone on Facebook doesn't somehow provide a person access to, say, your email password. \nThis viral message isn't smart, but it seems to be designed to take advantage of a critical nexus of (the lack of) hacking knowledge: Many people don't know how hacking works and many people are also understandably afraid of being hacked. \nHey, at least we get the memes, I guess. \nTrump announces new head of World Cyber Security Task Force: Jayden K.

Already with a bit of leverage over the summit thanks to being its host, Merkel highlights the one alliance that a lot of the world fears, and guarantees that everyone sees the warm embrace.\nIt's not a troll so much as a subtle show of force, directed at a man who puts far too much stock in such actions. \nWhether Trump sees it as a power play — or even cares — is beside the point; Merkel got one over on him, and Trump's stature in the world is probably worse for it.\nWATCH: Donald Trump vs. The Dictionary"},"shares":{"google_plus":5,"twitter":280,"linked_in":4,"facebook":1153,"total":1442},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ampgFJ6WnxzxUlPtzkSz7K2Lhfg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529121%2F1244cb3d-1fd8-4f13-b998-e8e5309b3f5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xIkXdW7_yynGZK7UODPN5qRjrzA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-efZjO3hQzENwQMktMr5ibPOgRU=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NA5adaB8QkYY8ZkM4-Hye9Mh4pA=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tUiGI7","display_title":"Angela Merkel made damn sure we saw that Putin-Trump handshake","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"EmljNGOlL6","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Subtle, Merkel.

The social networking giant announced plans this week to turn part of its Menlo Park, California property into a \"mixed-use village\" that'll be like its own town. \nThe property at Facebook's corporate headquarters will contain a grocery store, a pharmacy, housing, office space, and other services that people usually access in their own, non-Zuckerberg-controlled towns.  \n\"Part of our vision is to create a neighborhood center that provides long-needed community services,\" said a post on the Facebook Community page. \n\nFacebook intends to file its plan with Menlo Park this month. The company expects the review process to last two years, and for construction to follow in phases. The first set of stores, housing, and office space could be completed in 2021. \nIn part, this ambitious plan is meant to combat housing crisis in and around San Francisco, where supply is low and prices are sky-high. Facebook's campus will contain 1,500 housing units, and 15 percent of those will be available at below-market rates, the company said. \nThe housing is then meant to spur development in transportation. Population density at Facebook would \"support new east-west connections and a future transit center,\" Facebook said. \nThe company is calling this project Willow Campus.

Analysts believe the company may be nearing the point where it will start to really feel the squeeze of those constraints.\nThis isn't the first style of ad Facebook has attempted within Messenger. The company launched an ad format last fall that allowed brands to insert conversational prompts into existing chats with users.

There's not a Starbucks or Soul Cycle on every corner, and broadband internet access isn't always a given. \nMicrosoft is the latest tech company trying to make \"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of rural broadband\" its new motto. The company's new Rural Airband Initiative is aimed at filling the gap of underserved rural Americans with affordable high-speed internet. Facebook, Google, and Amazon have all jumped into the area of providing some form of internet service, and now we can finally add Microsoft to the list.\nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nThe lofty goal is to help bring broadband access to the 23.4 million rural Americans currently living without high-speed internet by July 4, 2020. It's an aggressive target, but at least somewhat admirable.\nMicrosoft set some clear guidelines for reaching this huge number of people. It will rely not only on money from private capital investments, but also on support from the public sector. This means input from the government. \nMicrosoft first needs the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) to provide three sub-700 MHz channels across the country, so it can use those frequencies for broadband internet. It also wants state and federal infrastructure investments to match funds for expanding coverage into places that have some broadband already, and also wants to reach into completely new rural areas. Finally, Microsoft wants the FCC to provide more data about the current state of broadband coverage in rural areas. \n\"Broadband connectivity is no longer simply a luxury for streaming YouTube videos on a tablet. It has become a critical connection to a better education and living.\"\nThe initiative is very much focused around TV white spaces, or the unused broadcasting frequencies in the wireless spectrum of UHV television bands. The bandwidth is around 600 MHz, and it can travel over hills and through buildings and trees. Television networks use it as a buffering space between channels, but some people want to use it for broadband internet.\nIt will be used to hit areas with only two to 200 people living in each square mile. In areas with less than two people per square mile, satellite coverage will be used, and areas with over 200 people in this range will rely on fixed wireless and limited fiber connections. \nBrad Smith, Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer, explained the use of all three methods in a blog post.\n\"By relying on this mixture of technologies, the total capital and initial operating cost to eliminate the rural broadband gap falls into a range of $8 to $12 billion,\" Smith said. \"This is roughly 80 percent less than the cost of using fiber cables alone, and it’s over 50 percent cheaper than the cost of current fixed wireless technology like 4G.\"\nHe noted one huge factor why this whole initiative is being put into place at all: Rural communities are at a big disadvantage compared to their urban counterparts when it comes to economic and educational opportunities. \n\nThe new plan will rollout in 12 states over the next 12 months. This will only benefit 2 million of the 23 million Americans still without broadband access, but it's definitely a start. Microsoft plans to partner with telecommunications companies to get the job done faster, too.\nOnce rural communities are set up with their broadband, Microsoft claims it will invest in digital skills training through Microsoft Philanthropies. People will learn how to use their new technology to improve education, health care, agriculture, and their own businesses.\nMicrosoft is also launching a new program to share what they've learned through this process with other technology companies. This means royalty-free access to at least 39 patents and access to sample source code for the technology used to bring broadband through TV white spaces to rural communities.\nThis is all great, and rural communities will see huge benefits if this all works out. But don't forget that Microsoft (and other technology companies) will benefitting from this initiative, too. \nMore people with access to the internet means more people that are paying for internet services, some of which could very well add to the wealth of Microsoft itself. There's nothing like buying a new Microsoft Lumina phone to play on the internet provided to you by Microsoft. \nBut, no matter how Microsoft is benefitting from the deal, there's still a lot of good behind it. People living in rural communities might finally have access to the web like those of us in urban areas have had for quite some time. Whether this means better education, a boost in the economy, or more people choosing to stay in their hometowns because they finally have internet equality, it's a good deal all around. So if you live in a rural area of the United States, you can look forward to being a part of the internet searching masses by 2020.\nWATCH: 7 more things you didn't know about 'Planet of the Apes'"},"shares":{"facebook":74,"twitter":324,"linked_in":11,"google_plus":4,"total":413},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/K7bpie-iPTBF-pIdRwoTQhiH4Wg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F532463%2F939b26cd-34b9-41d0-b166-f8bf3f43cc76.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q02muPU4wlFp8hclBL9P6LjokDU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ClsnUk9huDt4ODJk8OkVDa3Oup8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E-6ZGPSkOfgEwmS7aZgjU4ieI8U=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HmTJdVjE9T4BcnkN-u1ttzDylo0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d0O4AQzeCLGX9yG_QXUD23x7Sd4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2t1nP1R","display_title":"Microsoft commits to bringing broadband internet to rural America","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG5RzoNv","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Internet for all.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Microsoft commits to bringing broadband internet to rural America"},{"_id":"59644aaef11b2c012e0000be","id":"2017/07/10/newspapers-congress-antitrust-pass","title":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-07-10T20:48:31-07:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 20:48:31 -0700","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"535","sort_key":"1DuMU3","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/newspapers-congress-antitrust-pass/","content":{"plain":"Newspapers have long considered Facebook and Google their frenemies.\nOn the one hand, they rely on both to distribute their words and ads to a mass audience as print ads and subscription dollars plummet.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook and Google are destroying bad online ads, which is great until they own the world\nBut by doing so, the two tech giants have now ballooned in size to the point where there's little room left for anyone else in the industry to breathe.\nFacebook and Google now collectively control around $.70 of every dollar spent on digital ads. The portion of three remaining dimes that isn't vacuumed up by other platforms like Twitter, Snapchat or Verizon-AOL-Yahoo! or any number of ad tech middleman is split between hundreds of media outlets each competing for a sliver of a cent.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power when it comes to working with these platforms. Facebook and Google do ultimately need the media and the content they produce to fuel their platforms. But when the two titans are the only two information distribution channels of any significance in town, they can easily pit news outlets against one another to get the best deal for themselves.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power ...\nThat prisoner's dilemma pushed news publishers to do something unusual this week. Behind the banner of the News Media Alliance -- a trade group that encompasses more than 2,000 newspapers, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post -- they are asking Congress for permission to act as a team in negotiations with the two platforms.\nWithout a specific pass from the government, the coordination could run afoul of antitrust laws, which are meant to prevent monopolies and maintain competitive markets. The request is therefore a bit ironic, considering that its goal is to confront existing duopoly powers.\nThe bid could be a long shot in a Republican-controlled Congress under an administration that's not exactly on good terms with the country's news media.\nBut the news industry is getting desperate. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern said the threat posed by Google and Facebook dwarfed that of the president's relentless efforts to delegitimize and undercut the press. \n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together,\" Chavern wrote. \"Antitrust laws are insulating Google and Facebook from market forces.\"\nThe newspapers aren't the first to recognize the need to make peace with competitors in the face of Silicon Valley might. Ad-sharing agreements and controlled exchanges to buy and sell them have been increasingly common among media companies. Three of the biggest ad tech firms forged an unprecedented alliance to pool their data earlier this year.\nAnd even the heads of the world's biggest advertisers are calling for a unified front as they face down the two heavyweights on a laundry list of grievances, including transparency in how their ads are measured, where on the web they are placed, and how fraud is kept to a minimum.\n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together\"\n\"The days of giving digital a pass are over,\" Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer of Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, said in a call to arms at an Association of National Advertisers meeting in January. \"It's time to grow up. It's time for action.\"   \nAccording to Chavern's op-ed, the group was emboldened by a landmark antitrust ruling in the European Union in which Google was fined more than $2.7 billion for \"abusing dominance\" in the search market. European regulators are often seen as a bellwether of approaches that might eventually cross the Atlantic.\nBut there are definite risks if the government won't grant the group antitrust exemption. A handful of print publishers butted heads with antitrust regulators when they tried to form a similar arrangement to work with Apple on an ebook competitor a few years ago. \nFor their part, Facebook and Google have paid lip service to the need to incentivize quality journalism and granted publishers some minor concessions.

Smith. \nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nAs far as the hoax goes, users are warned about an incoming friend request from a user named \"Jayden K. Smith,\" who is reportedly a hacker. Then the user is encouraged to share the warning with all of their friends to protect one's Facebook network from Jayden.\nThe warning looks a little something like this:\nPlease tell all the contacts in your Messenger list, not to accept Jayden K Smith friendship request. He is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received.\nThe thing is: the message itself is the hoax. Which we should have all realized if we just stopped and thought about it for a second.\nFirst, \"the system connected to your Facebook account.\" Lol. Gonna need more info there. \nSecond, it's silly to think you'll be hacked if any of your Facebook friends becomes friends with Jayden. Becoming friends with someone on Facebook doesn't somehow provide a person access to, say, your email password. \nThis viral message isn't smart, but it seems to be designed to take advantage of a critical nexus of (the lack of) hacking knowledge: Many people don't know how hacking works and many people are also understandably afraid of being hacked. \nHey, at least we get the memes, I guess. \nTrump announces new head of World Cyber Security Task Force: Jayden K.

The company expects the review process to last two years, and for construction to follow in phases. The first set of stores, housing, and office space could be completed in 2021. \nIn part, this ambitious plan is meant to combat housing crisis in and around San Francisco, where supply is low and prices are sky-high. Facebook's campus will contain 1,500 housing units, and 15 percent of those will be available at below-market rates, the company said. \nThe housing is then meant to spur development in transportation. Population density at Facebook would \"support new east-west connections and a future transit center,\" Facebook said. \nThe company is calling this project Willow Campus.

Already with a bit of leverage over the summit thanks to being its host, Merkel highlights the one alliance that a lot of the world fears, and guarantees that everyone sees the warm embrace.\nIt's not a troll so much as a subtle show of force, directed at a man who puts far too much stock in such actions. \nWhether Trump sees it as a power play — or even cares — is beside the point; Merkel got one over on him, and Trump's stature in the world is probably worse for it.\nWATCH: Donald Trump vs. The Dictionary"},"shares":{"google_plus":5,"twitter":280,"linked_in":4,"facebook":1153,"total":1442},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ampgFJ6WnxzxUlPtzkSz7K2Lhfg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529121%2F1244cb3d-1fd8-4f13-b998-e8e5309b3f5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xIkXdW7_yynGZK7UODPN5qRjrzA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yhcEYeLUexjnhTR2xLdiOw2T3Xc=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9WYVFdO-V4IVBUGB629E8mxy-dI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AtRDG_ReKd_qHBd-E-HQymDZfcE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n0lLyeufuW3xPFuGhr54Eg54iFQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tUiGI7","display_title":"Angela Merkel made damn sure we saw that Putin-Trump handshake","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"EmljNGOlL6","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Subtle, Merkel.

Calling one of the features on its site a \"smart address book,\" PlanetAll allowed users to connect with other groups around particular interests, offered news updates, horoscopes, and offered a calendar reminder service that worked with the then popular Palm Pilot mobile organizer.\nHowever, the move wasn't an example of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos somehow having the foresight to make Amazon a social network before Mark Zuckerberg. Instead, Amazon's acquisition was primarily designed to help Amazon get its books to more people. \n\n\"Portals are a great business to be in, but it just doesn't happen to be our business,\" said Bezos following the announcement of the acquisition. \"Amazon is and has always been focused on being an ecommerce destination, and that will remain the focus.\"\nBut as the Timeline profile on PlanetAll notes, Bezos and his team later realized its mistake and filed a patent application in 2008 for a 'social networking system,' but by then it was too late, a social networking gold rush was already in effect.   \n\"Portals are a great business to be in, but it just doesn't happen to be our business.\"\nAs for the title of \"first social network,\" that title belongs to GeoCities, which arrived around a year before PlanetAll and was eventually acquired by Yahoo. You see a trend here? The early players in social media that sold out too quickly soon disappeared under a fog of parent company mechanics, a fate Facebook managed to successfully avoid to become the world's biggest social network. \nRemember this the next time you think back to why Snapchat repeatedly turned down multi-billion dollar acquisition offers in just the last few years from Facebook. \nBut despite Bezos' apparent miss, he may ultimately have the last laugh. From the ubiquitous Amazon Prime, to the Kindle and internet appliance Amazon Show, to its growing reach in brick and mortar retail via Whole Foods, it's beginning to look like we'll all be using Amazon soon, in one way or another. \nWATCH: Willy Wonka's sideways-moving elevator could soon become a reality"},"shares":{"twitter":496,"facebook":180,"linked_in":27,"google_plus":14,"pinterest":2,"total":719},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VAEv-KklEg7xGxsOpNiT17TMZO8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525260%2F8b4853dc-e0a0-4933-96a4-b979df4bd8ac.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jo3qzS4o3fQdSFRytkHYJDkkLhk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HT3jTXDe4aAWRui39GdQ0x4zNTU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8Lwyk12QyI8TITgaqoYfWLsf_mA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/89BNhPnPB2h-ddD10PN2FLl_IL8=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nv6ZWDYazF-NrKIxGmLT4aJyuKw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uvtKsn","display_title":"That time Amazon had a social network years before Facebook","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOBPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Back when social networking was something many considered just another internet gamble not worth taking.

Smith. \nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nAs far as the hoax goes, users are warned about an incoming friend request from a user named \"Jayden K. Smith,\" who is reportedly a hacker. Then the user is encouraged to share the warning with all of their friends to protect one's Facebook network from Jayden.\nThe warning looks a little something like this:\nPlease tell all the contacts in your Messenger list, not to accept Jayden K Smith friendship request. He is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received.\nThe thing is: the message itself is the hoax. Which we should have all realized if we just stopped and thought about it for a second.\nFirst, \"the system connected to your Facebook account.\" Lol. Gonna need more info there. \nSecond, it's silly to think you'll be hacked if any of your Facebook friends becomes friends with Jayden. Becoming friends with someone on Facebook doesn't somehow provide a person access to, say, your email password. \nThis viral message isn't smart, but it seems to be designed to take advantage of a critical nexus of (the lack of) hacking knowledge: Many people don't know how hacking works and many people are also understandably afraid of being hacked. \nHey, at least we get the memes, I guess. \nTrump announces new head of World Cyber Security Task Force: Jayden K.

Already with a bit of leverage over the summit thanks to being its host, Merkel highlights the one alliance that a lot of the world fears, and guarantees that everyone sees the warm embrace.\nIt's not a troll so much as a subtle show of force, directed at a man who puts far too much stock in such actions. \nWhether Trump sees it as a power play — or even cares — is beside the point; Merkel got one over on him, and Trump's stature in the world is probably worse for it.\nWATCH: Donald Trump vs. The Dictionary"},"shares":{"google_plus":5,"twitter":280,"linked_in":4,"facebook":1153,"total":1442},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ampgFJ6WnxzxUlPtzkSz7K2Lhfg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529121%2F1244cb3d-1fd8-4f13-b998-e8e5309b3f5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xIkXdW7_yynGZK7UODPN5qRjrzA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yhcEYeLUexjnhTR2xLdiOw2T3Xc=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9WYVFdO-V4IVBUGB629E8mxy-dI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AtRDG_ReKd_qHBd-E-HQymDZfcE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n0lLyeufuW3xPFuGhr54Eg54iFQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tUiGI7","display_title":"Angela Merkel made damn sure we saw that Putin-Trump handshake","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"EmljNGOlL6","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Subtle, Merkel.

The social networking giant announced plans this week to turn part of its Menlo Park, California property into a \"mixed-use village\" that'll be like its own town. \nThe property at Facebook's corporate headquarters will contain a grocery store, a pharmacy, housing, office space, and other services that people usually access in their own, non-Zuckerberg-controlled towns.  \n\"Part of our vision is to create a neighborhood center that provides long-needed community services,\" said a post on the Facebook Community page. \n\nFacebook intends to file its plan with Menlo Park this month. The company expects the review process to last two years, and for construction to follow in phases. The first set of stores, housing, and office space could be completed in 2021. \nIn part, this ambitious plan is meant to combat housing crisis in and around San Francisco, where supply is low and prices are sky-high. Facebook's campus will contain 1,500 housing units, and 15 percent of those will be available at below-market rates, the company said. \nThe housing is then meant to spur development in transportation. Population density at Facebook would \"support new east-west connections and a future transit center,\" Facebook said. \nThe company is calling this project Willow Campus.

The portion of three remaining dimes that isn't vacuumed up by other platforms like Twitter, Snapchat or Verizon-AOL-Yahoo! or any number of ad tech middleman is split between hundreds of media outlets each competing for a sliver of a cent.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power when it comes to working with these platforms. Facebook and Google do ultimately need the media and the content they produce to fuel their platforms. But when the two titans are the only two information distribution channels of any significance in town, they can easily pit news outlets against one another to get the best deal for themselves.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power ...\nThat prisoner's dilemma pushed news publishers to do something unusual this week. Behind the banner of the News Media Alliance -- a trade group that encompasses more than 2,000 newspapers, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post -- they are asking Congress for permission to act as a team in negotiations with the two platforms.\nWithout a specific pass from the government, the coordination could run afoul of antitrust laws, which are meant to prevent monopolies and maintain competitive markets. The request is therefore a bit ironic, considering that its goal is to confront existing duopoly powers.\nThe bid could be a long shot in a Republican-controlled Congress under an administration that's not exactly on good terms with the country's news media.\nBut the news industry is getting desperate. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern said the threat posed by Google and Facebook dwarfed that of the president's relentless efforts to delegitimize and undercut the press. \n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together,\" Chavern wrote. \"Antitrust laws are insulating Google and Facebook from market forces.\"\nThe newspapers aren't the first to recognize the need to make peace with competitors in the face of Silicon Valley might. Ad-sharing agreements and controlled exchanges to buy and sell them have been increasingly common among media companies. Three of the biggest ad tech firms forged an unprecedented alliance to pool their data earlier this year.\nAnd even the heads of the world's biggest advertisers are calling for a unified front as they face down the two heavyweights on a laundry list of grievances, including transparency in how their ads are measured, where on the web they are placed, and how fraud is kept to a minimum.\n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together\"\n\"The days of giving digital a pass are over,\" Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer of Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, said in a call to arms at an Association of National Advertisers meeting in January. \"It's time to grow up. It's time for action.\"   \nAccording to Chavern's op-ed, the group was emboldened by a landmark antitrust ruling in the European Union in which Google was fined more than $2.7 billion for \"abusing dominance\" in the search market. European regulators are often seen as a bellwether of approaches that might eventually cross the Atlantic.\nBut there are definite risks if the government won't grant the group antitrust exemption. A handful of print publishers butted heads with antitrust regulators when they tried to form a similar arrangement to work with Apple on an ebook competitor a few years ago. \nFor their part, Facebook and Google have paid lip service to the need to incentivize quality journalism and granted publishers some minor concessions. An ad filter built into an upcoming version of Google Chrome, for instance, will include a way for readers to choose to pay publications directly instead of blocking their ads. There are also reports that Facebook is working towards a paid subscription model for its Instant Articles program.\n\"We’re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook. We’re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do,\" Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said in a statement on Monday.\nGoogle echoed the sentiment.\n“We remain deeply committed to helping publishers with both their challenges, and their opportunities,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\nPublishers are now ready to test that commitment.\nWATCH: Google Glass for autistic kids \n\n  "},"shares":{"facebook":71,"twitter":376,"google_plus":11,"linked_in":77,"total":535},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8aORZ1HPaG33HH47g-eUElJC_os=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531748%2Fc69af0d5-b164-4967-b708-d893301223ae.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qbHaZRa3rF_hgL9_NyD-wDLK0u8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/L3q09SBVA6Tzo_TnTJsJIwORVm4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VZ_DXbofa071yWpwp0NRPkJY3Wo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mF60voS_2HFgBWfJe7a82cPkODQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FFz2m-BH7DKwHUeJSf-Ea05-lCk=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sYHGyL","display_title":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"qeGlvzylkX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Newspapers are seeking a pass from Congress to team up.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google"},{"_id":"59638e77f11b2c073d000c19","id":"2017/07/10/snacphat-net-neutrality-day-july-12-facebook-google","title":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2017-07-10T07:25:58-07:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 07:25:58 -0700","formatted_date":"07/10/2017","formatted_shares":"443","sort_key":"1DuApU","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/snacphat-net-neutrality-day-july-12-facebook-google/","content":{"plain":"A free and open internet is at stake, and the tech giants aren't letting it go without a fight.\nSnap Inc., the parent of Snapchat, is just the latest tech company to throw its public support behind the open internet in a statement sent to Mashable. \nSEE ALSO: Light up the John Oliver signal: The battle over Net Neutrality is back\nThe company also confirmed its participation in Net Neutrality Day through the Internet Association, a trade group that represents many of the tech giants on issues related to the internet.

There's not a Starbucks or Soul Cycle on every corner, and broadband internet access isn't always a given. \nMicrosoft is the latest tech company trying to make \"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of rural broadband\" its new motto. The company's new Rural Airband Initiative is aimed at filling the gap of underserved rural Americans with affordable high-speed internet. Facebook, Google, and Amazon have all jumped into the area of providing some form of internet service, and now we can finally add Microsoft to the list.\nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nThe lofty goal is to help bring broadband access to the 23.4 million rural Americans currently living without high-speed internet by July 4, 2020. It's an aggressive target, but at least somewhat admirable.\nMicrosoft set some clear guidelines for reaching this huge number of people. It will rely not only on money from private capital investments, but also on support from the public sector. This means input from the government. \nMicrosoft first needs the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) to provide three sub-700 MHz channels across the country, so it can use those frequencies for broadband internet. It also wants state and federal infrastructure investments to match funds for expanding coverage into places that have some broadband already, and also wants to reach into completely new rural areas. Finally, Microsoft wants the FCC to provide more data about the current state of broadband coverage in rural areas. \n\"Broadband connectivity is no longer simply a luxury for streaming YouTube videos on a tablet. It has become a critical connection to a better education and living.\"\nThe initiative is very much focused around TV white spaces, or the unused broadcasting frequencies in the wireless spectrum of UHV television bands. The bandwidth is around 600 MHz, and it can travel over hills and through buildings and trees. Television networks use it as a buffering space between channels, but some people want to use it for broadband internet.\nIt will be used to hit areas with only two to 200 people living in each square mile. In areas with less than two people per square mile, satellite coverage will be used, and areas with over 200 people in this range will rely on fixed wireless and limited fiber connections. \nBrad Smith, Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer, explained the use of all three methods in a blog post.\n\"By relying on this mixture of technologies, the total capital and initial operating cost to eliminate the rural broadband gap falls into a range of $8 to $12 billion,\" Smith said. \"This is roughly 80 percent less than the cost of using fiber cables alone, and it’s over 50 percent cheaper than the cost of current fixed wireless technology like 4G.\"\nHe noted one huge factor why this whole initiative is being put into place at all: Rural communities are at a big disadvantage compared to their urban counterparts when it comes to economic and educational opportunities. \n\nThe new plan will rollout in 12 states over the next 12 months. This will only benefit 2 million of the 23 million Americans still without broadband access, but it's definitely a start. Microsoft plans to partner with telecommunications companies to get the job done faster, too.\nOnce rural communities are set up with their broadband, Microsoft claims it will invest in digital skills training through Microsoft Philanthropies. People will learn how to use their new technology to improve education, health care, agriculture, and their own businesses.\nMicrosoft is also launching a new program to share what they've learned through this process with other technology companies. This means royalty-free access to at least 39 patents and access to sample source code for the technology used to bring broadband through TV white spaces to rural communities.\nThis is all great, and rural communities will see huge benefits if this all works out. But don't forget that Microsoft (and other technology companies) will benefitting from this initiative, too. \nMore people with access to the internet means more people that are paying for internet services, some of which could very well add to the wealth of Microsoft itself. There's nothing like buying a new Microsoft Lumina phone to play on the internet provided to you by Microsoft. \nBut, no matter how Microsoft is benefitting from the deal, there's still a lot of good behind it. People living in rural communities might finally have access to the web like those of us in urban areas have had for quite some time. Whether this means better education, a boost in the economy, or more people choosing to stay in their hometowns because they finally have internet equality, it's a good deal all around. So if you live in a rural area of the United States, you can look forward to being a part of the internet searching masses by 2020.\nWATCH: 7 more things you didn't know about 'Planet of the Apes'"},"shares":{"facebook":74,"twitter":324,"linked_in":11,"google_plus":4,"total":413},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/K7bpie-iPTBF-pIdRwoTQhiH4Wg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F532463%2F939b26cd-34b9-41d0-b166-f8bf3f43cc76.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q02muPU4wlFp8hclBL9P6LjokDU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ClsnUk9huDt4ODJk8OkVDa3Oup8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E-6ZGPSkOfgEwmS7aZgjU4ieI8U=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HmTJdVjE9T4BcnkN-u1ttzDylo0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d0O4AQzeCLGX9yG_QXUD23x7Sd4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51042%2Fd8d25610-9bae-43dc-968d-2fd21f823f50.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2t1nP1R","display_title":"Microsoft commits to bringing broadband internet to rural America","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG5RzoNv","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Internet for all.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Microsoft commits to bringing broadband internet to rural America"},{"_id":"596547acf11b2c08d4000249","id":"2017/07/11/facebook-messenger-ads-expansion","title":"Brace yourself: More ads are coming to Facebook Messenger","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-07-11T14:48:27-07:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 14:48:27 -0700","formatted_date":" 16 hours ago","formatted_shares":"348","sort_key":"1Dv3qc","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/facebook-messenger-ads-expansion/","content":{"plain":"Get ready to see more ads popping up in Facebook Messenger.\nAn exec at the social network said Tuesday that it plans to roll out ads to the Messenger home screen worldwide by the end of the year after testing them in Australia and Thailand earlier this year, Venture Beat reports.\nSEE ALSO: Some Facebook users will start seeing ads in an unexpected place\nThe company plans to gradually wean them in as to avoid annoying users with a flood of new ads.\n“We’ll start slow,” Facebook's head of product for Messenger, Stan Chudnovsky, said at a conference in San Francisco this week. “When the average user can be sure to see them we truly don’t know because we’re just going to be very data-driven and user feedback-driven on making that decision.”\n\nA single ad will appear about halfway down the central hub of the Messenger app, a slight change from the carousel-style format the company had previously tested.

Smith. \nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nAs far as the hoax goes, users are warned about an incoming friend request from a user named \"Jayden K. Smith,\" who is reportedly a hacker. Then the user is encouraged to share the warning with all of their friends to protect one's Facebook network from Jayden.\nThe warning looks a little something like this:\nPlease tell all the contacts in your Messenger list, not to accept Jayden K Smith friendship request. He is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received.\nThe thing is: the message itself is the hoax. Which we should have all realized if we just stopped and thought about it for a second.\nFirst, \"the system connected to your Facebook account.\" Lol. Gonna need more info there. \nSecond, it's silly to think you'll be hacked if any of your Facebook friends becomes friends with Jayden. Becoming friends with someone on Facebook doesn't somehow provide a person access to, say, your email password. \nThis viral message isn't smart, but it seems to be designed to take advantage of a critical nexus of (the lack of) hacking knowledge: Many people don't know how hacking works and many people are also understandably afraid of being hacked. \nHey, at least we get the memes, I guess. \nTrump announces new head of World Cyber Security Task Force: Jayden K.

Participants will advocate for people to contact Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to show their support for net neutrality. \n\"Without a free and open Internet, Snapchat would not be what it is today. We strongly believe in affording future innovators the same opportunities,\" a Snapchat spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \n\"That is why we are committed to supporting creativity, free expression, and a level playing field for all. It is essential that we maintain an Internet that rewards innovation, allows new businesses the opportunity to succeed, and grows our economy,\" it continued. \nSnap's participation announcement comes weeks after some of its peers in the industry, drawing criticism from outspoken advocates for net neutrality: \nBravo, @Snap. Welcome to the open web. Pro tip: you may also want to defend #netneutrality before you get squeezed. https://t.co/hTaNlrGx9a— Jason Kint (@jason_kint) July 6, 2017\n\nBut Snapchat hasn't been silent on the importance of net neutrality for its business. As it noted in its S1, the papers it filed to go public, \"the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity, or use of the internet, including laws governing internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our products and increase our cost of doing business.\"\nFight for the Future, an organization behind Net Neutrality Day, says nearly 70,000 people, organizations, online forums, startups, and other groups are participating in the event on Wednesday. The web platforms include Airbnb, Dropbox, Spotify, Google, Facebook, and now Snap Inc. \n\nWATCH: Aerial footage shows Chernobyl 30 years after the world’s worst nuclear disaster"},"shares":{"facebook":83,"twitter":292,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":60,"total":443},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ylSizOpAavT7Q9Gf1v4Vwwh0ozg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530822%2F222dbbab-67d4-4e1a-89e4-bde8388c9749.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JFBZ9skNPf9f824e-__FgRNQm2s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aFl8xRenl7pWCAxfSFkyhsPsol4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n9Tgd4pNy_PGNBhLhQLfyxHB0Ho=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IGbwfbBwFqrSftp6aP_Zq7Z8U9k=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zgRTaTQn1Ve2_yATh0g1jav3XjA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tGknqr","display_title":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"MboWbOzl8e","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The day of action is on July 12.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon"},{"_id":"59615266f11b2c2a2a001b6a","id":"2017/07/08/facebook-willow-campus-town","title":"Facebook plans to build its own IRL town with homes, offices, and a grocery store","title_tag":null,"author":"Emma Hinchliffe","post_date":"2017-07-08T14:45:08-07:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 08 Jul 2017 14:45:08 -0700","formatted_date":"07/08/2017","formatted_shares":"1.3k","sort_key":"1DtYaM","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/08/facebook-willow-campus-town/","content":{"plain":"Facebook isn't content with just governing everything you do online. The social networking giant announced plans this week to turn part of its Menlo Park, California property into a \"mixed-use village\" that'll be like its own town. \nThe property at Facebook's corporate headquarters will contain a grocery store, a pharmacy, housing, office space, and other services that people usually access in their own, non-Zuckerberg-controlled towns.  \n\"Part of our vision is to create a neighborhood center that provides long-needed community services,\" said a post on the Facebook Community page. \n\nFacebook intends to file its plan with Menlo Park this month. The company expects the review process to last two years, and for construction to follow in phases. The first set of stores, housing, and office space could be completed in 2021. \nIn part, this ambitious plan is meant to combat housing crisis in and around San Francisco, where supply is low and prices are sky-high. Facebook's campus will contain 1,500 housing units, and 15 percent of those will be available at below-market rates, the company said. \nThe housing is then meant to spur development in transportation. Population density at Facebook would \"support new east-west connections and a future transit center,\" Facebook said. \nThe company is calling this project Willow Campus. It sounds like either the future, or a major blast to the coal mining towns of the past. \nFacebook is building employee housing near its headquarters.

Already with a bit of leverage over the summit thanks to being its host, Merkel highlights the one alliance that a lot of the world fears, and guarantees that everyone sees the warm embrace.\nIt's not a troll so much as a subtle show of force, directed at a man who puts far too much stock in such actions. \nWhether Trump sees it as a power play — or even cares — is beside the point; Merkel got one over on him, and Trump's stature in the world is probably worse for it.\nWATCH: Donald Trump vs. The Dictionary"},"shares":{"google_plus":5,"twitter":280,"linked_in":4,"facebook":1153,"total":1442},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ampgFJ6WnxzxUlPtzkSz7K2Lhfg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529121%2F1244cb3d-1fd8-4f13-b998-e8e5309b3f5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xIkXdW7_yynGZK7UODPN5qRjrzA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yhcEYeLUexjnhTR2xLdiOw2T3Xc=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9WYVFdO-V4IVBUGB629E8mxy-dI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AtRDG_ReKd_qHBd-E-HQymDZfcE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n0lLyeufuW3xPFuGhr54Eg54iFQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50766%2F7dee57f8-fd21-4d5c-a478-cdf581c4057b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tUiGI7","display_title":"Angela Merkel made damn sure we saw that Putin-Trump handshake","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"EmljNGOlL6","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Subtle, Merkel.

Calling one of the features on its site a \"smart address book,\" PlanetAll allowed users to connect with other groups around particular interests, offered news updates, horoscopes, and offered a calendar reminder service that worked with the then popular Palm Pilot mobile organizer.\nHowever, the move wasn't an example of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos somehow having the foresight to make Amazon a social network before Mark Zuckerberg. Instead, Amazon's acquisition was primarily designed to help Amazon get its books to more people. \n\n\"Portals are a great business to be in, but it just doesn't happen to be our business,\" said Bezos following the announcement of the acquisition. \"Amazon is and has always been focused on being an ecommerce destination, and that will remain the focus.\"\nBut as the Timeline profile on PlanetAll notes, Bezos and his team later realized its mistake and filed a patent application in 2008 for a 'social networking system,' but by then it was too late, a social networking gold rush was already in effect.   \n\"Portals are a great business to be in, but it just doesn't happen to be our business.\"\nAs for the title of \"first social network,\" that title belongs to GeoCities, which arrived around a year before PlanetAll and was eventually acquired by Yahoo. You see a trend here? The early players in social media that sold out too quickly soon disappeared under a fog of parent company mechanics, a fate Facebook managed to successfully avoid to become the world's biggest social network. \nRemember this the next time you think back to why Snapchat repeatedly turned down multi-billion dollar acquisition offers in just the last few years from Facebook. \nBut despite Bezos' apparent miss, he may ultimately have the last laugh. From the ubiquitous Amazon Prime, to the Kindle and internet appliance Amazon Show, to its growing reach in brick and mortar retail via Whole Foods, it's beginning to look like we'll all be using Amazon soon, in one way or another. \nWATCH: Willy Wonka's sideways-moving elevator could soon become a reality"},"shares":{"twitter":496,"facebook":180,"linked_in":27,"google_plus":14,"pinterest":2,"total":719},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VAEv-KklEg7xGxsOpNiT17TMZO8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525260%2F8b4853dc-e0a0-4933-96a4-b979df4bd8ac.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jo3qzS4o3fQdSFRytkHYJDkkLhk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HT3jTXDe4aAWRui39GdQ0x4zNTU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8Lwyk12QyI8TITgaqoYfWLsf_mA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/89BNhPnPB2h-ddD10PN2FLl_IL8=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nv6ZWDYazF-NrKIxGmLT4aJyuKw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uvtKsn","display_title":"That time Amazon had a social network years before Facebook","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOBPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Back when social networking was something many considered just another internet gamble not worth taking.

It also does nothing to address people who frequently share spammy clickbait, but at a frequency of less than 50 times a day (though Facebook has taken other steps to reduce the spread of fake news in its News Feed). \nWATCH: Relive your childhood with this vintage arcade game collection"},"shares":{"facebook":387,"google_plus":20,"twitter":670,"linked_in":103,"stumble_upon":789,"pinterest":3,"total":1972},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/W_KBdgZujWZBr0MFQP9jxrwbKc4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F524745%2Fe9e3299b-24c7-4570-b511-104bc312fc1e.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/szH4BDQw3qtdPhv_hQBxIoI_2qM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50338%2Fa9611542-7f5f-460f-9cd4-42ff4b6bfeea.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zv2bGNIa9f1Ye3z_PMqE-Gp0bxQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50338%2Fa9611542-7f5f-460f-9cd4-42ff4b6bfeea.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ii2wsQ3TmdsmpNaDfOHu-z6o4-A=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50338%2Fa9611542-7f5f-460f-9cd4-42ff4b6bfeea.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e3zX91Ok4CLpLuGn-dKmYg8UAMU=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50338%2Fa9611542-7f5f-460f-9cd4-42ff4b6bfeea.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4v2Ysp8kJc1C0J01SyF3i_8WPIc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50338%2Fa9611542-7f5f-460f-9cd4-42ff4b6bfeea.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2usLiVQ","display_title":"Facebook is targeting jerks who spam your News Feed","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Qml4ABVoqy","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Believe it or not, Facebook doesn't like spam either.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Facebook is targeting jerks who spam your News Feed"},{"_id":"5956896df11b2c1638000072","id":"2017/06/30/facebook-germany-hate-speech-fine-freedom-of-expression","title":"Facebook could now be fined $57m over hate speech","title_tag":null,"author":"Gianluca Mezzofiore","post_date":"2017-06-30T10:23:59-07:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 10:23:59 -0700","formatted_date":"06/30/2017","formatted_shares":"746","sort_key":"1Dr7DR","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/30/facebook-germany-hate-speech-fine-freedom-of-expression/","content":{"plain":"Facebook beware -- Germany is finally getting serious on fighting hate speech, and that has wider consequences.\nSEE ALSO: This country is waging a war against Facebook\nFor some time, the European country flagged the possibility it could impose a heavy fine on Facebook, Twitter and other social networks for allowing fake news and hate messages to proliferate. \nOn Friday, German lawmakers passed the Network Enforcement Act, commonly nicknamed as the \"Facebook law\", under which social media companies could face a fine of up to €50m (£43m; $57m) for failing to crack down on hate speech, criminal material and fake news. \nThe new law requires Facebook & co. to remove \"obviously illegal\" content within 24 hours after receiving notification or complaint. They also have to block other offensive content within seven days. The initial fine is up to €5m, which could rise to €50m. \nNew tools\nJustice Minister Heiko Maas, a strong supporter of the bill, said: “Freedom of expression ends where criminal law begins.\"\n“Experience has shown that, without political pressure, the large platform operators will not fulfill their obligations, and this law is therefore imperative,” he added in his address to the Bundestag. \nFacebook has recently announced new tools to fight the spread of fake news, including an option for users to flag fake news and third-party fact-checking with help from the Poynter International Fact Checking Network. \nThe company, which also added 3,000 people to the community operations team, said in a statement: \"We believe the best solutions will be found when government, civil society and industry work together and that this law as it stands now will not improve efforts to tackle this important societal problem.\n\"We feel that the lack of scrutiny and consultation do not do justice to the importance of the subject. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure safety for the people on our platform.\"\nThe hate speech legislation\nGermany has one of the world's toughest laws as far as hate speech is concerned. \nThe current legislation dates back to 1949, in an effort to curb any pro-Nazi excitement that would lead to a resurgence of fascism after World War II. \nSpecifically, one part of the German criminal code, per German outlet Deutsche Welle, says a person can be jailed for up to five years if that person: \n\"incites hatred against a national, racial, religious group or a group defined by their ethnic origins, against segments of the population or individuals because of their belonging to one of the aforementioned groups or segments of the population or calls for violent or arbitrary measures against them.\nRecently, the law has been used to battle hate speech against migrants.  \nFacebook, Twitter and Google agreed to remove such content from their networks within 24 hours, under the previous law. However, a 2017 report from the Justice Ministry found that companies were still falling short of committing completely to the law. \nAccording to the report, Facebook deleted just 39 percent of illegal hate speech within 24 hours in January and February. Earlier in June, German police raided the homes of 36 people over alleged hateful posts on social media. \nGeneral elections and wider context\nThe approval of this legislation is also in the context of the 2017 general election which is approaching fast in Germany. \nMaas underscored this in a post on Facebook, saying that any company that \"achieves billions in the net has a social responsibility.\" \n\"Parties should not manipulate political debates, they should refrain from social bots and fake news. The election campaign 2017 must not be a digital lie battle.\"\nBut there is also a wider context to Europe's apparent flexibility on the matter of internet censorship, most notably with its controversial \"right to be forgotten\" law that allows EU residents to request that stories about them containing information that is \"inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive\" to be removed from search results.\nGoogle has fought the ruling since it was approved in 2014 by an EU court and is also fighting the fact that a decision reached by France's highest court will apply globally, affecting all Google domains, not just search results in France. \nOnline censorship? \nIn both instances, European countries are exerting a certain level of censorship, even if under the auspices of curbing \"hate speech\" or \"irrelevant\" information, which has caused a backlash among advocacy groups. \nEDRi, a digital rights group, said in a blog post that the law could \"seriously impair human rights online\", including freedom of expression and opinion. \nThe group joined forces with other civil society associations and lobby group in arguing that the legislation could be incompatible with German constitutional law. \n\"These companies are, quite rationally, driven by the motivation to avoid liability, using the cheapest options available, and to exploit the political legitimisation of their restrictive measures for profit,\" Maryant Fernández Pérez, senior policy adviser at EDRi wrote. \n\"This can only lead to privatised, unpredictable online censorship.\"\nMarcus Gilmer contributed to this report. \nWATCH: This floating food forest is teaching kids about sustainability"},"shares":{"twitter":291,"facebook":343,"linked_in":103,"google_plus":8,"pinterest":1,"total":746},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HJ3MBR4jw7-lNXkufVEr49efd9o=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F524433%2Ff3af4d6e-ad0a-40e0-a56e-67d095179fa3.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xAFUDQHs6u3NjOPVRU-TJBHsQQs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50299%2Fd8c8037e-f6e3-44e4-b613-d3adcc452d18.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MpsCA2o5ENertB9xFm4j2kn4sgU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50299%2Fd8c8037e-f6e3-44e4-b613-d3adcc452d18.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/D4bFIfZxT00C2NPMWkvNvokpGJU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50299%2Fd8c8037e-f6e3-44e4-b613-d3adcc452d18.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZMJ4qW0Ze8mEQ9wRAlUNwvBuLW0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50299%2Fd8c8037e-f6e3-44e4-b613-d3adcc452d18.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6_A-1IQzWg70f-MeC9b-GbSD2gI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50299%2Fd8c8037e-f6e3-44e4-b613-d3adcc452d18.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2u79FZK","display_title":"Facebook could now be fined $57m over hate speech","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"BblyzpxoVY","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"There are wider implications over freedom of speech too.
