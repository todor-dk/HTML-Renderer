He <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2uapeCK\">released<\/a> the <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ua9hwg\">messages<\/a> on Twitter after the New York <em>Times<\/em> said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4854188\/donald-trump-jr-sean-hannity-natalia-veselnitskaya-meeting\/\">an interview<\/a> with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trump&#8217;s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4852691\/russian-lawyer-donald-trump-jr\/\">Natalia Veselnitskaya<\/a>, who denies having Kremlin ties.<\/p>\n<p>He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss Russian sanctions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For me, this was opposition research.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trump&#8217;s campaign colluded with the Kremlin.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The crown prosecutor of Russia &#8230; offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,&#8221; Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. on June 3. Russia does not have a &#8220;crown prosecutor&#8221; &#8211; the equivalent title is prosecutor general.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The conversation will now turn to whether President Trump was personally involved or not. But the question of the campaign\u2019s involvement appears settled now,&#8221; Cornell Law School professor Jens David Ohlin said in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The answer is yes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia.<\/p>\n<p>Trump Jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. He said he may have since had contact with other Russians.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve probably met with other people from Russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything,&#8221; he said on Fox News.<\/p>\n<h2>Financial markets jolted<\/h2>\n<p>The news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administration\u2019s economic agenda.<\/p>\n<p>Stocks and the dollar fell, while U.S. Treasury securities gained ground. Stocks later retraced most of their losses after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to keep lawmakers in Washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>Along with his younger brother Eric, Trump Jr. oversees the Trump Organization, his father&#8217;s real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the White House.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,&#8221; Trump said in a statement. The White House referred questions to lawyers for Trump and his son.<\/p>\n<p>The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities.<\/p>\n<p>He is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.<\/p>\n<p>The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a Senate source, while the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panel&#8217;s top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The American people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the Russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family,&#8221; Schiff told reporters.<\/p>\n<p>On Fox News, Trump Jr. said he was &#8220;more than happy to cooperate with everyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, asked the Trump administration how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the United States even though her authorization had expired.<\/p>\n<p>CNN reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, also planned to look into the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Vice President Mike Pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with Russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became Trump&#8217;s running mate later that summer.<\/p>\n<p>Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is at times harshly critical of Trump, told reporters: &#8220;This is very problematic. We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody&#8217;s campaign and say: &#8216;We&#8217;d like to help you.'&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 01:19:55","updated":"2017-07-12 01:19:55","minute":"1:19 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-emails-russia\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-emails-russia\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-emails-russia\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Trump Jr.'s Emails Show He Welcomed Russian Help","post_type":"post","hide_featured_image":"1","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/gettyimages-672046886.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"William Campbell\u2014Corbis\/Getty Images","caption":"Donald Trump Jr. speaks at a rally for Republican Greg Gianforte, April 22, 2017 in Bozeman, Montana.","attach_id":2089429},"excerpt":"\"I love it,\" he said of a Kremlin-backed offer of information on Hillary Clinton","authors":[{"id":"733096","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/reuters\/","name":"Reuters","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1713925\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/reuters-logo\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Reuters logo\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/reuters-logo.jpg?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":447824445,"name":"Leadership","slug":"leadership","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":46727,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice on leadership, management, jobs, careers, CEOs and anyone who aspires to the C-suite.","parent":0,"count":23908,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Leadership","slug":"leadership","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/leadership\/","newsletter_info":"Power Sheet"},"tags":[{"term_id":447810150,"name":"donald trump jr","slug":"donald-trump-jr","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":177093,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":12,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":447811327,"name":"OneTime","slug":"onetime","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":178270,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":4877,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":398,"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":56498,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":961,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":447824753,"name":"pubdesk","slug":"pubdesk","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":131635,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":13420,"filter":"raw"}],"has_commentary_tag":false,"primary_tag":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/politics\/"},"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"&#8220;I love it,&#8221;

Now that the prices of those blockchain-based currencies have <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/12\/ethereum-bitcoin-2017-all-time-high\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risen exponentially<\/a> in recent months, however, even BlackRock&#8217;s top economists are watching closely\u2014and with some concern.<\/p>\n<p>Asked by <em>Fortune<\/em> to address cryptocurrency at a press briefing Tuesday, Richard Turnill, BlackRock&#8217;s global chief investment strategist, waded into what he called &#8220;dangerous territory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I look at blockchain, I look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">charts<\/a>, and to me that looks pretty scary, and reminiscent of what we\u2019ve seen before,&#8221; he said, referring to the characteristics of previous market bubbles, such as the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that kind of nervousness that has helped deflate some of the recent crypto enthusiasm, which this year alone propelled the Bitcoin price up more than 200% to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/11\/bitcoin-breaks-3000-bull-run\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an all-time high of $3,000<\/a> in June, and Ethereum up more than 5,100% to a peak above $400. Just days after setting those records, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-coinbase-down\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crashed as much as 25%<\/a> in a single day, and have so far been unable to recover.<\/p>\n<p>The Ethereum price is currently under $190, down more than 50% from its high less than a month ago. Bitcoin now trades at about $2,280, 24% below its peak. (But even with the selloff, the cryptocurrencies have still delivered spectacular returns in 2017 to date: the Bitcoin price has more than doubled since the start of the year, while Ethereum is worth more than 23 times its value at the end of 2016.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071464\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_value\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776\" data-orig-size=\"1220,924\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_value\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows change in Bitcoin value since 2009&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2071464\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"776\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&amp;h=776 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=300&amp;h=227 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=768&amp;h=582 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart shows change in Bitcoin value since 2009<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, is far from the first to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/03\/bitcoin-ethereum-token-crypto-bubble\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">express alarm<\/a> over the rapid appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, which are estimated to exceed a combined $100 billion\u2014greater than the stock market value of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"gs\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">gs<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. In early June, Mark Cuban tweeted about cryptocurrency, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s in a bubble,&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/mark-cuban-twitter-bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompting the price of Bitcoin to swoon 5%<\/a>. Two weeks ago, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, who has 10% of his wealth invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/29\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-buy-michael-novogratz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said he&#8217;d been selling many of his coins<\/a>, suspecting that the digital currencies had already peaked for the year. Cryptocurrency, Novogratz further predicted, &#8220;is going to be the single greatest bubble of our lifetime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Goldman Sachs itself weighed in, <a href=\"http:\/\/and Goldman Sachs: http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/03\/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-price\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warning that Bitcoin could fall<\/a> another 19% from its current levels, to as low as $1,857.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if cryptocurrency really is in a bubble, it poses less of a danger to the rest of the market if it pops than other bubbles\u2014from housing to tech stocks\u2014have historically when they burst. After all, unlike stocks and bonds, which are intricately entwined with big banks and the world financial system, Bitcoin and Ethereum exist in almost a parallel universe to conventional assets, with only tenuous links to traditional Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the price went to zero tomorrow,&#8221;

one-fifth of young adults who stream shows like <em>Game of Thrones<\/em> or <em>Stranger Things<\/em> borrow passwords from people who do not live with them, according to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll, a finding that suggests media companies are missing out on significant revenue as digital viewership explodes.<\/p>\n<p>Twenty-one percent of streaming viewers ages 18 to 24 said they had accessed at least one digital video service such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix<\/a>, HBO Now or Hulu by using log-in credentials from someone outside their household at some time. Overall, 12% of adults <a href=\"http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/2sUQIYJ\">said they did the same thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Subscription revenue is likely to come under scrutiny starting next week when TV industry players begin reporting quarterly earnings. Netflix, the dominant streaming service, releases its results on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>Up to now, Netflix and other streaming networks have accepted some password-sharing, but they may face pressure from investors to change course if new sign-ups slow substantially, Wall Street analysts said. Revenue growth at Netflix is projected to drop from 31% in this year&#8217;s second quarter to 19% in the second quarter of next year, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If Netflix goes from a 30% revenue growth story to a 10% story, there is absolutely going to be more focus on their leaving money on the table,&#8221; said Justin <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/patterson\/\" target=\"_blank\">Patterson<\/a>, an analyst with Raymond James.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Respondents to the Reuters\/Ipsos survey said they borrow passwords to save money on video subscriptions, which can be cheap on their own but add up with multiple services.<\/p>\n<p>Donielle Bradshaw, a live-in nanny in Smyrna, Georgia, said she uses her 28-year-old sister\u2019s password for Hulu, and her 32-year-old brother\u2019s password for Netflix.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like since we are family, it\u2019s OK,&#8221; said the 22-year-old Bradshaw, who estimates she watches four hours of shows on weeknights and 10 hours a day on weekends.<\/p>\n<p>If companies cracked down on password sharing, Bradshaw said she would be willing to pay for her own Netflix subscription but is not sure about Hulu, which is owned by several media companies. &#8220;I binge a lot of shows on Netflix. I don\u2019t think I could do without it,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Companies say they accept some sharing as a way to promote their programming to potential customers, but they also take steps to curtail blatant freeloading.<\/p>\n<p>Many networks limit the number of people who can watch programming at the same time. Netflix, for example, allows two to four simultaneous streams per subscription, depending on the plan, and charges more for the higher number of streams.<\/p>\n<p>HBO, a unit of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/time-warner\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time Warner<\/a>, actually encourages younger viewers to use its HBO Now and HBO Go services for free by offering it to about 100 U.S. colleges and universities.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more about Netflix, watch<\/em>: <div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"4\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5393939030001-4\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5393939030001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uOPZdK\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Chulu%2Cnetflix%2Cnetflixcompetition%2Cstreamingservices%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dnetflix&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For us it\u2019s more important that at that age where they are not financially independent quite yet, they are habituating to using the product to ultimately aspiring to becoming paid customers,&#8221; Bernadette Aulestia, executive vice president of global distribution, said in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix executives also have said they know some viewers share passwords.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We could crack down on it, but you wouldn&#8217;t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,&#8221; Netflix chief financial officer David Wells said at a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> conference last September.<\/p>\n<h2>Missing a chance<\/h2>\n<p>Industry analysts say companies are missing a chance to grow revenue. An analysis by Parks Associates estimated streaming providers will lose $550 million in 2019 from password sharing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There has been this kind of cavalier attitude about it,&#8221; Parks Associates analyst Glenn Hower said. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been a priority.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Companies could crack down if they want. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cisco-systems\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco Systems<\/a>, for example, sells products that can detect abnormal activity on an account such as an unusual time or place, said Conrad Clemson, Cisco&#8217;s senior vice president and general manager of service provider platforms and applications.<\/p>\n<p>Cisco&#8217;s customers, which include streaming services and pay TV distributors, decide whether to use the information simply for monitoring or take additional steps such as sending a warning to account holders or shutting down an account, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of service providers and content providers are very much in the experimental phase right now,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Streaming providers say they do track account use but have provided few specifics.<\/p>\n<p>The Reuters\/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from June 8 to June 26. It gathered responses from 4,453 adults, including 3,557 people who said they streamed video from their cable TV provider or from standalone services like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> Prime, Hulu or Netflix.

Most notably, he served as New Jersey governor Chris Christie\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/1000642\/trumps-nominee-for-fbi-head-christopher-wray-was-chris-christies-personal-lawyer-during-bridgegate\/\">personal attorney<\/a> during the<a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-new-jersey-bridgegate-christie-idUSKCN11Y1L2\"> Bridgegate<\/a> investigation.<\/p>\n<p>The investigation into the possible Trump ties to Russia will be top of mind today, but there are other serious operational issues at hand Here are two questions I\u2019ll be listening for from the Committee members.<\/p>\n<p>1.) Where do you stand on torture?<\/p>\n<p>David Cole, the national legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/07\/11\/536515212\/fbi-director-nominee-christopher-wray-could-help-steady-the-bureau-amid-turmoil\">told NPR<\/a> that the senators should inquire about Wray\u2019s work after Sept. 11. Wray was part of a key team working to protect national security after the attack. &#8220;In our torture database, which we created through documents we received under the Freedom of Information Act, Chris Wray is named on 29 documents,&#8221; Cole said. &#8220;And these are all documents related to the Bush administration&#8217;s use of torture and coercive interrogation tactics against detainees.&#8221; Wray\u2019s responses to the mistreatment of detainees were redacted, however, so we simply don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n<p>2) What is your diversity plan?<\/p>\n<p>The FBI is astonishingly white. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fbijobs.gov\/working-at-FBI\/diversity\">FBI\u2019s own statistics<\/a>, 83% of special agents, 78% of intelligence analysts, and 69% of professional staff are white. And the numbers are getting worse, not better.<\/p>\n<p>Former director Comey <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/10\/fbi-so-white-why-losing-comey-matters\/\">considered this an emergency<\/a> and a priority. In fact, he was preparing to attend a diversity recruitment event in Los Angeles when he was fired. \u201cWe have a crisis in the FBI and it is this: Slowly but steadily over the last decade or more, the percentage of special agents in the FBI who are white has been growing,\u2019\u2019 he said <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/fbi-director-comey-calls-agencys-lack-of-diversity-a-crisis-1468426138\">in a speech<\/a> to security professionals about a year ago. \u201cI will have failed if I don\u2019t change this.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s now up to the next FBI chief.<\/p>\n<p>Former F.B.I Section Chief Robert Cromwell (and <em>raceAhead <\/em>reader) has written a book on his time at the FBI called <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B01K0T4FFG\/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">Fugitive Man: Hunting Violent Criminals for the FBI and Searching for Justice for the Innocent Convict<\/a>. <\/em>In it, he talks about his own experience in both law enforcement and recruiting. \u201cDirector Mueller recognized the importance of diversity in our ranks, and monitored hiring statistics closely,\u201d he writes. \u201cWith his support, we conducted numerous recruiting initiatives aimed at women and people of color. While we gave it a good try, the FBI could certainly do better.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The lack of diversity within the ranks of the FBI represents an operational shortcoming, says Cromwell. \u201cThe widely accepted corporate argument for diversity predicts a more efficient and functional organization when the organization reflects its customer base,\u201d he says. It\u2019s even more critical for law enforcement. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s bottom line is not expressed in profit or loss. The FBI\u2019s bottom line involves success in preventing terrorist attacks, catching spies, solving major crimes, and saving lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ask Wray for his diversity plan,

A 10% sales tax goes to the Nevada&#8217;s rainy day fund, but a 15% cultivation tax on cannabis sales goes to the public education budget.<\/p>\n<p>If the supply problem isn&#8217;t remedied, it could take some serious bake sales to make up for the lost baked sales.<\/p>\n<p>Nevada isn&#8217;t alone in allocating some of its pot tax revenue to education. Of the other four states where recreational marijuana is legal, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington all direct some funds to schools.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colorado has a 10% retail marijuana sales tax and a 15% retail excise tax. Marijuana tax revenue contributed more than $65 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorado.gov\/pacific\/sites\/default\/files\/2016%20Annual%20Report.pdf\">to public education <\/a>in the state over the last two years.<\/li>\n<li>Oregon has a 17% state tax, with the option for municipalities to add up to 3% local tax. Forty percent of the tax revenue goes to the state\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oregon.gov\/DOR\/press\/Documents\/marijuana_fact_sheet.pdf\">Common School Fund.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Washington has a 15% tax on wholesale marijuana and an 8% state tax on retail sales prices as of this month, down from 10% before that. Nearly <a href=\"http:\/\/lcb.wa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/annual_report\/2016-annual-report-Final-opt.pdf\">one third of marijuana tax revenue<\/a> goes to the state\u2019s general fund which can be used for education and other critical services.<\/li>\n<li>In Alaska, the tax is $50 per ounce, or about a 20% effective tax rate on cultivators. Half of the tax revenue goes to the state\u2019s general fund, half has been allocated to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adn.com\/alaska-marijuana\/2016\/07\/12\/heres-where-half-of-the-revenue-from-alaskas-legal-pot-will-go\/\">criminal reform programs.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But Nevada is the only state with a grower to seller ratio that could undermine the industry&#8217;s success, Joel Milton told the Reno Gazette Journal. He&#8217;s CEO of Baker, a company that helps dispensaries with marketing and management.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Colorado, we have more than two-and-a-half times as many cultivators as dispensaries, and in Washington, there are one-and-a-half more. In Nevada, there is a lower ratio, it is about one to one. Based on these numbers, it will put a big strain on supply because demand is about to grow tremendously,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2060163\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/13\/marijuana-industry-growth-threatened-by-jeff-sessions-position-on-pot\/marijuana_map\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=1024&#038;h=755\" data-orig-size=\"2500,1843\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"marijuana_map\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=1024&#038;h=755?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=1024&#038;h=755?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2060163\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=1024&#038;h=755\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"755\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=1024&amp;h=755 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=2048&amp;h=1510 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=150&amp;h=111 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=300&amp;h=221 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/marijuana_map.png?w=768&amp;h=566 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a>It didn&#8217;t take long for legalized marijuana to run into problems in Nevada.

Thursday, right? Well, today I invite you to a first-ever installment of We-Were-There Wednesday, a brief look back at some stellar <em>Fortune<\/em> journalism from the past that sheds light on the news of today.<\/p>\n<p>First, I invite you to re-read Shawn Tully&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/21\/snapchat-snap-ipo-wall-street\/\">brutal takedown<\/a> from March of the craven way Snap&#8217;s bankers handled its IPO. He called the IPO an &#8220;epic fleecing&#8221; of retail investors. Things have gotten worse for Snap\u2014though I truly enjoyed its Ferris Wheel in Cannes last month\u2014as investors have become increasingly jittery that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> will eat Snapchat&#8217;s lunch. Analysts at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a>, one of Snap\u2019s underwriters, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/snapchat-stock-price-morgan-stanley\/\">lowered their targets<\/a> for Snap&#8217;s shares Tuesday. They fell 9% to $15.47, below their $17 offering price and nearly half their high of $29 and change.<\/p>\n<p>Next, I please look back at the devil of a time the venerable publisher and education company Pearson was having repositioning itself a couple years ago. Jennifer Reingold&#8217;s<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/21\/everybody-hates-pearson\/\"> look at Pearson\u2019s problems<\/a> is a classic examination at how tough it is to turn around giant organizations. Pearson is ditching its stake in book publisher Penguin Random House, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/11\/business\/dealbook\/pearson-penguin-random-house-bertelsmann.html?em_pos=small&amp;emc=edit_dk_20170711&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;nl_art=3&amp;nlid=1411878&amp;ref=headline&amp;te=1&amp;_r=0\">a move that will get it money but not much else<\/a>, says Liam Proud of Reuters Breakingviews.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I highly recommend David Whitford&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2013\/05\/23\/whats-driving-one-of-chinas-richest-men\/\">penetrating look from 2013 at Wang Jianlin, the entrepreneur behind property developer and entertainment conglomerate Wanda Group<\/a>. Wang was in the ascendance four years ago, just as <em>Fortune<\/em> was convening its Fortune Global Forum in Chengdu in Western China. Tuesday&#8217;s <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em> details how Wang and Wanda are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dalian-wanda-to-sell-hotels-cultural-and-tourism-projects-for-9-3-billion-1499658113\">scaling back their ambitions<\/a> after bulking up on too much debt.<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward, another item caught my eye Tuesday. Mobike, the Chinese bikesharing startup that along with its chief competitor Ofo has raised more than $1 billion, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/article_email\/china-bike-sharing-titan-mobike-sets-sights-on-washington-d-c-1499702471-lMyQjAxMTI3MDE2MTgxODExWj\/\">looking to expand to Washington, D.C.<\/a> Before that happens, Mobike plans a humbler but equally exciting test. It will have 15 bikes at the disposal of guests at the Brainstorm Tech conference next week in Aspen. I plan to be among the first to try them. I&#8217;ll post a photo.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<table class=\"container\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;font-family: Georgia;font-size:16px;line-height: 24px;width: 90%;max-width: 602px;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 30%;\"><\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: right;

One of the largest icebergs in recorded history <a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectmidas.org\/blog\/calving\/\">broke free from Antarctica<\/a> sometime between July 10 and 12, the product of a fast-moving crack in the ice shelf.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;one trillion tonne&#8221; iceberg, likely to be named A68, is about the size of Delaware and contains enough water to fill Lake Erie twice, the researchers estimate. The scientists behind the Larsen C prediction are part of an Antarctic research group called Project MIDAS that investigates how global climate change impacts the ice shelf.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Although this is a natural event, and we\u2019re not aware of any link to human-induced climate change, this puts the ice shelf in a very vulnerable position,&#8221; said Martin O\u2019Leary, a Swansea University glaciologist and member of the MIDAS project team, in a statement on the group&#8217;s website. &#8220;This is the furthest back that the ice front has been in recorded history.

The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has pointed out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aacn.nche.edu\/media-relations\/fact-sheets\/nursing-shortage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similarly troubling trends<\/a> such as an aging nurse workforce and shortfall against expected demand.<\/p>\n<p>One digital solution likely isn&#8217;t enough to overcome these major systemic issues (that would also require regulatory and legislative changes). But Nazem hopes that it can help mitigate an under-appreciated need in medicine.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 02:40:02","updated":"2017-07-11 02:40:02","minute":"2:40 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/healthcare-digital-health-gig-economy-nomad\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/healthcare-digital-health-gig-economy-nomad\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/healthcare-digital-health-gig-economy-nomad\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"The Gig Economy May Be Coming to a Nurse Near You","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"7\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5420946834001-7\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5420946834001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2v9t6AV\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/health_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbrainstormhealth%2Cdigitalhealthcompanies%2Cfdaregulations%2Chealth%2Chealthregulations%26ch%3Dhealth%26topic%3Dbrainstormhealth&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"Startup Nomad Health is expanding its digital staffing service to medicine's foot soldiers.","authors":[{"id":"1572535","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/sayak-mukherjee\/","name":"Sy Mukherjee","twitter":"the_sy_guy","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1648770\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=1648770\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Sy Mukherjee\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/1x_editorsname1.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Sy Mukherjee has been a writer at <em>Fortune<\/em> since 2016 with a focus on health, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology.

Together, the studies\u2014both published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine\u2014<\/em>tracked more than 700,000 participants for an average of around 16 years. Results were consistent: coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of early death, particularly from heart and gut disease.<\/p>\n<p>The first study, which comprised of around 186,000 Americans, found that participants who consumed two or more cups a day were 18% less likely to die by the study\u2019s close (this was after the authors controlled for diet, exercise, smoking, among other factors). In the second study, which examined coffee consumption among more than 520,000 Europeans from 10 countries, found a similar effect: coffee drinkers were less likely to die than non-coffee drinkers.<\/p>\n<p>Before you run to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/starbucks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks<\/a>, it\u2019s important to note that correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation.

But coffee wasn&#8217;t necessarily the differentiating factor that reduced the risk of premature death. The study didn\u2019t control for everything\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-40567047\">according to the BBC<\/a>, it did not consider socio-economic status or social habits, for example.

href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/10\/health\/coffee-leads-to-longer-life-studies-reaffirm\/index.html\">healthier to begin with<\/a>, as many people who avoid the drink do so because of existing

healthy diet and lifestyle,&#8221; Veronica Wendy Setiawan, who led the European study, told CNN. &#8220;This study and the previous studies suggest that for a majority of people, there&#8217;s no

neutrality rules, said it would join an online protest this week in favor of keeping the rules.<\/p>\n<p>In recognition of the &#8220;Day of Action&#8221; on July 12, the company said it would display on its website banners in favor of maintaining a &#8220;free and open&#8221; Internet.

After courts had struck down two earlier attempts to protect online openness saying the agency lacked the authority, the FCC under Obama-appointee Tom Wheeler classified Internet service providers as &#8220;common carriers&#8221; much like phone carriers. The designation, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2016\/06\/14\/471286113\/u-s-appeals-court-holds-up-net-neutrality-rules-in-full\">satisfied the courts<\/a> but stoked fears among the companies that they could be subject to more regulation in the future, including price controls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Saddling modern broadband infrastructure and investment decisions with heavy-handed, outdated telephone regulations creates an environment of market uncertainty that does little to advance internet openness,&#8221; AT&amp;T&#8217;s Quinn wrote in his blog post. &#8220;Instead, it jeopardizes the prospects for continued innovation and robust growth we have witnessed since the internet\u2019s creation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But net neutrality supporter Greer pointed out that the rules needed a strong legal underpinning after lawsuits by Internet service providers cut down earlier attempts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous, and a blatant attempt to confuse the public, that they are claiming they are joining a grassroots online protest that&#8217;s explicitly intended to defend the Title II based net neutrality protections that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support,&#8221; Greer said.<\/p>\n<p>AT&amp;T was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/02\/fcc-verizon-att-net-neutrality\/\">under investigation<\/a> by the FCC last year for potentially violating the net neutrality rules, but Pai dismissed the probe.

Revelations","content":"<p>Fresh off one foreign trip and preparing for another, Donald Trump was enjoying a period of relative calm\u2014until the White House was rocked by a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton-russia\/\">fresh controversy<\/a> over contacts between the president&#8217;s campaign and Russia.<\/p>\n<p>For Trump, who has been swept up all year in crises of his own making, this time the target was his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., whose <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/donald-trump-jr-russia-russian-lawyer-meeting\/\">meeting with a Russian lawyer<\/a> last year led to accusations that the president&#8217;s son entertained working with Russians to spread negative information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.<\/p>\n<p>Among Trump&#8217;s wide-ranging group of outside advisers and former campaign officials, Donald Jr.&#8217;s meeting with the lawyer on the expectation of gaining access to negative information on Clinton was seen as problematic, a demonstration of the son&#8217;s political inexperience, but not illegal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t shrug this off even though you know he&#8217;s very likely going to be okay,&#8221; said an outside Trump adviser, who asked to remain unidentified. &#8220;This is the president&#8217;s namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the president&#8217;s son.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind that every person in the White House has some level of concern about this. Otherwise it&#8217;s malpractice,&#8221; the adviser said.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russia&#8217;s meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president&#8217;s agenda.<\/p>\n<p>The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/angela-merkel-ivanka-trump-g20\/\">trip<\/a> to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/trump-putin-russia-election-interference\/\">meeting<\/a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He knows that he didn&#8217;t do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesn&#8217;t like it when things get in the way,&#8221; a senior White House official said.<\/p>\n<p>The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his &#8220;high-quality person&#8221; who showed &#8220;transparency&#8221; by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, it&#8217;s still not a smoking gun,&#8221; said one former campaign adviser.<\/p>\n<p>Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p>Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/quinhillyer.com\/trump-should-resign\/\">in a blog post<\/a> that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. &#8220;The American people absolutely cannot trust Trump\u2019s objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions,&#8221; Hillyer wrote. &#8220;This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case &#8220;unfortunately supports the narrative&#8221; advanced by Trump&#8217;s Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic,&#8221; the adviser said. &#8220;A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

traveling through Trump country (West Virginia and Kentucky) last weekend in an effort to rally opposition to Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. These efforts notwithstanding, Sanders still refuses to embrace Obamacare. \u201cAs soon as we defeat this disastrous bill, I will be introducing a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program,\u201d he said during the rally. He hasn\u2019t even embraced the Democratic Party, despite his bid to become the Democratic presidential nominee. When asked if he was a Democrat, he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2017\/07\/bernie-sanders-health-care-republicans-trump\/533109\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responded<\/a>, \u201cNot even remotely anymore. The Democratic Party now is a disaster, an absolute mess. I don\u2019t see a party now that represents me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sanders still describes himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d rejecting the moderate left progressivism of the Clintons, as he emphasized in his presidential campaign. According to Sanders, the Clintons embraced Wall Street, where Hillary Clinton had made hundreds of thousands of dollars giving speeches, following in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, who during his presidency had deregulated banks by signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, repealing the Glass-Steagall cornerstone of New Deal banking reform. The Clintons had accommodated consolidations and mergers in the world of banking, they had encouraged the growth of too-big-to-fail big banks, and Sanders was the only candidate willing to take on <a href=\"https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/reforming-wall-street\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wall Street<\/a> and break up the big banks.<\/p>\n<p>Putting aside the question of the practicality of a break-up-the-big-banks reform agenda, we should pose a simpler, conceptual question first: Why would a socialist want to break up big banks? Socialists want to nationalize banks, not break them up. If anything, socialists prefer bank consolidation to simplify the administrative task of running a nationalized banking system. Nationalization is the only path to provide the collective ownership of the means of production (in this case, the production of financial products). Socialism entails the abolition of private property in business life, but breaking up banks would leave banks as privately owned enterprises still seeking to make profits through the marketplace. Socialists argue that profit-making in a competitive market leads inevitably to exploitation and alienation.<\/p>\n<p>The proposal to break up the banks sounds more like the trust-busting Progressive Era agenda one would associate with Woodrow Wilson than anything socialist. Eugene Debs, not Woodrow Wilson, was the socialist of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/progressive\/\" target=\"_blank\">Progressive<\/a> Era, and Debs had been sufficiently schooled in Marxist theory to realize that socialism required the abolition or private ownership of the means of production. Sanders admires Debs (he had a picture of Debs displayed in City Hall when he was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/powerpost\/wp\/2016\/01\/22\/the-daily-202-bernie-sanders-has-a-eugene-v-debs-problem\/?utm_term=.1152d30725f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mayor<\/a> of Burlington, Vt., but it isn\u2019t clear he understood the radical agenda Debs had embraced. Is it possible that the only prominent national politician who describes himself as a socialist today is clueless regarding the meaning to the term socialism?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/democratic-socialism-in-the-united-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prepared remarks<\/a> by Sanders on democratic socialism suggest as much. He begins his commentary on democratic socialism by focusing on Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1937 inaugural address, where Roosevelt famously stated that one-third of the nation was &#8220;ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.\u201d Sanders identifies with FDR and his campaign against the \u201ceconomic royalists,\u201d praising New Deal policies for succeeding in putting \u201cmillions back to work\u201d and taking \u201cthem out of poverty\u201d and restoring \u201ctheir faith in government.\u201d Democrats would almost universally share these laudatory views of Franklin Roosevelt, but Sanders proceeds to note that almost everything FDR proposed was called &#8220;socialist.\u201d Does this make FDR a socialist? The implication of Sanders\u2019 logic, given that he embraces both FDR and democratic socialism, is that because FDR\u2019s enemies labeled his agenda socialist, he was a socialist. FDR\u2019s political enemies also called him a dictator, especially after he introduced his court-packing bill. Did that make FDR a dictator?<\/p>\n<p>Later in his speech, Sanders finally defines what democratic socialism means to him. \u201cDemocratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy,\u201d he said. Adam Smith, the author of the <em>The Wealth of Nations<\/em> in 1776 and the father of capitalism, would have said that capitalism intends to &#8220;create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy&#8221; (Sanders\u2019 definition of democratic socialism).<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"8\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5219073860001-8\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5219073860001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uf0TfU\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dberniesanders%2Cdonaldtrump%2Cinfrastructureplan%2Cinfrastructureplanscam%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dberniesanders&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Sanders concedes, \u201cI don\u2019t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth deserve a fair deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sanders isn\u2019t a socialist.

Given the dismal history of socialism in the 20th century, which is inextricably intertwined with the history of totalitarianism, Sanders would do well to start using words with their conventional meaning.

Just days after setting those records, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-coinbase-down\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crashed as much as 25%<\/a> in a single day, and have so far been unable to recover.<\/p>\n<p>The Ethereum price is currently under $190, down more than 50% from its high less than a month ago.

In early June, Mark Cuban tweeted about cryptocurrency, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s in a bubble,&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/mark-cuban-twitter-bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompting the price of Bitcoin to swoon 5%<\/a>. Two weeks ago, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, who has 10% of his wealth invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/29\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-buy-michael-novogratz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said he&#8217;d been selling many of his coins<\/a>, suspecting that the digital currencies had already peaked for the year. Cryptocurrency, Novogratz further predicted, &#8220;is going to be the single greatest bubble of our lifetime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Goldman Sachs itself weighed in, <a href=\"http:\/\/and Goldman Sachs: http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/03\/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-price\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warning that Bitcoin could fall<\/a> another 19% from its current levels, to as low as $1,857.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if cryptocurrency really is in a bubble, it poses less of a danger to the rest of the market if it pops than other bubbles\u2014from housing to tech stocks\u2014have historically when they burst. After all, unlike stocks and bonds, which are intricately entwined with big banks and the world financial system, Bitcoin and Ethereum exist in almost a parallel universe to conventional assets, with only tenuous links to traditional Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the price went to zero tomorrow,&#8221; Turnill noted, there likely would be no &#8220;broader financial impact at all&#8221; on any other assets. &#8220;But it\u2019s an example of where you\u2019re getting big price movements in the market,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, that&#8217;s why BlackRock is keeping tabs on cryptocurrency in the first place: Not as a prospective investment at this time, but as a potential indicator of sentiment and investor behavior in other asset classes\u2014whether gold, standard paper currency, bonds, or technology stocks.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin &#8220;can be a signal of the macro environment,&#8221;

Overall, 12% of adults <a href=\"http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/2sUQIYJ\">said they did the same thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Subscription revenue is likely to come under scrutiny starting next week when TV industry players begin reporting quarterly earnings. Netflix, the dominant streaming service, releases its results on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>Up to now, Netflix and other streaming networks have accepted some password-sharing, but they may face pressure from investors to change course if new sign-ups slow substantially, Wall Street analysts said. Revenue growth at Netflix is projected to drop from 31% in this year&#8217;s second quarter to 19% in the second quarter of next year, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If Netflix goes from a 30% revenue growth story to a 10% story, there is absolutely going to be more focus on their leaving money on the table,&#8221; said Justin <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/patterson\/\" target=\"_blank\">Patterson<\/a>, an analyst with Raymond James.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Respondents to the Reuters\/Ipsos survey said they borrow passwords to save money on video subscriptions, which can be cheap on their own but add up with multiple services.<\/p>\n<p>Donielle Bradshaw, a live-in nanny in Smyrna, Georgia, said she uses her 28-year-old sister\u2019s password for Hulu, and her 32-year-old brother\u2019s password for Netflix.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like since we are family, it\u2019s OK,&#8221; said the 22-year-old Bradshaw, who estimates she watches four hours of shows on weeknights and 10 hours a day on weekends.<\/p>\n<p>If companies cracked down on password sharing, Bradshaw said she would be willing to pay for her own Netflix subscription but is not sure about Hulu, which is owned by several media companies. &#8220;I binge a lot of shows on Netflix. I don\u2019t think I could do without it,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Companies say they accept some sharing as a way to promote their programming to potential customers, but they also take steps to curtail blatant freeloading.<\/p>\n<p>Many networks limit the number of people who can watch programming at the same time. Netflix, for example, allows two to four simultaneous streams per subscription, depending on the plan, and charges more for the higher number of streams.<\/p>\n<p>HBO, a unit of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/time-warner\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time Warner<\/a>, actually encourages younger viewers to use its HBO Now and HBO Go services for free by offering it to about 100 U.S. colleges and universities.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more about Netflix, watch<\/em>: <div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"23\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5393939030001-23\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5393939030001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uOPZdK\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Chulu%2Cnetflix%2Cnetflixcompetition%2Cstreamingservices%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dnetflix&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For us it\u2019s more important that at that age where they are not financially independent quite yet, they are habituating to using the product to ultimately aspiring to becoming paid customers,&#8221; Bernadette Aulestia, executive vice president of global distribution, said in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix executives also have said they know some viewers share passwords.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We could crack down on it, but you wouldn&#8217;t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,&#8221; Netflix chief financial officer David Wells said at a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> conference last September.<\/p>\n<h2>Missing a chance<\/h2>\n<p>Industry analysts say companies are missing a chance to grow revenue.

On Wednesday, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Activision Blizzard<\/a> formally announced the owners of the first seven teams from the video gaming giant&#8217;s much-anticipated new city-based professional eSports league.<\/p>\n<p>The Overwatch League, which is set to launch at an unspecified date later this year, will feature teams based in major cities around the world comprised of professional gamers facing off at Activision Blizzard&#8217;s popular new game title, <em>Overwatch<\/em>. (For more on the game itself, which launched last year and now has more than 30 million players worldwide, read <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/\"><em>Fortune<\/em>&#8216;s profile<\/a> of Activision Blizzard that appeared in the <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 issue of the magazine last month.)<\/p>\n<p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon are among those who have signed agreements to participate in the league, and they will own Overwatch League team in Boston and New York, respectively, Activision Blizzard said in a press release. (Wilpon, the son of Mets owner Fred Wilpon, bought into the league through the venture capital fund Sterling.VC, in which he is a partner.) <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/22\/sacramento-kings-owner-says-new-nba-arena-was-designed-for-esports\/\">Andy Miller<\/a>, the co-owner of the NBA&#8217;s Sacramento Kings and the chairman of NRG eSports, will own the league&#8217;s San Francisco-based team. The other new team owners and cities include Noah Winston (Los Angeles), CEO of the <a href=\"http:\/\/deadline.com\/2017\/06\/aeg-extends-esports-ties-investment-popular-franchise-immortals-1202116562\/\">AEG-backed<\/a> eSports franchise Immortals, which also has funding from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/17662888\/memphis-grizzlies-owner-stephen-kaplan-increases-stake-immortals\">owner of the NBA&#8217;s Memphis Grizzlies<\/a>; Ben Spoont (Miami-Orlando), the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/15916893\/misfits-purchased-org-backed-syfy-co-founder-adds-ignar-hans\">Misfits Gaming<\/a>; Kevin Chou (Seoul), the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/10\/kabam-kevin-chou-secret-how-to-make-a-hit-videogame\/\">co-founder of mobile gaming company<\/a> Kabam; and, the Chinese internet company NetEase, which will run a team based in Shanghai.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Overwatch League will celebrate and reward our most accomplished players and give fans more opportunities to engage with each other,&#8221; Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement. &#8220;We\u2019re excited to be working with leaders from eSports and traditional sports to celebrate our players and to establish the <em>Overwatch<\/em> League.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/19872943\/new-england-patriots-robert-kraft-new-york-mets-fred-wilpon-six-owners-buy-new-esports-venture-overwatch-league\">ESPN report<\/a> citing anonymous sources last week was the first to identify some of the Overwatch League&#8217;s initial team owners. Nate Nanzer, Blizzard Entertainment&#8217;s former global eSports director, who will serve as commissioner of the Overwatch League, tells <em>Fortune<\/em> in an interview that additional teams could be announced before the league officially kicks off later this year. Activision Blizzard said on Wednesday that the league&#8217;s first season will see teams competing at regular season matches in Los Angeles, with the teams eventually developing their own local venues to set up &#8220;home and away&#8221; match-ups for future seasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em style=\"text-align:center;\">Get <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em><span style=\"text-align:center;\">Fortune<\/span><em style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8216;s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Overwatch League is the first major eSports league to be built like a traditional professional sports league, with each team attached to a specific city or region in order to build local fanbases. Activision Blizzard&#8217;s league also has the benefit of owning Major League Gaming, an organization that creates and distributes eSports events and coverage, which gives the company an obvious streaming outlet for self-distributing Overwatch League content on top of the money that Activision Blizzard expects to bring in through ticket sales, advertising, and merchandise. (Some Overwatch eSports events are included in a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/20\/twitch-activision-blizzard-esports-deal\/\">digital rights deal<\/a> that Activision Blizzard signed with Amazon&#8217;s streaming video service Twitch last month, but Nanzer said that Overwatch League events are not part of that deal at the moment.)<\/p>\n<p>The eSports industry is expected to pull in roughly $700 million this year and that total could be <a href=\"https:\/\/newzoo.com\/insights\/articles\/esports-revenues-will-reach-696-million-in-2017\/\">more than double by 2020<\/a>. Activision Blizzard plans to take advantage of the industry&#8217;s expected growth, with a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dotesports.com\/overwatch\/morgan-stanley-activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-data-report-13812\">report<\/a> earlier this year estimating that the league could pull in more than $100 million annually, mostly from content licensing and advertising initially. However, the company hopes the Overwatch League can eventually generate multi-billion-dollar annual revenues on par with traditional sports leagues, like the NFL. &#8220;The business model [of the NFL] is they create content, they build an audience around that content, and then they monetize the audience through media rights, sponsorship, merchandise, tickets, etc.&#8221; Nanzer tells <em>Fortune<\/em>. &#8220;The business model of the Overwatch League is exactly the same.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Overwatch<\/em> is actually not the most popular title developed by Activision Blizzard&#8217;s Blizzard Entertainment (the <em>Call of Duty<\/em> franchise has sold more than 250 million units, while <em>World of Warcraft<\/em> has more than 100 million registered users online), but the game&#8217;s following has grown rapidly since Activision Blizzard launched the title just last year, becoming the company&#8217;s fastest game to reach 30 million players. What&#8217;s more, other more established Activision Blizzard game titles are already widely played in existing eSports leagues, which is why the company believes it makes sense to make a fresh start by launching its own league with the newer title.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/19347153\/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms\">ESPN reported<\/a> that some prospective team owners had expressed concerns over the Overwatch League&#8217;s proposed financials, which reportedly include $20 million buy-ins for the team owners. (Nanzer declined to comment on the size of the owners&#8217; team purchases.) And while ESPN said at the time that prospective owners were balking at a lack of revenue-sharing, Activision Blizzard&#8217;s announcement on Tuesday notes that the league&#8217;s teams will receive equal shares of league-wide net revenue along with a set amount of local revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Nanzer contends that the league&#8217;s financial structure is &#8220;designed to create value for stakeholders for decades to come,&#8221; especially with regard to the attractive demographics (the eSports industry is especially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/tech-media\/2017\/02\/09\/esports-industry-expectations-billion-dollar\">popular with male millennials<\/a>) as well as the opportunity to grow local fanbases. &#8220;We think that by anchoring teams to cities, giving our teams exclusive territories, they&#8217;re going to be able to unlock significant revenues that are just not available in today&#8217;s eSports ecosystem,&#8221; Nanzer says.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 08:00:36","updated":"2017-07-12 08:00:36","minute":"8:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-owners-robert-kraft\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-owners-robert-kraft\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-owners-robert-kraft\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Activision Blizzard Lands Owners From NBA, NFL, MLB","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"25\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5461693639001-25\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5461693639001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2t1h3cx\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dactivision%2Cactivisionblizzard%2Cblizzard%2Ccallofduty%2Ccallofdutyinfinitewarfare%2Ccallofdutywwii%2Ccod%2Cesports%2Cesports%2Cfirstpersonshooter%2Cleague%2Cmlg%2Coverwatch%2Cworldofwarcraft%2Cwow%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dactivisionblizzard&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Including owners of the New England Patriots and Sacramento Kings.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"276852","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/tom-huddleston-jr\/","name":"Tom Huddleston, Jr.","twitter":"tjhuddle","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1595515\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=1595515\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Tom Huddleston\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Tom Huddleston, Jr. has been a writer at <em>Fortune<\/em> since 2014 with a focus on media and entertainment.

Those investors had already lost money on their investment as of Monday when Snap&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/snapchat-snap-stock-ipo-lock-up\/\">stock dipped below its $17 IPO price<\/a> for the first time ever.<\/p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley&#8217;s downgrade is a particularly hard hit for the company as the bank was the lead underwriter for Snap&#8217;s IPO, guiding the company through the process and helping determine its initial stock price. Typically, such underwriters become cheerleaders of the company after it officially goes public, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/06\/snapchat-wall-street-analysts-say-sell\/\">authoring &#8220;buy&#8221; or &#8220;hold&#8221; recommendations<\/a>. And Morgan Stanley was no exception.<\/p>\n<p>Following <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/27\/snap-stock-snapchat-wall-street-target\/\">Snap&#8217;s IPO<\/a>, Morgan Stanley gave Snap <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"snap\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/snap\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">snap<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> the equivalent of a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating and a 12-month target price of $28\u2014one of the most bullish on Wall Street at the time.<\/p>\n<p>But now, the bank has lowered its price target by 43% to $16 a share. That&#8217;s well below <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/snapchat-stock-price-time\/\">Snap&#8217;s IPO price<\/a>. (By Tuesday afternoon, Snap stock had already fallen below Morgan Stanley&#8217;s target.)<\/p>\n<p>So why the change of heart? According to the note, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak are now less convinced of Snap&#8217;s ability to grow. In fact, the analysts effectively refuted the main reasons why Snap&#8217;s biggest champions believed in the company at all: its apparent scalability and unique platform.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We have been wrong about Snap&#8217;s ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year (improving scalability, targeting, measurability, etc.) and user monetization,&#8221; Nowak wrote. &#8220;Snap&#8217;s ad product is not evolving\/improving as quickly as we expected and Instagram competition is increasing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Snap investors have grown increasingly wary of Facebook-owned <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-stories-video-photos\/\">Instagram<\/a>. In late June, Facebook announced that its Instagram Stories feature, which competes with Snapchat, had reached <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/20\/snap-stock-instagram-stories\/\"> 250 million daily active users<\/a>\u201450% higher than the 166 million daily active user base Snap reported in May.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe Instagram has become more aggressive in competing for Snap&#8217;s ad dollars,&#8221; Nowak wrote.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Morgan Stanley expects Snap to reach revenue of $897 million this year\u2014far lower than the $1 billion it once expected. Moreover, Morgan Stanley expects the company to reach just 182 million active users by the end of this year.<\/p>\n<p>The Morgan Stanley note also comes just a day after another of Snap&#8217;s IPO underwriters, Credit Suisse, lowered its target price on the company from $30 to $25, saying that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/20\/snap-stock-instagram-stories\/\">Snap&#8217;s stock price<\/a> could fall later this month when Snap&#8217;s lockup period begin to expire. That will allow many of Snap&#8217;s IPO backers and insiders to start selling their shares in the company.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Snap has a chance to wow investors with stronger earnings figures. It&#8217;s possible the company is working behind closed doors on a project that could potentially unlock growth.

Otherwise it&#8217;s malpractice,&#8221; the adviser said.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russia&#8217;s meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president&#8217;s agenda.<\/p>\n<p>The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/angela-merkel-ivanka-trump-g20\/\">trip<\/a> to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/trump-putin-russia-election-interference\/\">meeting<\/a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He knows that he didn&#8217;t do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesn&#8217;t like it when things get in the way,&#8221; a senior White House official said.<\/p>\n<p>The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his &#8220;high-quality person&#8221; who showed &#8220;transparency&#8221; by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, it&#8217;s still not a smoking gun,&#8221; said one former campaign adviser.<\/p>\n<p>Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<p>Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/quinhillyer.com\/trump-should-resign\/\">in a blog post<\/a> that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. &#8220;The American people absolutely cannot trust Trump\u2019s objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions,&#8221; Hillyer wrote. &#8220;This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case &#8220;unfortunately supports the narrative&#8221; advanced by Trump&#8217;s Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic,&#8221; the adviser said. &#8220;A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

fallen below its IPO price of $17 for the first time, roughly four months after the maker of Snapchat <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/01\/snap-ipo-buy-snapchat-stock-price\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">went public in March<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>After briefly <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/snapchat-stock-price-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">touching the $17 threshold<\/a> in mid-June, Snap&#8217;s stock price fell to an all-time low of $16.99 at market close on Monday. That means all the investors who bought into the disappearing-message app company&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/02\/snapchat-ipo-snap-stock\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">much-hyped<\/a> stock market debut have officially lost money.<\/p>\n<p>Most people who bought Snap <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"snap\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/snap\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">snap<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> stock, which opened its first trading day at $24\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/02\/snap-snapchat-ipo-stock-shares-buy-time\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">soaring 41%<\/a> out of the gate\u2014have lost even more. An <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/03\/snap-stock-snapchat-ipo-uber-bubble\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uber driver who invested when shares hit $25<\/a> on Snap&#8217;s IPO day has lost 32% of his money. And Snap has shed more than $10 billion in stock market value in the meantime, with its market cap, which once topped $31 billion, now at about $20 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Even as stocks of competing social media companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"fb\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">fb<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and Twitter <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"twtr\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/twitter\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">twtr<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> rose Monday, shares of Snap tumbled more than 1%, as Wall Street fretted that some of its biggest shareholders will dump their stock en masse later this month.<\/p>\n<p>While many of Snapchat&#8217;s IPO backers are currently prohibited from selling the stock during what&#8217;s known as a lock-up period, the expiration of those restrictions is less than three weeks away, on July 29. Even Snap&#8217;s bullish supporters are getting jittery about a potential stock plunge if those IPO shareholders decide to sell the first chance they get. Some insiders and pre-IPO investors will also be eligible to sell their stakes on that date, and some of them could theoretically sell at a profit even if Snap share prices stay below the IPO price.<\/p>\n<p>Credit Suisse, which has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Snap stock, slashed its target price from $30 to $25 Monday morning, noting that as many as 711 million shares\u2014or about 60% of all Snap stock\u2014could be sold when the lock-up expires.<\/p>\n<p>There are also doubts about Snapchat&#8217;s ability to grow and attract advertising dollars as fast as investors had hoped. &#8220;While we were hoping for Snap to exhibit a more comfortable growth path, we are reminded that nascent companies sometimes grow in fits and starts,&#8221; Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note explaining the target price cut.<\/p>\n<p>Due to a delayed rollout of a new platform designed to make it easier to buy ads on Snapchat, Ju also lowered his expectations for how much Snap made in revenue last quarter, which the company will disclose when it next reports earnings later this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Credit Suisse, along with Wall Street as a whole, no longer believes Snap will reach $1 billion in sales this year\u2014a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/30\/snapchat-snap-stock-profit-amazon-tesla-twitter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goal once considered key<\/a> in justifying Snap&#8217;s lofty valuation. Though the company has yet to make a profit, Snap stock trades at more than 20 times estimated 2017 sales; by that measure, it&#8217;s nearly twice as expensive as Facebook stock.<\/p>\n<p>That also sets Snap investors up for disappointment if Snapchat fails to live up to their hopes, as illustrated by their reactions to the company&#8217;s first public earnings report in May. When those results missed analysts&#8217; expectations by a long shot, Snap stock <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/11\/snapchat-snap-evan-spiegel-facebook-mark-zuckerberg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plummeted 25%<\/a> in a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Some investors who bought Snap stock since its IPO, but who were not bound by the lock-up period, have already decided to bail: A couple of Fidelity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Flex Large Cap Growth fund, which maintained a small position in Snap, sold almost half their shares in May.<\/p>\n<p>As the lock-up expiration date approaches, other owners of Snap stock may wish to follow suit.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 10, 2017","published":"2017-07-10 07:39:16","updated":"2017-07-10

Gabalda\u2014AFP\/Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Singapore Airlines is named the top international airline in the world for the 21st year by Travel+Leisure. The airline is the flag carrier of Singapore with its hub at the Singapore Changi Airport and flies to 62 destinations in 32 countries on five continents. The airline was the first customer for the Airbus A380, the world\u2019s largest passenger aircraft. In October of 2015, the airline announced it will resume the world\u2019s longest non-stop flight from Singapore to Newark which was launched in 2013. This was the longest flight ever recorded at 18 hours each way. The flight\u2019s cabins include suites, first class, business class, premium economy, and economy. Singapore Airline&#8217;s suites are known to be incredibly luxurious and were designed by the French luxury yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste, and can only be found on the A380 planes. The airline is known to be the first and only commercial airline to offer double beds in its aircraft. But passengers say the best part of the flights isn&#8217;t the features but the service. The airline has strict standards for their men and women crew which involves a 15-week training program &#8211; longer than the industry standard.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Emirates<\/li>\n<li>Qatar<\/li>\n<li>Cathay<\/li>\n<li>Japan Airlines<\/li>\n<li>Virgin Atlantic<\/li>\n<li>Air New Zealand<\/li>\n<li>Korean Air<\/li>\n<li>All Nippon Airways<\/li>\n<li>Eva Air<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 01:42:05","updated":"2017-07-11 01:42:05","minute":"1:42 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/this-is-the-best-airline-in-the-world\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/this-is-the-best-airline-in-the-world\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/this-is-the-best-airline-in-the-world\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"29\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5502366486001-29\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5502366486001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2v8xQH5\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/travel_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbestairlineintheworld%2Csingaporeairline%2Cworldsbestairline%2Cworldsworstairline%2Cworstairlineintheworld%26ch%3Dtravel%26topic%3Dbestairlineintheworld&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Singapore Airlines tops the charts &#8211; maintaining their 21-year streak. <\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"2046289","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/krishna-thakker\/","name":"Krishna Thakker","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":1875350,"name":"Executive Travel","slug":"executive-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":129962,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice to help globe-trotting executives travel smarter.

One of the largest icebergs in recorded history <a href=\"http:\/\/www.projectmidas.org\/blog\/calving\/\">broke free from Antarctica<\/a> sometime between July 10 and 12, the product of a fast-moving crack in the ice shelf.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;one trillion tonne&#8221; iceberg, likely to be named A68, is about the size of Delaware and contains enough water to fill Lake Erie twice, the researchers estimate. The scientists behind the Larsen C prediction are part of an Antarctic research group called Project MIDAS that investigates how global climate change impacts the ice shelf.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Although this is a natural event, and we\u2019re not aware of any link to human-induced climate change, this puts the ice shelf in a very vulnerable position,&#8221; said Martin O\u2019Leary, a Swansea University glaciologist and member of the MIDAS project team, in a statement on the group&#8217;s website. &#8220;This is the furthest back that the ice front has been in recorded history. We\u2019re going to be watching very carefully for signs that the rest of the shelf is becoming unstable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The worry is less about a new iceberg for sailors to avoid and more about the events that might come next. Researchers believe the recent split could trigger a collapse of the entire Larsen C ice shelf, a catastrophe that could potentially raise worldwide sea levels by four inches and in turn threaten the global economy.

But he was, of course, an agent of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, acting on his father\u2019s behalf, when he arranged the meeting with the Russian lawyer. The younger Trump successfully invited to that meeting senior campaign brass, including campaign manager Paul Manafort. Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior advisor, and Manafort are included on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justsecurity.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/donald-jr-emails-russia.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">entire email chain<\/span><\/a> reflecting in clear terms the Russian government\u2019s support for the Trump campaign and the scheduling of the meeting so that a Russian government lawyer could tender negative information on Clinton.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not an individual venture of Trump Jr.\u2019s that the Trump campaign can somehow disavow. While the individuals in question may not escape liability, the serious issue raised by the meeting exposes the campaign <i>as an organization<\/i> to criminal legal jeopardy. Any illegal solicitation of support from Russia is also the campaign\u2019s illegal solicitation. It was for the campaign\u2019s benefit that its leadership expressed interest in what the lawyer had to say.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Under campaign finance regulations, the meeting could without question be considered a solicitation (at least under the facts so far known). The law defines a solicitation to include any request for a contribution or \u201canything of value\u201d from a foreign government or entity, even if the request is implicit in the circumstances rather than expressly communicated. The regulations provide specifically that the solicitation \u201cmay be made directly or indirectly,\u201d based on all relevant factors, including the \u201cconduct of the persons involved in the communication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consider the email exchange Trump Jr. released on Twitter on Tuesday. The emails contained a clear offer of information from Russian government sources that might be helpful to the campaign. Trump Jr. responded, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d That is, he would glad to have the content described by the intermediary for the Russians. He then scheduled the meeting to consider whatever the Russians had. All these facts together indicate that, rather than declining the offer and rejecting a meeting, the campaign was communicating its interest in receiving this negative material. For campaign finance law purposes, and in the words of the ban on solicitations, the campaign was issuing \u201ca clear message\u201d that the Russians provide something \u201cof value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The campaign now must answer whether any overtures to Russia were part of a concerted effort to have foreign national support for the Trump candidacy. President Trump famously and publicly appealed to Russia for help in locating the deleted Clinton emails, but later claimed that he was only joking. And some have thought that perhaps Trump Jr. went rogue and acted, out of inexperience, on his own. But the email string released by Trump Jr., which was copied to the campaign management, followed by the meeting attended by senior campaign leadership, reveals a campaign aware of offers of Russian support and expressing eagerness to accept it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the campaign is Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, his authorized committee for seeking election to the presidency. Was he aware that the campaign was courting assistance from the Russian government?

Amazon","content":"<p>It is too early for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> to declare victory for its 3rd annual <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/07\/11\/amazon-customers-are-shopping-at-record-levels-on-prime-day.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime Day<\/a>, but the signals look good. Revenues from the highly discounted sales during the 30-hour event are likely to top $1 billion for the first time. A big chunk of the sales will involve Amazon\u2019s own products, like the Echo, Dot, and Kindle. And that is the real prize for the company. While Black Friday is about volumes, Prime Day is about platforms.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-accounts-for-43-of-us-online-retail-sales-2017-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a> already controls the largest U.S. online marketplace, accounting for about 40% of all online retail transactions. However, in order to maintain the 20% annual revenue growth it has promised the markets, it needs to add about $28 billion in new revenues each year. Amazon Prime is a great way to get there.<\/p>\n<p>Prime subscriber numbers are hard to come by, but most sources estimate that there are about 80 million <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-prime-subscribers-hit-80-million-2017-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime members<\/a> worldwide, most of them in the U.S. Each member pays about $100 per year for free two-day shipping and other benefits, like preferential access to Amazon\u2019s content libraries. Thus, Prime accounts for about $8 billion a year of direct revenues to Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. However, that is just the beginning. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/07\/11\/amazon-prime-customers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime members<\/a> spend about twice as much annually as non-members on Amazon sites\u2014about $1,200 compared to $500. Thus, Prime members account for a massive $96 billion of Amazon\u2019s $135 billion in annual revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Prime Day deals are only available to Amazon Prime members. For this reason, Prime Day has always been more about driving new Prime memberships than new sales. By this yard stick, the annual event has been phenomenally successful. Even though Prime has been around for 10 years, Prime memberships have <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oregonlive.com\/window-shop\/index.ssf\/2017\/07\/amazon_prime_day_evolution.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doubled<\/a> since the first Prime Day in 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Prime membership is also a great way for Amazon to distance itself from online retail competitors like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/best-buy\/\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy<\/a>, who have less robust platforms, and from manufacturers, like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> and Samsung, whose e-commerce businesses are relatively weak. Apple, for example, has largely failed to leverage its two largest platforms\u2014iTunes and the App Store\u2014into more mainstream consumer marketplaces. The size of Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business and the lock-in effect of Prime create very powerful network effects.<\/p>\n<p>However, the focus of Prime Day will soon need to change. Now that about one quarter of U.S. households have Prime memberships, Amazon is reaching natural demographic limits to growth. Thus, Amazon will have to move from a focus on signing up new Prime members (a hunting strategy) to increasing the share-of-wallet of existing members (a farming strategy). As we have seen by the shifts required in the telecom business when mobile phone penetration approached 100%, hunting and farming require very different skill sets.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"36\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5500651042001-36\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5500651042001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2ueNEvt\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Camazonprimeday2017%2Cdeals%2Cprimeday%2Cretail%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Damazon&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately for Amazon, good farming practices, like providing excellent customer service, are already in place. However, it has a long way to go before the promise of \u2018Christmas in July\u2019 can be fully realized. It is also worth mentioning that Amazon is a relative global amateur in the branded sales day arena. Alibaba realized $18 billion in revenues on its \u2018Singles Day\u2019 in 2016.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon has a good head start with Prime Day, but its lead is not unassailable.

According to tech news site <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/7\/5\/15922348\/dark-web-alphabay-market-exit-scheme-4-million-bitcoin\">the Verge<\/a>, bitcoin transaction records show AlphaBay&#8217;s shutdown coincided with a series of sudden withdrawals of $4 million from small accounts\u2014suggesting the site owners pocketed their customers&#8217; bitcoins.<\/p>\n<p>As AlphaBay remains dark, online discussion at online message board Reddit and elsewhere reflect rage and frustration among its customers. As this remark on Twitter shows, some are threatening to retaliate against AlphaBay by publishing the identities of its operators on the open Internet:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Things are getting messy over in alphabay reddit. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/AraJrmaZvz\">pic.twitter.com\/AraJrmaZvz<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Nic\u25fe&quot;Content&quot;\u26d3Carter (@nic__carter) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nic__carter\/status\/883686318806638592\">July 8, 2017<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Meanwhile, opportunists have also popped up who are purporting to offer a means for AlphaBay users to get into the site, but whose real purpose is to steal information about the user:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Person who posted link claims it&#39;s for AlphaBay<br \/>&gt; tested with dummy creds<br \/>&gt; just redirects to real AlphaBay which is down<br \/>&gt; nice phish bro <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/MvPzKCEDGQ\">pic.twitter.com\/MvPzKCEDGQ<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Joseph Cox (@josephfcox) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/josephfcox\/status\/883067208863281152\">July 6, 2017<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>For now, though, there is still no definite proof that AlphaBay&#8217;s disappearance is related to an exit scam. Some commenters are pointing to another explanation based on reports of arrests in Canada and Thailand\u2014this is possible evidence police seized the site&#8217;s servers and forced it offline. In a closely-read <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DarkNetMarkets\/comments\/6m5i1u\/postalphabay_speculation_everyone_should_be\/djz76rq\/\">message thread<\/a> on Reddit, one commenter warned users to be cautious if the site does reappear, suggesting law enforcement may relaunch AlphaBay in the hopes of collecting information about its customers.<\/p>\n<p>If AlphaBay is indeed finished, it will mark the end of the most notorious dark web site since the Silk Road, whose founder, Ross Ulbricht (known online as &#8220;Dread Pirate Roberts&#8221;), is now serving a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/05\/29\/ulbricht-sentenced-silk-road-crimes\/\">life sentence<\/a> after his conviction in 2015 for drug-related crimes. Ulbricht and others have defended the online drug markets as a libertarian ideal, while many others say the sites create a trail of misery in the form of overdose deaths.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 10, 2017","published":"2017-07-10 01:02:25","updated":"2017-07-10 01:02:25","minute":"1:02 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/exit-scam-fears-grow-drug-market-alphabay-stays-dark-one-week-later\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/exit-scam-fears-grow-drug-market-alphabay-stays-dark-one-week-later\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/exit-scam-fears-grow-drug-market-alphabay-stays-dark-one-week-later\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Exit Scam Fears Grow as AlphaBay Drug Site Stays Dark","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"39\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5314666481001-39\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5314666481001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2v3UFvI\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbradleymanning%2Cchelseamanning%2Ccybersecurity%2Cdarkweb%2Cdatadrop%2Cedwardsnowden%2Ctech%2Ctor%2Cwhistleblowers%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Ddatadrop&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Who took the bitcoins?<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1027427","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/jeff-john-roberts\/","name":"Jeff John Roberts","twitter":"jeffjohnroberts","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1600880\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/roberts-jeff-john\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Jeff-John Roberts\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Jeff John Roberts is a writer at <em>Fortune<\/em> with a focus on technology.

The IRS launched the investigation in part because the price of bitcoin soared from $13 to over $1,100 during the years in question, and because <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/19\/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit\/\">only 802<\/a> people reported their bitcoin gains or losses in 2015 to the agency.<\/p>\n<p>An IRS spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation&#8217;s new scope, which is limited\u2014in the agency&#8217;s words\u2014to users with &#8220;at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-15 period.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The modified request, first reported by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/20000-irs-exempt-casual-bitcoin-buyers-coinbase-data-request\/\">CoinDesk<\/a>, was set out in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/353433981\/Narrowed-Summons\">a court filing <\/a>titled &#8220;Notice of Narrowed Summons Request for Enforcement.&#8221; The filing also announced the IRS is limiting the scope of its request for the accounts. (You can see full details of those new limits below).<\/p>\n<p>The news comes as the IRS is locked in a closely-watched <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/15\/coinbase-irs\/\">court fight<\/a> with anonymous Coinbase users who want to a judge to block a summons the agency served on the company last year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s<\/em><em> technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If Coinbase had complied with the original summons, it would have forced it to turn over personal details related to over a million accounts, and over 500,000 active customer accounts. The scope of the summons caused an outcry among digital currency owners, and led senior members of Congress to send a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/21\/irs-bitcoin-congress\/\">sharply worded letter<\/a> to the IRS that warned its probe was &#8220;overly broad&#8221; and extremely burdensome.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps in response to this pressure, a lawyer for the IRS told a judge last week that the agency would no longer seek password and security settings for the accounts.<\/p>\n<p>The big question now is whether the concessions by the IRS will lead the anonymous Coinbase customers to withdraw their lawsuit, or whether they will push the court to limit the summons still further. Lawyers at the Los Angeles law firm Berns Weiss, which are representing the customers, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>Coinbase itself is not part of the lawsuit, but it has said it would join in if the IRS failed to limit the scope of the summons.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the San Francisco-based company declined to comment on the agency&#8217;s decision to only seek information on the larger accounts, and referred <em>Fortune<\/em> to a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-irs-update-8f3af2c18eb1\">blog post<\/a> from March.<\/p>\n<p>The IRS move did not appear to affect the price of bitcoin, which was trading <a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.wordpress.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2086703&amp;action=edit\">around $2,400<\/a> on Monday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, here are the other changes the IRS made to its request. The bold phrases are my summary of the changes, while the indented text is taken from the original summons followed by the limits set out in the July 6 court filing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Change 1: Eliminates request for payment information and security settings. <\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>ORIGINAL REQUEST: Account\/wallet\/vault registration records for each account\/wallet\/vault owned or

Bursts","content":"<p class=\"p1\">An imminent economic crisis the likes of which this generation has never experienced is coming. However, the conditions under which the next bubble will burst will surprise even the most astute observers of economy, culture, and politics. The higher education bubble (one-sixth of the U.S. economy) will likely burst with the force of all previous catastrophes combined\u2014a shock wave so sudden, so large, that it gathers the full force of the savings and loan, insurance, energy, tech, and mortgage crashes, creating a blockbuster-level perfect storm.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Disturbing patterns of unsustainable economic activity have emerged over the last decade. College and university budgets rely on inflated real estate investment, deny the short- and long-term effects of student loan defaults, accept the rise in tuition above the rate of inflation as normal, and expect a downsized part-time faculty to help subsidize inflated tenure track and endowed tenure budgetary lines. The insatiable upper administrative appetite for high salaries, job description absurdity, and low accountability adds endless layers of compulsive, prideful incompetence to an already unstable education business model that believes it simply cannot crash.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While higher education is not a business in the same way for-profit corporations are, a business plan rooted in reality remains essential to its success. Reality, however, seems an ongoing elusive concept to college administrators. Dormitories and sports facilities are funded regardless of flat enrollment rates. The mission of imparting knowledge to students (the service for which parents and students pay dearly) is shunted off to ill-paid adjunct faculty with no skin in the game. Students poorly equipped for real-world opportunities are unable to repay student loans, let alone become alumni willing and able to support their alma mater. How long until higher education\u2019s customer base realizes the expense is no longer worth it?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Without dramatic and immediate changes in the higher education sector, broader economies that support third-tier learning will fail along with it: People in the community employed by the college will lose their jobs; commercial activity geared toward the student population will fail; and investment in real estate for student housing will no longer have its expected return.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We call for a return to the teaching and innovation mission of the American university. We need a well-educated, resilient, adaptable, and entrepreneurial graduate to meet the needs of a new \u201cgig\u201d economy, which includes coding, plumbing, elder care, sociology, food service, and hotel management. We demand higher educators meet the market and personal demands of the new student body.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And while the teaching model will necessarily be heavily invested in digital knowledge, we must look to a very old style of teaching. The system of tenured professors more interested in research than in imparting knowledge, buttressed by overworked and precariously employed adjunct faculty, does nothing to stabilize a higher education community. An apprentice\/mentor system grounded in a proficiency model charged with technical, academic, and professional skill development and critical thinking objectives will revolutionize higher education.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We want our colleagues to focus on imparting the empathy that comes from interaction with other people, cultures, works of literature, and art, as well as the concrete and necessary skills for success in the post-college world of production, innovation, and hands-on work. We can deliver this high level of education while modeling what it means to have a true plan for paying for what is necessary.

But the star of the new vehicle is what Audi calls the &#8220;traffic jam pilot.&#8221; With a front camera along with a combination of LIDAR, radar and ultrasonic sensors, the A8 can autonomously take control of itself and drive in highway traffic up to about 37 miles per hour so long as a physical barrier separates the car from traffic in the oncoming lane.<\/p>\n<p>Audi says that a button on the A8&#8217;s center console can make the traffic jam pilot start, accelerate, steer and stop the vehicle. The automaker additionally claims that the function will allow drivers to completely remove their hands from the wheel and watch the car&#8217;s on-board television while the vehicle <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/14\/ford-argo-ai-self-driving-cars\/\">autonomously drives itself<\/a> (depending on local regulations.)<\/p>\n<p>When the A8 reaches its destination, another feature, the &#8220;remote parking pilot,&#8221; can direct the vehicle in and out of a parking spot or garage automatically. The driver doesn&#8217;t even need to be in the car \u2014 he or she can activate the system from an app on their smartphone. It&#8217;s unclear whether the route to the parking space needs to be pre-programmed, however.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:500px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n<div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n<div style=\" background:url(data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC\/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5\/P8\/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo\/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI\/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf\/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BWZoO_gBjha\/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Audi put an A8 mockup on a crane and it was sort of insane.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Roberto Baldwin (@strngwys) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2017-07-11T08:59:30+00:00\">Jul 11, 2017 at 1:59am PDT<\/time><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Moving to the interior, the A8&#8217;s 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment display allows users to access controls for voice functions, air conditioning, traffic information and more. The system&#8217;s navigation program is self-learning and adapts based on owners&#8217; driving history and search suggestions.<\/p>\n<p>The A8&#8217;s suspension is adaptable, capable of adjusting based on road conditions and drivers&#8217; preferences. With an additional feature Audi calls &#8220;pre sense 360,&#8221; the A8&#8217;s wheels will automatically raise if it senses an imminent side collision. Audi says that can reduce the potential damage for both vehicles involved in a crash.<\/p>\n<p>This being a $100,000-plus vehicle, there&#8217;s no shortage of luxury features. The rear right seat of the A8 comes with a footrest that will warm and massage the soles of a passenger&#8217;s feet. Rear passengers also get access to ambient light control, HD Matrix reading lights and a smartphone-size OLED display to control these features without needing to bother the driver.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the A8 may face some speed bumps along the way. Its autonomous driving features are <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/13\/waymo-firefly-google-alphabet-self-driving-cars\/\">limited<\/a> in markets that restrict the use of self-driving vehicles, for instance. Audi says it will be adopting a &#8220;step-by-step approach&#8221; to introducing the traffic jam pilot following the vehicle&#8217;s launch. The vehicle&#8217;s high price tag, meanwhile, means this isn&#8217;t a car for the masses. But if its self-driving tech is as good as Audi claims, the A8 could be an important stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11

full","is_magazine_content":"non-magazine","url":"\/2017\/06\/27\/best-companies-millennials\/","title":"This Is the Secret to Holding Onto Millennial Employees","content":"<p>Six in 10 Millennials\u2014the country\u2019s largest generation\u2014say they&#8217;re looking for new employment opportunities, according to a recent Gallup poll. The cost of that turnover is estimated to top $30 billion each year.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies continue to ponder what to do about the issue. Some C-level leaders have responded by adopting lavish perks and a fun atmosphere to appeal to the younger generation.<\/p>\n<p>Now, Great Place to Work\u2019s research on the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/best-workplaces-millennials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Best Workplaces for Millennials<\/a> shows this generational penchant to job-hop is avoidable when companies focus on one key thing\u2014building a high-trust culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou might find some initial benefits to ditching your dress code and throwing out cubicles,\u201dsaid Chinwe Onyeagoro, president of Great Place to Work.\u201cBut superficial changes like these won\u2019t improve retention among Millennials unless they\u2019re accompanied by managers making authentic connections with employees, linking their work and contributions to a broader purpose, providing access to a diverse array of learning and development opportunities, and demonstrating fairness in promotion and advancement decisions. These deeper leadership behaviors and cultural practices affect how Millennials feel about their place in the organization and how long they choose to stay.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For decades, Great Place to Work has shown the immense impact that a high-trust culture has on employee experience across all generations. No matter their age, employees tend to be more productive and engaged when they feel pride in their work, experience camaraderie with teammates, and work in an environment defined by trusting relationships.<\/p>\n<p>The difference with Millennials is the degree to which a high-trust culture impacts their experience and their intent to stay.<\/p>\n<p>We found that Millennials who say they have a great place to work are 20 times more likely than peers who do not have that experience to plan to stay with the company (compared to 15 times for Gen X and nine times for Boomers). In stark contrast to the popular image of the constantly job-hunting Millennial, 85% of Millennial front-line employees and 89% of Millennial managers at the Best Workplaces said they intend to stay with their companies for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>That 89% figure for Millennial managers is especially noteworthy. Unlike other generations, we found that Millennials tend to have less positive work experiences as they move up the ladder in an organization; Millennials in executive leadership roles not only reported lower scores than their Boomer and Gen X executive counterparts, they also fared worse than Millennials in front-line manager and department leader roles.<\/p>\n<p>This trend plays out in turnover stats as well, with Millennial managers twice the flight risk as Boomer managers.<\/p>\n<p>To solve this retention problem, the best companies look beyond trend-of-the-day perks and consider how to connect Millennials to the deeper meaning in their work. Our research shows that Millennials who found \u201cspecial meaning\u201d in their work were six times more likely to plan to stay at their workplaces.<\/p>\n<p>But what does that mean for organizations without obvious social missions? Are certain industries at an inherent disadvantage in competing for and retaining the best Millennial talent?<\/p>\n<p>In studying the Best Workplaces for Millennials, we found leading employers use different \u201cmeaning archetypes\u201d to help employees connect to their work and feel part of something significant. For example, they might identify as an industry disruptor that inspires innovation, or declare giving back a key part of their organizational culture. Others honed in on their service-oriented focus, their unwavering team support for employees in times of need, or their reputation as industry leaders offering superior products and expertise.<\/p>\n<p>Across all these archetypes, employers we studied focused on helping align the employee\u2019s personal values and the organization\u2019s work. This approach turns work into an opportunity for employees to meaningfully express who they are as individuals\u2014or even an opportunity for their organizations to help them become the person they want to be.<\/p>\n<p>And while some of these archetypes easily lend themselves to a particular industry, outstanding companies aren\u2019t relying on a single avenue to meaning. Instead, they combine several archetypes to ensure as many employees as possible can find meaning in the workplace.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy doesn\u2019t work without clear communication and a true commitment from leadership. Inconsistency between an organization\u2019s stated and lived values will immediately undermine its leaders\u2019 trustworthiness. Millennials are especially sensitive to authenticity.<\/p>\n<p>But when company leaders do make the effort to connect with team members on a personal level, the results are astounding: Millennials who said managers take a sincere interest in them as people, and not just as employees, were eight times more likely to report workplace traits linked to innovation and organizational resilience.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s one reason <a href=\"http:\/\/reviews.greatplacetowork.com\/ultimate-software?utm_source=fortune&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=article&amp;utm_campaign=2017-millennials-list\">Ultimate Software<\/a>, the No. 1 company on the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/best-workplaces-millennials\/\">Best Workplaces for Millennials<\/a> list, flies every new employee to its Florida headquarters for a two-day orientation that includes a chance to meet the CEO. When they return, new hires plug in to a custom social network that not only shares company news but also connects co-workers to groups formed around shared hobbies and professional pursuits.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMillennials have a fraught reputation in the workplace,\u201d said Onyeagoro. \u201cYet the main generational difference boils down to higher expectations for the level of personal fulfillment and connection they want from work.

The report hopes to highlight the role such companies, and their investors, play in Climate Change.<\/p>\n<p>These companies, led by Saudi Aramco, Russian gas giant Gazprom, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/exxon-mobil\/\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil<\/a>, have produced about 923 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalents between 1988 to 2016. State-owned coal producers in China and India also feature in the top 10, as do Mexican oil producer Pemex and the National Iranian Oil Corporation. Of the top 10, only Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are majority-owned by private investors (although CDP has, for some reason, listed a bundle of privately-held companies into what it calls &#8220;Russia Coal&#8221; at no. 7).<\/p>\n<p>The burning of fossil fuels has increased by orders of magnitude in the last 30 years as China and India have joined the process of industrialization that the West started in the middle of the 18th century. More greenhouse gases were emitted from human activity in the last 30 years than in the previous 150, according to CDP&#8217;s research.<\/p>\n<p>Despite rapid growth in the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, companies and governments across the world are struggling to master the transition from fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Fossil fuel companies are also going to have to demonstrate leadership as part of this transition,&#8221; wrote Pedro Faria, technical director of the CDP. &#8220;They owe it to the millions of clients they serve that are already feeling the effects of climate change, and to the many millions more that require energy for the comfort of their daily lives but are looking for alternatives to their products.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Notably, <a

Some Democrats had accused Trump&#8217;s fellow Republicans of stalling the sanctions package at least until after that meeting, to please the president. Republicans denied that.<\/p>\n<p>House Republican leaders initially rejected the bill for procedural reasons, prompting the Senate to tweak it. But Democrats then objected to a change by the Senate that they said weakened the bill by making it more difficult for the House to vote on any change in sanctions policy by Trump.<\/p>\n<p>AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, said Democrats still were objecting to moving the bill in its current form.<\/p>\n<p>But both Republican and Democratic House aides said talks between the two parties were continuing and there was a decent chance for a quick compromise, more so because of the latest revelations about Trump&#8217;s eldest son.<\/p>\n<h2>&#8216;Certainly does not help&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>Donald Trump Jr. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/donald-trump-jr-russia-russian-lawyer-meeting\/\">eagerly agreed<\/a> last year to meet a woman <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-russia-meeting-natalia-veselnitskaya\/\">he believed<\/a> was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House nominee Hillary Clinton, as part of Moscow&#8217;s official support for his father, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton-russia\/\">emails released<\/a> on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It certainly does not help the administration at this point,&#8221; a senior Republican House aide said.<\/p>\n<p>Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, predicted that the matter would be cleared up quickly and brought to the floor for a vote this week.<\/p>\n<p>The Russia package, written as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill, puts into law sanctions previously established through presidential executive order, including some on Russian energy projects and debt financing.<\/p>\n<p>It also imposes sanctions on Russians convicted of human rights abuses or cyber attacks and would allow new sanctions on Russian mining, metals, shipping and railways.<\/p>\n<p>Trump administration officials have been meeting with lawmakers to argue against some parts of the bill, including the requirement that Trump obtain Congress&#8217; permission before easing any sanctions.<\/p>\n<p>They also objected to the fact that many of the sanctions are mandatory, meaning Trump could not waive them for national security reasons.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is more about foreign policy and having the flexibility to negotiate with other countries,&#8221; White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a daily briefing.<\/p>\n<p>But many of Trump&#8217;s fellow Republicans said they wanted to move ahead nonetheless to send a strong message to Russia.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Any administration would prefer to conduct foreign policy 100 percent without involvement by Congress. That&#8217;s just the way life is,&#8221; said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<\/p>\n<p>Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will introduce his own Russia sanctions legislation in the House if the Senate bill remains stalled, a source familiar with his thinking said.<\/p>\n<p>Royce&#8217;s thinking was first reported by Politico.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 01:52:45","updated":"2017-07-12 01:52:45","minute":"1:52 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-russia-lawyer-sanctions-bill-congress\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-russia-lawyer-sanctions-bill-congress\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-russia-lawyer-sanctions-bill-congress\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Trump Jr. Scandal 'Gives Urgency' to Russia Sanctions Bill","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"51\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5500835775001-51\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5500835775001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tGPUdx\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Ddonaldtrump%2Cdonaldtrumpjr%2Celection2016%2Chillaryclinton%2Cputin%2Crussia%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Ddonaldtrump&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>&#8220;It certainly does not help the administration at this point,&#8221;

Week","content":"<p>Do you drink multiple cups of coffee a day?<\/p>\n<p>If you do, two new, large studies suggest that you are more likely to live longer than those who don\u2019t. Together, the studies\u2014both published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine\u2014<\/em>tracked more than 700,000 participants for an average of around 16 years. Results were consistent: coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of early death, particularly from heart and gut disease.<\/p>\n<p>The first study, which comprised of around 186,000 Americans, found that participants who consumed two or more cups a day were 18% less likely to die by the study\u2019s close (this was after the authors controlled for diet, exercise, smoking, among other factors). In the second study, which examined coffee consumption among more than 520,000 Europeans from 10 countries, found a similar effect: coffee drinkers were less likely to die than non-coffee drinkers.<\/p>\n<p>Before you run to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/starbucks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks<\/a>, it\u2019s important to note that correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation. Yes, coffee drinkers were associated with lower degrees of premature death than non-coffee drinkers. But coffee wasn&#8217;t necessarily the differentiating factor that reduced the risk of premature death. The study didn\u2019t control for everything\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-40567047\">according to the BBC<\/a>, it did not consider socio-economic status or social habits, for example. Speaking with CNN, Marc Gunter, one of the European study\u2019s authors, floated the idea that coffee drinkers are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/10\/health\/coffee-leads-to-longer-life-studies-reaffirm\/index.html\">healthier to begin with<\/a>, as many people who avoid the drink do so because of existing health problems.<\/p>\n<p>Magical cure or no, the pair of studies should make coffee drinkers feel better about the habit.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy diet and lifestyle,&#8221; Veronica Wendy Setiawan, who led the European study, told CNN. &#8220;This study and the previous studies suggest that for a majority of people, there&#8217;s no long term harm from drinking coffee.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 03:06:02","updated":"2017-07-11 03:06:02","minute":"3:06 PM

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> launches its third annual shopping extravaganza known as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/amazon-prime-day-2017-how-to-track-deals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prime Day<\/a> on Monday night, rewarding customers who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00DBYBNEE\/ref=nav_prime_try_btn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">subscribe to its membership service<\/a> with extra discounts. Yet as shoppers scoop up the deals on July 11, when Prime Day officially begins, the best deal may be reserved for investors in Amazon stock.<\/p>\n<p>When the e-commerce company held its first Prime Day in July 2015, it marked a turning point for Amazon&#8217;s stock price: Over the past two years, Amazon stock has gained about 113% in value, while the wider stock market as measured by the S&amp;P 500 index <del><\/del>has gained just 15% during the same period.<\/p>\n<p>Still, there&#8217;s evidence that many people underestimated just how big an impact Prime Day would have on Amazon <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"amzn\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">amzn<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. While Twitter users <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/07\/15\/amazon-prime-day-deals-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">complained<\/a> that the company&#8217;s inaugural Prime Day was a failure, the numbers don&#8217;t lie: Amazon&#8217;s sales <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/07\/16\/amazon-prime-day-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rose an estimated 93%<\/a> in the United States alone compared to the same day of the week a year earlier, according to e-commerce company ChannelAdvisor. And in 2016, Amazon said Prime Day was its <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/07\/13\/prime-day-sales\/\">largest sales day ever<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So if investors believed that Amazon&#8217;s one-day deal bonanza, aimed at topping <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/01\/prime-day-better-black-friday\/\">Black Friday<\/a> holiday sales, was a positive sign of the company&#8217;s ambitions, how wealthy would they be if they invested just prior to that first Prime Day?<\/p>\n<p>The cost of an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00DBYBNEE\/ref=nav_prime_try_btn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">annual Amazon Prime membership<\/a> is about $100. If two years ago investors had put that amount into Amazon stock instead, their stake would now be worth $213.<\/p>\n<p>At the time, though, a single share of Amazon was worth about $465; today, Amazon&#8217;s stock price is about $990 a share. If an investor had decided to put the value of a nice home into the company, or about $500,000, ahead of the the first Prime Day, that stake would be worth about $1.1 million now.<\/p>\n\t\t<form id=\"wpcom-iframe-form-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a\" target=\"wpcom-iframe-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a\" method=\"post\" action=\"\/\/wpcomwidgets.com\/?wpcom_origin=https%3A%2F%2Ffortunedotcom.wordpress.com\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"width\" value=\"600\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"height\" value=\"600\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frameborder\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"style\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"class\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"scrolling\" value=\"no\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"mozallowfullscreen\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"resize\" value=\"0\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"replace_attributes\" value=\"1\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fallback\" value=\"&lt;p class=&quot;protected-embed-fallback&quot;&gt;This embed is invalid&lt;\/p&gt;\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_data\" value=\"PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9Ii8vZGF0YXdyYXBwZXIuZHdjZG4ubmV0L29TNVVkLzIvIiBzY3JvbGxpbmc9Im5vIiBmcmFtZWJvcmRlcj0iMCIgYWxsb3d0cmFuc3BhcmVuY3k9InRydWUiIGFsbG93ZnVsbHNjcmVlbj0iIiB3ZWJraXRhbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW49IndlYmtpdGFsbG93ZnVsbHNjcmVlbiIgbW96YWxsb3dmdWxsc2NyZWVuPSJtb3phbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW4iIG9hbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW49Im9hbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW4iIG1zYWxsb3dmdWxsc2NyZWVuPSJtc2FsbG93ZnVsbHNjcmVlbiIgd2lkdGg9IjYwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI2MDAiIGNsYXNzPSIiIHJlc2l6ZT0iMCIgcmVwbGFjZV9hdHRyaWJ1dGVzPSIxIj48L2lmcmFtZT4=,bdb5d47fca8aa55f6978c2857fb07fc42173bf1f\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_tag\" value=\"protected-iframe\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_hash\" value=\"b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595\" \/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/form>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<iframe\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname=\"wpcom-iframe-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a\"\n\t\t\tid=\"wpcom-iframe-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a\"\n\t\t\tframeborder=\"0\"\n\t\t\tscrolling=\"no\"\n\t\t\twidth=\"600\" \t\t\theight=\"600\" \t\t\twebkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen\t\t\tclass=\"wpcom-protected-iframe \"\n\t\t><\/iframe>\n\t\t\n\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t( function() {\n\t\t\tvar func = function() {\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe_form = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-form-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a');\n\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById('wpcom-iframe-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a');\n\t\t\t\tif ( iframe_form && iframe ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe_form.submit();\n\t\t\t\t\tiframe.onload = function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.contentWindow.postMessage( {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'msg_type': 'poll_size',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t'frame_id': 'wpcom-iframe-b5e83edfa568a7d48c4b6954707e8595-59661e9fd4c4a'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}, window.location.protocol + '\/\/wpcomwidgets.com' );\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\/\/ Autosize iframe\n\t\t\t\tvar funcSizeResponse = function( e ) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar origin = document.createElement( 'a' );\n\t\t\t\t\torigin.href = e.origin;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message origin\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'wpcomwidgets.com' !== origin.host )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\/\/ Verify message is in a format we expect\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( 'object' !== typeof e.data || undefined === e.data.msg_type )\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\n\t\t\t\t\tswitch ( e.data.msg_type ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcase 'poll_size:response':\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvar iframe = document.getElementById( e.data._request.frame_id );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.width )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.width = '100%';\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( iframe && '' === iframe.height )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiframe.height = parseInt( e.data.height );\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\tif ( 'function' === typeof window.addEventListener ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.addEventListener( 'message', funcSizeResponse, false );\n\t\t\t\t} else if ( 'function' === typeof window.attachEvent ) {\n\t\t\t\t\twindow.attachEvent( 'onmessage', funcSizeResponse );\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (document.readyState === 'complete') { func.apply();

Amazon&#8217;s stock is now worth 24 times what it was then. That means an investor who bought $100 of Amazon stock back then would now have $2,400, while the $500,000 investor would have a stake worth $12 million. An investor who bought Amazon stock even earlier at its IPO <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/15\/amazon-stock-20-years-ipo\/\">would be even wealthier<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the importance of Prime Day for investors likely has more to do with the new Prime members it attracts than the actual day itself. (Prime Day sales accounted for less than 1% of the company&#8217;s revenue last year, based on estimates <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/07\/13\/prime-day-sales\/\">from FBIC<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>To access the deals, consumers must sign up for a Prime membership, which they did in droves ahead of the company&#8217;s inaugural event: More people entered a trial membership then than they had on any other day in the program&#8217;s history, Amazon said at the time.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Amazon&#8217;s Prime users spend the most on the website, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). On average, Prime members spend about $1,300 each year compared to non-members spending about $700 per year. CIRP estimates that Amazon now touts about <a href=\"http:\/\/investorplace.com\/2017\/07\/amazon-prime-amazon-com-inc\/#.WWO9HtPytjQ\">85 million Prime members<\/a>, up 35% from a year earlier.<\/p>\n<p>If that trend continues, expect Amazon&#8217;s stock price to rise further.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 10, 2017","published":"2017-07-10 08:08:06","updated":"2017-07-10

In April, he <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/04\/08\/tidal-jay-z-spotify-apple\/\">pulled all of his albums from Spotify<\/a> leaving none of his work behind. The musician is part owner of Tidal and recruited other high-profile artists to join his efforts in allowing artists to maintain more control over their music and a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/03\/31\/jay-z-tidal\/?iid=sr-link4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher share of revenue.<\/a><\/p>\n<p align=\"center\"><em> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <em>Fortune\u2019s<\/em> technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Universal Music made a deal with Spotify to allow artists to regulate if their music will be premium-only content, but that did not appeal to Jay-Z.

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/att\/\" target=\"_blank\">AT&amp;T<\/a>, a leading opponent of the federal government&#8217;s 2015 net neutrality rules, said it would join an online protest this week in favor of keeping the rules.<\/p>\n<p>In recognition of the &#8220;Day of Action&#8221; on July 12, the company said it would display on its website banners in favor of maintaining a &#8220;free and open&#8221; Internet.

After courts had struck down two earlier attempts to protect online openness saying the agency lacked the authority, the FCC under Obama-appointee Tom Wheeler classified Internet service providers as &#8220;common carriers&#8221; much like phone carriers. The designation, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2016\/06\/14\/471286113\/u-s-appeals-court-holds-up-net-neutrality-rules-in-full\">satisfied the courts<\/a> but stoked fears among the companies that they could be subject to more regulation in the future, including price controls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Saddling modern broadband infrastructure and investment decisions with heavy-handed, outdated telephone regulations creates an environment of market uncertainty that does little to advance internet openness,&#8221; AT&amp;T&#8217;s Quinn wrote in his blog post. &#8220;Instead, it jeopardizes the prospects for continued innovation and robust growth we have witnessed since the internet\u2019s creation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But net neutrality supporter Greer pointed out that the rules needed a strong legal underpinning after lawsuits by Internet service providers cut down earlier attempts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous, and a blatant attempt to confuse the public, that they are claiming they are joining a grassroots online protest that&#8217;s explicitly intended to defend the Title II based net neutrality protections that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support,&#8221; Greer said.<\/p>\n<p>AT&amp;T was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/02\/fcc-verizon-att-net-neutrality\/\">under investigation<\/a> by the FCC last year for potentially violating the net neutrality rules, but Pai dismissed the probe. Staff at the agency had concluded that AT&amp;T <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"t\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/att\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">t<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> might be in violation because it allowed its wireless customers to watch as much streaming video from its DirecTV Now app as they wanted without counting against their monthly data limits.

A fuller picture of the meeting has emerged in recent days, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/10\/us\/politics\/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\"><em>Times<\/em> reporting on Monday<\/a> that prior to arranging the meeting with Veselnitskaya, whom Trump Jr. believed would offer him compromising information on Clinton, the younger Trump was &#8220;informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father\u2019s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of the email.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/gettheworldsmostpowerfulwomennewsletter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Subscribe<\/strong> to The World\u2019s Most Powerful Women,<\/a> Fortune\u2019s daily must-read for global businesswomen.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton,&#8221; Veselnitskaya told NBC. &#8220;It was never my intention to have that.\u201d She did say, however, that that&#8217;s what Trump Jr. was after. She told NBC that the one question he asked her was whether she had &#8220;any financial records which might prove that the funds used to sponsor the [Democratic National Convention] were coming from inappropriate sources.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>When pressed by NBC&#8217;s Keir Simmons on why Trump Jr. had the impression that she possessed any compromising materials, Veselnitskaya said: \u201cIt is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.\u201d The meeting lasted between 20 and 30 minutes, according to Veselnitskaya, who also told NBC that the president&#8217;s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump&#8217;s campaign chairman at the time Paul Manafort attended the sit-down but did not actively participate in the discussion.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"59\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5497947372001-59\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5497947372001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2u4jA5v\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dcybersecurity%2Cdonaldtrump%2Cleadership%2Crussia%2Cvladimirputin%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Ddonaldtrump&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>Veselnitskaya says she took the meeting to press a client&#8217;s interest in overturning the Magnitsky Act, which U.S. Congress passed in 2012 to impose sanctions against anyone implicated in the torture of Sergei Magnitsky, who was arrested\u2014and later died\u2014in Russia after accusing officials there of $230 million in tax fraud.

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> has been rumored for months to be working on a new, virtual version of its iPhone fingerprint sensor. But now it&#8217;s working against the clock to get the feature to work.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking to sources within Apple&#8217;s supply chain, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves told investors on Monday that Apple is still having trouble getting its fingerprint sensor to work inside the upcoming iPhone 8&#8217;s display. According to the analyst, whose comments were earlier <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/apple-has-just-weeks-to-fix-its-fingerprint-problem-says-keybanc-1499694018\">reported<\/a> on by <em>Barron&#8217;s<\/em>, Apple has just a few weeks to fix the problem or face the possibility of an iPhone delay.<\/p>\n<p>Apple is rumored to be planning a major new handset release this year, believed to be known as the iPhone 8. The device will reportedly come with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen and a revamped, all-glass design. It could sit alongside modest updates to last year&#8217;s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets, rumored to be known as the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s technology newsletter<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If Apple indeed releases the iPhone 8 this year, it <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/06\/apple-2018-iphone-oled\/\">would be the first handset ever released<\/a> by the company to offer OLED screen technology. What&#8217;s more, Apple is rumored to be planning a design that would eliminate the iPhone 8&#8217;s physical home button and instead cover the smartphone&#8217;s face with the OLED display.<\/p>\n<p>Several reports have said that Apple <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> wants to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/29\/iphone-10th-anniversary-rumors\/\">move the &#8220;Touch ID&#8221; fingerprint sensor from the physical home button<\/a> to inside the screen. Users would then hold their fingers on the display to unlock it and authorize payments through the company&#8217;s mobile-payment platform Apple Pay. No physical button would be required.<\/p>\n<p>Apple rival Samsung <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"SSNLF\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ssnlf\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">SSNLF<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> said earlier this year that it was testing virtual fingerprint technology, but ultimately couldn&#8217;t get it to work in its flagship handset, the Galaxy S8. Samsung was rumored to be planning the feature for this summer&#8217;s Galaxy Note 8, but again, reportedly couldn&#8217;t get it to work properly.<\/p>\n<p>If Hargreaves&#8217; sources are correct, Apple might be suffering from the same problems with the iPhone 8. And he says that the company will need to get it working by August to ensure its suppliers have enough time to get enough units ready for an iPhone 8 release sometime in October or November.<\/p>\n<p>If Apple can&#8217;t fix the problem, the analyst wrote, Apple could be forced to push back the iPhone 8&#8217;s launch or ditch a fingerprint sensor altogether\u2014something the company wouldn&#8217;t want to do. Apple would replace it with a facial-scanning feature that would authenticate users before they can access the smartphone&#8217;s software.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This option appears increasingly likely as time passes, but is far from ideal,&#8221; Hargreaves wrote to investors, according to <em>Barron&#8217;s<\/em>. &#8220;We believe Apple\u2019s facial recognition solution should work from many angles and in low-light environments. However, it would not work without clear line of sight to the user&#8217;s face.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 8 at a press event in September. It&#8217;s now becoming increasingly unlikely the smartphone will be available to consumers anytime before October.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11

company and line of work. Some require background checks. Some conduct drug tests. Others facilitate a skills test. But for some job candidates of Spanish airline Iberia, they were asked to complete a particularly unusual task ahead of employment: a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/19\/bluetooth-pregnancy-test\/\">pregnancy test<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Iberia required candidates to pass a number of tests before receiving a job offer, including a medical examination, which additionally meant a pregnancy test for women interviewing for positions with the airline, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/11\/business\/spain-iberia-women-pregnancy.html?smid=tw-nytimesbusiness&amp;smtyp=cur\"><em>New York<\/em> <em>Times<\/em><\/a>. Both government and union officials were quick to condemn the airline, with officials in the Balearic Islands issuing Iberia a 25,000 euro ($28,000) fine.<\/p>\n<p>After being fined, Iberia said in a <a href=\"http:\/\/grupo.iberia.es\/portal\/site\/WebCorporativa\/menuitem.abb717cb888166100cd0cbfdf34e51ca?ib_contentId=688dbc1f9992d510VgnVCM2000008ee815acRCRD\">statement<\/a> this week that it would no longer require candidates to take a pregnancy test. The airline also said it would not appeal the fine.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will continue to put all necessary measures to ensure that pregnant women work with all the guarantees and maximum safety, as we have done so far,&#8221; the statement reads in translated English. &#8220;This is an exemplary enterprise in the implementation of policies that facilitate women&#8217;s access to employment.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Iberia, which is part of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/17\/2-flight-attendants-say-frontier-airlines-wouldnt-let-them-breast-feed-on-duty\/\">International Airlines Group<\/a> \u2014 one of the largest airline companies in the world that oversees British Airways and Aer Lingus, as well \u2014 said that it has &#8220;never stopped hiring a woman due to the fact of being pregnant, if it fulfilled the requirements demanded for the position.&#8221; The airline said that it interviewed six pregnant women last year and hired all but one due to a failed plane-driving test. And the 32 pregnant flight attendants the airline reassigned to different positions in the past was out of safety concerns.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi, Alex.

In 2011 he cofounded a startup, BitInstant, that became one of the biggest early cryptocurrency companies. At one point, it was processing about a third of all Bitcoin transactions, before flaming out in 2013. \u201cYou talk to 10 people,\u201d says Shrem, \u201cI guarantee you at least seven of them will say they got their first bitcoin from BitInstant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem is a natural-born impresario, a promoter\u2019s promoter, and he was one of the first public faces of the cryptocurrency phenomenon. In 2013, when <i>GQ<\/i> needed a \u201cspirit guide\u201d to the shadow realm of digital currency, it relied on Charlie Shrem. He was featured in the documentary <i>The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.<\/i> He was a speaker and proselytizer at industry conferences. And he cofounded the Bitcoin Foundation, the first nonprofit advocacy group for digital currency.<\/p>\n<p>But Shrem crashed as fast as he rose. In March 2015 he <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/03\/30\/bitcoins-criminal-prison-shrem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">went to federal prison after pleading guilty<\/a> to helping a customer acquire Bitcoins to resell on the underground marketplace Silk Road, where Bitcoin was used to buy drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Today Shrem is a free man again, and his world has dramatically changed. Bitcoin was the only digital currency when he was first in the game. Now it\u2019s less important\u2014not because it has imploded, as critics long predicted it would, but because it has given rise to hundreds of new digital assets.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071462\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_crypto_marketshares\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900\" data-orig-size=\"1220,1072\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_crypto_marketshares\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart compares cryptocurrencies market share in 20016 and 2017&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071462\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&amp;h=900 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=150&amp;h=132 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=300&amp;h=264 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=768&amp;h=675 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart compares cryptocurrencies market share in 20016 and 2017<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He is embracing the transformation.

He has already stumbled once in his comeback, with one venture crashing almost instantly, before landing a job at Jaxx, a startup that allows users to hold separate balances of different virtual coins in digital wallets.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem embodied the chaotic, legally questionable early days of cryptocurrency. But he says he\u2019s different now. He claims he\u2019s no longer operating mainly for himself and instead wants to use his talents to strengthen the crypto-community.<\/p>\n<p>Charlie Shrem is nobody\u2019s image of a traditional financier, but that\u2019s precisely the point with alternative currencies: Their early leaders were the sorts of people who would never pass muster at, say, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a>. That may just make Shrem the perfect messenger, as digital currencies transition from an off-the-grid form of exchange favored by people who reviled any established system into something that is fast becoming an established system of its own.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The promise of bitcoin, when it came into the world in 2009, was to be a universal currency, electronic cash that could be sent around the globe in minutes and that would work as well in New Delhi as it did in New York. Its scarcity is predetermined by the code: New bitcoins are introduced into the system at regular intervals through a process called mining. The word is misleading, since this form of mining consists of solving the complex math problems necessary to confirm transactions on the network. Successfully solving the problems triggers the creation of more digital currency.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, built a decentralized system that no one would own but anyone could participate in. A constantly updated copy of the ledger recording all Bitcoin transactions\u2014the blockchain\u2014would be stored on the computer of anyone running the software. Although the ledger was open to all, Bitcoin transactions were meant to be anonymous.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is groundbreaking because it allows transactions to be processed without recourse to a central authority, such as a payments company, government, or bank. Businesses and services can be decentralized, cutting out costly middlemen and removing single points of failure.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071463\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_cryptocurrencies\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391\" data-orig-size=\"1220,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_cryptocurrencies\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows change in prices for top cryptocurrencies&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071463\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&amp;h=391 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=150&amp;h=57 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=300&amp;h=115 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=768&amp;h=293 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart shows change in prices for top cryptocurrencies<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But only eight years after its launch, Bitcoin is showing strain. A civil war has been raging over its future. Due to limitations in its code, the Bitcoin network can process only seven transactions a second\u2014a trifling quantity for any system that aspires to serve the masses. (Visa handles thousands of transactions per second.) As the load has increased, the time it takes to confirm transactions has risen sharply, and users have been at odds over how to solve the problem. The bickering threatens to divide the currency into two competing versions of Bitcoin\u2014or condemn it to obsolescence.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is Bitcoin slower than some of its younger rivals, it\u2019s also more limited. Yes, Bitcoin allows the transfer of value. But many of the new systems can be used for much more. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/ethereum-blockchain-vitalik-buterin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum\u2019s creators<\/a>, for instance, have built a potentially more versatile network by incorporating a scripting language that allows developers to create \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014agreements written into the software that can dispense funds and perform other functions automatically in response to preset triggers.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means Bitcoin faces a threat from younger, more nimble rivals. Their names are legion: Litecoin. Zcash. Monero. Dash.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Dash\u2014a portmanteau of \u201cdigital cash\u201d\u2014is one of the biggest. It got its start in January 2014, one of many cryptocurrencies that emerged following Bitcoin\u2019s then-immense rise in price. Many of these, known as \u201caltcoins,\u201d were used exclusively as vehicles for pump-and-dump schemes. Somebody\u2014often an altcoin\u2019s creator\u2014would pick a coin to pour funds into, and hype would build. Novices would pile in, the price would spike, and the major investors would dump it, sending the price plunging downward.<\/p>\n<p>The old Charlie Shrem was not above taking advantage. He claims he turned $50 into $15,000 on one altcoin (but also got badly burned on an altcoin intended to be a national cryptocurrency for Iceland, which shed half of its value in a single day).<\/p>\n<p>Dash was one of the most popular altcoins. Originally known as Darkcoin because it promised untraceable transactions, it saw plenty of pumping and dumping. But its creator continued to refine the software and add new features. In March 2015 it rebranded as Dash, so people wouldn\u2019t mistake it for a \u201csingle-feature coin,\u201d says Ryan Taylor, who leads its core team. Gradually Dash gained legitimacy. The total value of its currency has grown at triple-digit rates every year. Part of that is due to Bitcoin\u2019s flaws. To attract customers, Taylor says, a new payment method needs to be faster, easier to use, and more secure than the alternatives. Bitcoin and most other digital currencies fail on all three metrics, he argues. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not faster or easier to use than credit cards,\u201d says Taylor, a former financial services consultant at McKinsey.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"64\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5460479898001-64\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5460479898001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tXJS5B\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbitcoin%2Cblockchain%2Ccryptocurrencies%2Cfinance%2Cico%2Cinitialcoinofferings%2Clitecoin%2Ctech%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>Dash has functions to address those weaknesses. It offers an \u201cinstant send\u201d feature that Taylor says is \u201cas fast as using a credit card.\u201d To protect against fraud or theft, Dash\u2019s next version\u2014due out this year\u2014will include features such as \u201cmoderated transactions,\u201d in which funds are released only upon the receipt of goods or services, and \u201cvault accounts,\u201d which give their owner 24 hours to stop an impending withdrawal of funds. The goal is to create a medium of exchange that can be used for everyday commerce.<\/p>\n<p>Dash\u2019s clearest innovation, though, may be its governance system. All prospective projects must be submitted for a vote by people who hold at least 1,000 coins. The advantage of such a system, according to Olaf Carlson-Wee, the CEO of Polychain Capital, a hedge fund that invests exclusively in blockchain assets, is that it allows a decentralized network to make decisions rapidly, avoiding the sort of conflict now engulfing Bitcoin, which has little structure and no way to compel anybody to, say, adopt a new version of its software.<\/p>\n<p>As Dash took off this spring, Shrem decided to get involved. He proposed creating a prepaid debit card. You\u2019d load in, say, three Dash coins, which would then be converted into dollars (or euros or whatever). The cardholder could then use the card at any business that accepts a debit card. This could open the floodgates for hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency to enter the mainstream economy. \u201cPeople only want to hold Dash if they can easily convert it to something of use,\u201d Taylor agrees.<\/p>\n<p>There are several Dash-funded debit cards available, but Shrem\u2019s would be the first that could be used in the U.S. His plan garnered overwhelming support within the Dash universe. \u201cReputation plays an important role on the network,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cWhen someone like Charlie comes along, people take it seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Charlie Shrem grew up in Sheepshead Bay, a predominantly Russian and Jewish neighborhood in deep Brooklyn. His parents are Orthodox Jews, and his father worked for a jewelry retailer, while his mother cared for Shrem and his two sisters.<\/p>\n<p>Shy and awkward, Shrem blossomed upon discovering a knack for computers. He taught himself to code and became a presence in online hacker forums. In 2009, while attending Brooklyn College, he cofounded a daily deals site for electronics called Daily Checkout. He found he loved sales.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem has claimed, with characteristic hyperbole, that he was one of the first 10 people in the world to know what Bitcoin was. That is likely exaggerated. By the fall of 2011, however, he was sufficiently established in the Bitcoin community to be credible as the CEO of a startup (albeit one he launched from his parents\u2019 basement).<\/p>\n<p>That startup, BitInstant, helped people acquire digital currency and move it between Bitcoin exchanges. Eventually it allowed customers to convert cash into <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/05\/18\/how-wall-street-got-into-the-wild-world-of-bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoins at banks<\/a> such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/wells-fargo\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wells Fargo<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"wfc\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/wells-fargo\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">wfc<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bank-of-america-corp\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"bac\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bank-of-america-corp\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">bac<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and (via partners including MoneyGram) at 700,000 locations across the U.S., Russia, and Brazil, including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart<\/a>, 7-Eleven, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cvs-health\/\" target=\"_blank\">CVS<\/a> stores.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2070320\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BIT.07.01.17.bit-instant\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2070320\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">BitInstant\u2019s brain trust in 2012 (from left): Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem, and Ira Miller.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Brian Patrick Eha<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Shrem, who was partnering with a 23-year-old Welsh coder named Gareth Nelson, handled the business end. He raised $10,000 from his mom and $120,000 from an angel investor named Roger Ver. But one person who declined to invest warned him that BitInstant had no safeguards to prevent money laundering.<\/p>\n<p>That was fine with Shrem. It was fine, too, with a substantial portion of BitInstant\u2019s clientele, users of Silk Road, who needed to exchange dollars for Bitcoins in order to buy drugs on the underground market. There was even a middleman, Robert Faiella, a plumber in Florida who had a sideline obtaining Bitcoins for Silk Road users.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem soon figured out what Faiella was up to. But rather than shut him down, Shrem helped Faiella source money for drug transactions. Bit\u00adInstant\u2019s cash-processing company and Shrem\u2019s partner wanted to put a stop to it. But Shrem simply encouraged Faiella to disguise his identity with a new username and email address.<\/p>\n<p>The flow of money went on unimpeded. By the time Shrem finally cut him off, in late 2012, Faiella\u2014who later pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and was sentenced to four years in prison\u2014had laundered nearly a million dollars through BitInstant.<\/p>\n<p>The libertarian defense for Shrem\u2019s conduct\u2014which he himself has advanced at times\u2014has two parts: first, that individuals have the right to do what they want with their money and their bodies as long as they aren\u2019t harming anyone else; second, that at the time he began helping Faiella, the U.S. government hadn\u2019t determined how to classify or regulate Bitcoin. If the government hadn\u2019t even decided whether it viewed Bitcoin as money, the argument goes, how could one be laundering it?<\/p>\n<p>The Bitcoin community in those days was united in its sense of righteous mission. Because the digital currency abjured central banks and other authorities, many of its first devotees were libertarians, anarchists, and black marketeers who wanted to do business away from the government\u2019s watchful eye. They were gleeful at any sign of Bitcoin\u2019s impending triumph over the financial system, enraged by any show of incompetence or malice by the government or big banks. The free flow of capital, community members believed, is a human right.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem embraced the outlaw stance. When a payment processor, under pressure from partner banks and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mastercard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastercard<\/a>, cut all ties with Bitcoin companies, leaving customer funds stranded, it was BitInstant that hacked together a solution to let them withdraw their money.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>By August 2012, when I first met him, Shrem was a 22-year-old CEO, a cocky, motormouthed capitalist and proud pothead. I interviewed him and his lieutenants in an office they dubbed the Bakery because of all the marijuana-fueled bull sessions that took place there after hours. One former employee, Rachel Yankelevitz, told me, \u201cCharlie\u2019s main qualification for coworkers was if they could smoke weed or drink with him and chill together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem had swaggering ambitions. His company would soon be processing 30% of all Bitcoin transactions, and he wanted BitInstant to become \u201cthe <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> of Bitcoin,\u201d as he told me at the time.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:280px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2070322\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376\" data-orig-size=\"1920,2581\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BIT.07.01.17.Charlie-Shrem.Vert\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376?w=223\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376?w=762\" class=\"wp-image-2070322\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&amp;h=376 280w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=560&amp;h=752 560w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=223&amp;h=300 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Shrem has claimed, with characteristic hyperbole, that he was one of the first 10 people in the world to know what Bitcoin was.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Jeffery Salter for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That fall, BitInstant raised $1.5 million in funding, most of it from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who had started a venture capital firm. They had become interested in digital currency, and BitInstant helped them buy their first bitcoins. The twins\u2014who later disavowed Shrem upon learning of his arrest\u2014would go on to scoop up a reported 1% of all the bitcoins in existence.<\/p>\n<p>After raising funds, BitInstant\u2019s future looked bright. Because so much of the crypto-economy depended on fast money transfers in and out of the system, Shrem\u2019s company became a barometer of the industry. During the Cypriot financial crisis in early 2013, when it appeared that the bank accounts of regular citizens would be taxed at 6.75% as a condition of a European bailout deal, Bitcoin suddenly looked like a safe haven, and its price shot up from $50 to $266\u2014a previously unimaginable high. Shrem became a millionaire almost overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Then the wheels came off. First a dispute with the investors led to the ouster of Shrem\u2019s two best friends at BitInstant. Something went out of him with their departures. He was often distracted. He\u2019d spend the night partying, then sleep in and show up late.<\/p>\n<p>The site, meanwhile, was straining under the surge in users, leading to waves of customer complaints. An upgrade to the platform became mired in technical problems and legal concerns. It became clear BitInstant had been operating without state money transmitter licenses (which, it became clear, some states would require to serve their residents), and the cost of obtaining them would be prohibitive.<\/p>\n<p>It was all too much. BitInstant shut down in July 2013. Alex Waters, the company\u2019s chief information officer, says Shrem \u201csquandered\u201d the opportunity to make BitInstant a world-beating company and \u201cscrewed over a lot of people.\u201d Customers were irate.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem himself appeared at first to have gotten away unscathed. He was living on his own and enjoying his freedom. He and his girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e), Courtney Warner, took a vacation to Morocco, where he says he tried opium. He flew to Argentina on a mission for the Bitcoin Foundation. His life was a whirlwind of partying and dealmaking. \u201cI have to take a lot of people out to clubs, buying bottles, buying dinners,\u201d he told a reporter in late 2013. His business now was not BitInstant but himself. He began to earn speaking fees\u2014and all the while he kept talking like BitInstant was going to be rebuilt better than ever. \u201cHe was very arrogant,\u201d Warner says of her fianc\u00e9 during that time.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2014 it all caught up with him. On his way back from a speech in Amsterdam, he was arrested. He eventually pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitter, and was sentenced to two years. \u201cI screwed up,\u201d he told the judge at his sentencing. Shrem had wanted to raise the issue of whether the law he had broken was just. But his lawyers discouraged it.<\/p>\n<p>Other Bitcoiners had run afoul of the law, but Shrem was the first to serve time. This fact makes him, depending on your view, either a criminal who got his just deserts or a martyr. \u201cA lot of people say that I took the first shot for Bitcoin,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cThe first person to walk through the door always gets shot, and then everyone else can come through.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Shrem entered prison in March 2015. He had put weight on his slight 5-foot-4 frame, medicating himself with vodka in the nervous months before he was incarcer\u00adated. Now, in the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lewisburg, Pa., he detoxed and began frequenting the prison library. He found himself pondering the question of value. What made currencies\u2014of any form\u2014worth anything? As luck would have it, the prison economy provided the answer.<\/p>\n<p>The prison had its own currency, one based on protein\u2014mainly packets of mackerel in soybean oil. \u201cGood-quality protein is very hard to come by in prison,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cTuna is good, but tuna doesn\u2019t have texture. Mackerel is meaty.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Inmates serving long sentences, he says, would stockpile mackerel, using it as a store of value, like a savings account. But those pouches of mackerel expire in three years. \u201cPeople started transacting these mackerels that were expired,\u201d Shrem explains. \u201cThey called them money macks. The money mack had a value of about a dollar, whereas eating macks had a value of about $1.50. And they had exchangers. The money macks had no value\u2014except that everyone said they had value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gradually he came to believe, as some monetary theorists do, that the acceptance of certain forms of money\u2014shells, colored beads, pieces of paper\u2014is largely a social convention, dependent upon what technologists would call their network effect.<\/p>\n<p>But it was clear that certain features could make one type of currency more suitable than another. Money macks were an ideal form of money for inmates. \u201cThey were scarce,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cThe only way you could get money mackerels was from edible mackerels that expired. And the inflation rate of edible mackerels was set. You had 500 inmates\u2014every inmate could only buy 14 mackerels every week in the commissary\u2009\u2026\u2009That\u2019s how many mackerels at any time, at maximum, could come into the system. There\u2019s no arbitrary printing of mackerels; there\u2019s no flooding of the market with this food. It\u2019s like Bitcoin. There was no Federal Reserve of mackerel that was printing whenever they wanted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin, he knew, has qualities that make it a powerful currency, store of value, and payments network. But expecting it to do more than that was asking too much, he decided. \u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s going to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cTrying to do smart contracts, and social media, and a distributed file-storage system, and all these different things on top of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014it\u2019s like trying to have your browser do everything for you.\u201d Better to let a thousand crypto-flowers bloom, each one focusing on what it does best.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><b><\/b>Many of the hottest blockchain assets today are not digital currencies like Bitcoin or Dash, but so-called tokens, distinguished from true cryptocurrencies by their lack of a blockchain. They run instead on existing blockchains, primarily Ethereum\u2019s, and tend to be built for specific applications, such as a peer-to-peer marketplace for computation (Golem), a crowdsourced prediction market (Augur), or a blockchain-based advertising platform (Brave).<\/p>\n<p>Where digital currencies are generally \u201cmined,\u201d tokens are usually distributed in crowd sales known as initial coin offerings (ICOs). (After that, they trade on public exchanges.) These crowd sales serve both to raise funds and to give potential investors their first chance to grab a piece of whatever service is being built. Dozens of ICOs have already been launched, raising more than $230 million last year, followed by more than $450\u202fmillion just in the first half of 2017. (For more on investing in tokens, and their uncertain legal status, see \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/ico-initial-coin-offering-investing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Tech Investors Love ICOs\u2014and Lawyers Don&#8217;t<\/a>.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>The tokenization craze constitutes nothing less than \u201cthe second business model of the Internet,\u201d contends Carlson-Wee, whose hedge fund is backed by Andreessen Horowitz. Imagine if <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> had issued a token to its users, with its value deriving from the content and connections generated on the social network. Early users might have scooped up large quantities of the token at rock-bottom prices, while those who joined later, as the network\u2019s value became widely apparent, might find themselves able to afford only a few. But all of them, by holding this digital asset, would be able to participate in Facebook\u2019s growing success.<\/p>\n<p>This, of course, is not the case. The $435 billion value of Facebook is shared only among Mark Zuckerberg and other stockholders. Most other Internet platforms operate on the same principle. Their owners extract massive value from interactions between users.<\/p>\n<p>With blockchain-based systems, by contrast, \u201cthere\u2019s no longer a division between users and owners,\u201d Carlson-Wee says. The tokens are a wealth-sharing mechanism, a way that everyone from hedge funders to consumers can take positions in\u2014and place bets on\u2014the future of the Internet.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Shrem\u2019s reentry into civilian life was a two-step process. He was transferred to a halfway house in Harrisburg, Pa., in March 2016. Shrem says living not merely with embezzlers, fraudsters, and drug dealers, as he had in Lewisburg, but also with \u201cmurderers, bank robbers, child molesters\u201d was worse than prison. He cried his first night there. During this time, Shrem worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant for $8 an hour. Gainful employment was a condition of residency at the halfway house. Playing around with magical Internet money didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cThey were very specific,\u201d Shrem says.<\/p>\n<p>If being a dishwasher humbled him, it was still more humbling to realize how much the Bitcoin community had changed in his absence. Familiar landmarks were gone. When he tried to visit one of his old haunts, an online exchange where he\u2019d once speculated in altcoins, he found the site no longer existed. Even the lingo had changed.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem set about catching up on what he\u2019d missed. In prison the library had been his sanctuary: He would stay in there for hours. He says he read 137 books while incarcerated. Now he took the same approach with the blockchain industry. Marco Santori, a cryptocurrency attorney at the law firm Cooley, likens Shrem\u2019s reeducation to \u201cthat scene in<i> Austin Powers<\/i> where he\u2019s unfrozen after 40 years or whatever it is, and he just watches 40 years of history straight through to try to get his bearings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t stop Shrem from stumbling out of the gate. Having seen that token sales were the new frontier, he became the chief technology officer of a startup called Intellisys Capital, which he predicted was going to revolutionize the investment world. The idea was to raise funds for a portfolio of middle-market companies\u2014and, later, blockchain startups\u2014by issuing $25 million worth of tokens in an ICO. \u201cIt seemed like a really cool idea,\u201d Shrem says.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was that their token would almost certainly be classified as a security under U.S. law. To avoid legal trouble, Intellisys decided to bar American and British citizens from participating in the sale. But the plan had drawbacks: They would have to rely on partners to vet prospective investors for them.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem became the face of the venture. He was back in pitch mode, touting Intellisys to the press and the public. He described the fund\u2019s planned first investment, a 20-year-old waste-\u00admanagement company in Michigan, as a \u201cproof of concept.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But as the date of the token sale was pushed back, from mid-January to the end of February, Shrem began to get cold feet. Selling a security could bring all kinds of scrutiny to a man already convicted of a financial crime. \u201cI still get these nightmares I\u2019m in prison sometimes,\u201d he tells me in March. He was becoming increasingly nervous.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately for him, fate intervened. The ICO, held at the end of February, was a bomb. \u201cWe had a bunch of technical problems,\u201d says Shrem. \u201cWe raised a few hundred thousand dollars, and then we refunded everyone\u2019s money.\u201d Shrem decided to walk away. It was easier to take the hit to his reputation than live in fear.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>That\u2019s one of the paradoxes of cryptocurrency: Each new development seems to bring both great promise and great peril. ICOs are the next big chapter, after crowdfunding, in the democratization and decentralization of finance, says Brock Pierce, a co-founder of a San Francisco venture capital firm, Blockchain Capital, that invests in cryptocurrency startups. His firm recently raised $10 million by issuing its own blockchain token, becoming the first venture capital firm in the world to do so. (The token sold out in six hours.)<\/p>\n<p>But many of the ICOs conducted so far have played fast and loose with regulations, he says, operating in a gray area. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that people are going about doing it,\u201d says Pierce. That the SEC hasn\u2019t yet cracked down means nothing, he says. \u201cGood entrepreneurs with the best of intentions, who want to innovate and change the world, are going to end up in jail\u2014or with fines.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem agrees. \u201cI try to explain to people that in any other industry it\u2019s okay to try new things and break shit, but in fintech, because you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s money, it\u2019s a lot more difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially in the Bitcoin and blockchain space. The government is always watching.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now, though, the ICO market is surging\u2014despite fears of a bubble and scams\u2014and mainstream investors are entering. In May, billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, long bullish on Bitcoin, announced that he would take part in an ICO for the first time. The crowd sale, planned for July, is for the token powering Tezos, a smart-contracts platform that Draper says will be \u201cmore secure and more democratic\u201d than Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>Draper says he expects in the future to see tokens for \u201ceverything from health care to insurance to commodities.\u201d Tokens, he says, are both \u201ca brave new frontier\u201d and a \u201cWild West.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The failure of Intellisys cost Shrem. \u201cI expended social capital on it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to get that back.\u201d In March he tells me that he wants to make a comeback, but it has to be the right sort of comeback. \u201cI need to show that I didn\u2019t just get lucky one time\u201d with BitInstant, he says, \u201cbut that I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He had moved to Sarasota with his fianc\u00e9e and was living with her and his future mother-in-law in a rented pink townhouse. He was spending his abundant off-hours relaxing on the beach, eating in nice restaurants, boating, Jet Skiing. He was mellower and more patient than in the past. He decided that if an opportunity came to get in on the ground floor of \u201csomething amazing,\u201d he would seize it. That turned out to be a full-time job as Jaxx\u2019s head of business and community development. The company\u2019s values appealed to him: Jaxx users are in control of their own funds. \u201cIt goes toward my vision of you being in control of your own money, you being in control of your own freedom,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>March was the first profitable month for Jaxx, which lets users (now more than 100,000) exchange one virtual coin for another. Now its founder, Anthony Di Iorio, who cofounded Ether\u00adeum, wants to expand to other countries, such as China, and Shrem will be a key part of that process. He is in charge of turning relationships into revenue, working with developers to add their cryptocoins to Jaxx\u2019s stable. Dozens of new partnerships are in the works.<\/p>\n<p>But they have to be the right coins. Having helped Bitcoin grow from a stripling to a giant, Shrem is confident he can tell which crypto-projects have real promise\u2014and which don\u2019t. He thinks if he can help build Jaxx, he\u2019ll \u201cbe a major industry player again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His timing may be good. According to Carlson-Wee, \u201cthe real Cambrian explosion of tokenized assets\u201d is still a couple of years away. That\u2019s when he expects to see technology that would let Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and other blockchain networks communicate. As it stands, they\u2019re isolated from one another. (The concept has spawned another name in the argot: \u201cparachains,\u201d a reference to the idea of bringing parallel blockchains together.)<\/p>\n<p>Parachains would allow applications and smart contracts built on one system to interact with another system\u2019s assets. An Ethereum smart contract could be triggered by the balance in a Bitcoin wallet address, for instance. This would help overcome the network effect of the oldest cryptocurrency. Just as Bitcoin faces an uphill battle against currencies like the U.S. dollar, so new cryptocurrencies are at a disadvantage to Bitcoin, which has the broadest name recognition and biggest user base.<\/p>\n<p>Forging bonds between blockchains would allow users to flow easily from Bitcoin to Dash to Ethereum to Zcash, strengthening the entire ecosystem and making all of it more valuable. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re keyed into any cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll have access to every cryptocurrency,\u201d Carlson-Wee says.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin was created to be the money of the Internet. Its successors may build a new kind of Internet, a Web 3.0 of interconnected blockchains running countless applications. Charlie Shrem is determined to be in the middle of it all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Brian Patrick Eha is the author of <\/span><\/em><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/178074658X\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fortune028-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=178074658X&amp;linkId=753b01ca9fca2275daa3485bb3fb060d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2017 issue of Fortune.

In the brief time since, Francis has electrified the church and attracted legions of non-Catholic admirers by energetically setting a new direction. He has refused to occupy the palatial papal apartments, has washed the feet of a female Muslim prisoner, is driven around Rome in a Ford Focus, and famously asked \"Who am I to judge?\" with regard to the church's view of gay members. He created a group of eight cardinals to advise him on reform, which a church historian calls the \"most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries.\" Francis recently asked the world to stop the rock-star treatment. He knows that while revolutionary, his actions so far have mostly reflected a new tone and intentions. His hardest work lies ahead. And yet signs of a \"Francis effect\" abound: In a poll in March, one in four Catholics said they'd increased their charitable giving to the poor this year.

Existing backers that also participated in the round include <\/span><span class=\"s1\">Summit Partners, KKR, and TenEleven Ventures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Darktrace has raised a total of $180.5 million to date.<\/p>\n<p>Among Darktrace&#8217;s investors is Invoke Capital, the U.K.-based venture capital fund created by tech veteran <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/10\/01\/mike-lynch-sues-hp\/\">Mike Lynch<\/a>, who sold the business software firm <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/14\/hewlett-packard-autonomy\/\">Autonomy<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/hp\/\" target=\"_blank\">HP<\/a> for $11 billion in 2011. HP later marked down the price of its acquisition by $8.8 billion, and Lynch and HP have been embroiled in heated legal battles ever since.<\/p>\n<p class=\"column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/pages.email.fortune.com\/newsletters\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Although Darktrace would not disclose its revenues, the company said the value of its customer contracts has reached $200 million, increasing 140% between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017. A big chunk of that growth is attributable to Darktrace&#8217;s expansion within the United States where, the company says, sales tripled in the past year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We saw sales for autonomous response&#8221;\u2014a feature that takes automatic action to slow or stop the spread of digital attacks\u2014&#8221;take off since <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/4783910\/why-a-global-cyber-crisis-stalled-this-time\/\">WannaCry<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/27\/petya-ransomware-ukraine-medoc\/\">NotPetya<\/a>,&#8221; said Nicole Eagan, Darktrace cofounder and CEO, on a call with <em>Fortune<\/em><i>, <\/i>referring to two destructive ransomware attacks that have recently infected business networks worldwide. The automatic response feature, which Eagan referenced and which Darktrace debuted earlier this year, is called &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/darktrace-machine-learning-security\">Antigena<\/a>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Orders started coming in quite rapidly when those attacks happened,&#8221; Eagan said.<\/p>\n<p>Darktrace has 1,000 customers for its cybersecurity product, called Enterprise Immune System, with a quarter of them in financial services, about 15% in telecom and technology, and 12% in industrial systems. The rest are in sectors such as retail, travel, and government. Competitors include Vectra Networks, Palo Alto Networks&#8217; Light Cyber, and Deep Instinct as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#8217;s ArcSight and RSA&#8217;s Security Analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Darktrace is one among many cybersecurity startups now vying, alongside more established tech companies, to protect businesses from an onslaught of escalating computer threats. In order to succeed, the company must stay a step ahead of attackers and continue to gain adoption while displacing incumbents.<\/p>\n<p>Cybercrime cost the global economy an estimated $450 billion in 2016, as <i>Fortune<\/i> noted in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/amp.timeinc.net\/fortune\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/%3Fsource%3Ddam\">July cover story on hacking<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Darktrace&#8217;s headcount has doubled to 500 people in the past year. Eagan said she planned to put the new round of funding primarily toward hiring sales and marketing staff to continue the company&#8217;s growth in the Americas and Asia.<\/p>\n<p>Given the uptick in global cyber attacks\u2014WannaCry and NotPetya among them\u2014one can expect the threats to keep on coming.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 10, 2017","published":"2017-07-10

Rollout","content":"<p>Ahead of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/07\/elon-musk-tesla-model-3\/\">Model 3&#8217;s delivery rollout<\/a>, Tesla has announced a worldwide expansion to its customer service with the addition of 100 service centers, 350 repair vans and 1,400 technicians to support the broadened operation.<\/p>\n<p>The electric automaker based its expansion on a map of Model 3 reservation holders to identify where new service centers are most needed, the company said Tuesday. With up to 40 new repair lanes that do not require vehicle lifts, Tesla said the new centers will allow technicians to operate four times faster than traditional repair shops while using three times as less space.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla owners can also receive support on the road. The expanded van fleet can meet drivers at home, work or out and about as long as the location is relatively accessible, the company said. Similar to the service centers&#8217; new lanes, Tesla vans typically don&#8217;t require vehicle lifts to do repairs, which cost the same from the mobile fleet as they do in Tesla&#8217;s stationary centers. The company is hopeful the vans will streamline the repair process and remove 80% of the volume from its service centers.<\/p>\n<p>The key to Tesla&#8217;s customer service expansion is the vehicles&#8217; internal technology, which allows owners to run diagnostics on their cars without ever stepping foot in a repair shop or needing a van to come assist them. Most issues \u2014 Tesla estimates bout 90% \u2014 can be identified and diagnosed remotely, giving repair shops time to order replacement parts in advance or let users schedule appointments straight from their vehicle&#8217;s dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Elon Musk on Sunday <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/09\/tesla-model-3-pictures\/\">tweeted images<\/a> of the very first production version of Tesla&#8217;s new mass-market electric car, the Model 3, which is expected to start being delivered later this month.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"

In 2011 he cofounded a startup, BitInstant, that became one of the biggest early cryptocurrency companies. At one point, it was processing about a third of all Bitcoin transactions, before flaming out in 2013. \u201cYou talk to 10 people,\u201d says Shrem, \u201cI guarantee you at least seven of them will say they got their first bitcoin from BitInstant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem is a natural-born impresario, a promoter\u2019s promoter, and he was one of the first public faces of the cryptocurrency phenomenon.

He was featured in the documentary <i>The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.<\/i> He was a speaker and proselytizer at industry conferences.

Bitcoin was the only digital currency when he was first in the game. Now it\u2019s less important\u2014not because it has imploded, as critics long predicted it would, but because it has given rise to hundreds of new digital assets.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071462\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_crypto_marketshares\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900\" data-orig-size=\"1220,1072\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_crypto_marketshares\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart compares cryptocurrencies market share in 20016 and 2017&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071462\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&#038;h=900\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=1024&amp;h=900 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=150&amp;h=132 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=300&amp;h=264 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png?w=768&amp;h=675 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_crypto_marketshares.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart compares cryptocurrencies market share in 20016 and 2017<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He is embracing the transformation.

He has already stumbled once in his comeback, with one venture crashing almost instantly, before landing a job at Jaxx, a startup that allows users to hold separate balances of different virtual coins in digital wallets.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem embodied the chaotic, legally questionable early days of cryptocurrency. But he says he\u2019s different now.

That may just make Shrem the perfect messenger, as digital currencies transition from an off-the-grid form of exchange favored by people who reviled any established system into something that is fast becoming an established system of its own.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The promise of bitcoin, when it came into the world in 2009, was to be a universal currency, electronic cash that could be sent around the globe in minutes and that would work as well in New Delhi as it did in New York. Its scarcity is predetermined by the code: New bitcoins are introduced into the system at regular intervals through a process called mining. The word is misleading, since this form of mining consists of solving the complex math problems necessary to confirm transactions on the network. Successfully solving the problems triggers the creation of more digital currency.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, built a decentralized system that no one would own but anyone could participate in. A constantly updated copy of the ledger recording all Bitcoin transactions\u2014the blockchain\u2014would be stored on the computer of anyone running the software. Although the ledger was open to all, Bitcoin transactions were meant to be anonymous.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is groundbreaking because it allows transactions to be processed without recourse to a central authority, such as a payments company, government, or bank. Businesses and services can be decentralized, cutting out costly middlemen and removing single points of failure.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071463\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_cryptocurrencies\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391\" data-orig-size=\"1220,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_cryptocurrencies\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows change in prices for top cryptocurrencies&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071463\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&amp;h=391 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=150&amp;h=57 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=300&amp;h=115 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=768&amp;h=293 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart shows change in prices for top cryptocurrencies<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But only eight years after its launch, Bitcoin is showing strain. A civil war has been raging over its future. Due to limitations in its code, the Bitcoin network can process only seven transactions a second\u2014a trifling quantity for any system that aspires to serve the masses. (Visa handles thousands of transactions per second.) As the load has increased, the time it takes to confirm transactions has risen sharply, and users have been at odds over how to solve the problem. The bickering threatens to divide the currency into two competing versions of Bitcoin\u2014or condemn it to obsolescence.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is Bitcoin slower than some of its younger rivals, it\u2019s also more limited. Yes, Bitcoin allows the transfer of value. But many of the new systems can be used for much more. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/ethereum-blockchain-vitalik-buterin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum\u2019s creators<\/a>, for instance, have built a potentially more versatile network by incorporating a scripting language that allows developers to create \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014agreements written into the software that can dispense funds and perform other functions automatically in response to preset triggers.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means Bitcoin faces a threat from younger, more nimble rivals. Their names are legion: Litecoin. Zcash. Monero. Dash.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Dash\u2014a portmanteau of \u201cdigital cash\u201d\u2014is one of the biggest. It got its start in January 2014, one of many cryptocurrencies that emerged following Bitcoin\u2019s then-immense rise in price. Many of these, known as \u201caltcoins,\u201d were used exclusively as vehicles for pump-and-dump schemes. Somebody\u2014often an altcoin\u2019s creator\u2014would pick a coin to pour funds into, and hype would build. Novices would pile in, the price would spike, and the major investors would dump it, sending the price plunging downward.<\/p>\n<p>The old Charlie Shrem was not above taking advantage. He claims he turned $50 into $15,000 on one altcoin (but also got badly burned on an altcoin intended to be a national cryptocurrency for Iceland, which shed half of its value in a single day).<\/p>\n<p>Dash was one of the most popular altcoins. Originally known as Darkcoin because it promised untraceable transactions, it saw plenty of pumping and dumping. But its creator continued to refine the software and add new features. In March 2015 it rebranded as Dash, so people wouldn\u2019t mistake it for a \u201csingle-feature coin,\u201d says Ryan Taylor, who leads its core team. Gradually Dash gained legitimacy. The total value of its currency has grown at triple-digit rates every year. Part of that is due to Bitcoin\u2019s flaws. To attract customers, Taylor says, a new payment method needs to be faster, easier to use, and more secure than the alternatives. Bitcoin and most other digital currencies fail on all three metrics, he argues. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not faster or easier to use than credit cards,\u201d says Taylor, a former financial services consultant at McKinsey.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"9\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5460479898001-9\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5460479898001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tXJS5B\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbitcoin%2Cblockchain%2Ccryptocurrencies%2Cfinance%2Cico%2Cinitialcoinofferings%2Clitecoin%2Ctech%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>Dash has functions to address those weaknesses. It offers an \u201cinstant send\u201d feature that Taylor says is \u201cas fast as using a credit card.\u201d To protect against fraud or theft, Dash\u2019s next version\u2014due out this year\u2014will include features such as \u201cmoderated transactions,\u201d in which funds are released only upon the receipt of goods or services, and \u201cvault accounts,\u201d which give their owner 24 hours to stop an impending withdrawal of funds. The goal is to create a medium of exchange that can be used for everyday commerce.<\/p>\n<p>Dash\u2019s clearest innovation, though, may be its governance system. All prospective projects must be submitted for a vote by people who hold at least 1,000 coins. The advantage of such a system, according to Olaf Carlson-Wee, the CEO of Polychain Capital, a hedge fund that invests exclusively in blockchain assets, is that it allows a decentralized network to make decisions rapidly, avoiding the sort of conflict now engulfing Bitcoin, which has little structure and no way to compel anybody to, say, adopt a new version of its software.<\/p>\n<p>As Dash took off this spring, Shrem decided to get involved. He proposed creating a prepaid debit card. You\u2019d load in, say, three Dash coins, which would then be converted into dollars (or euros or whatever). The cardholder could then use the card at any business that accepts a debit card. This could open the floodgates for hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency to enter the mainstream economy. \u201cPeople only want to hold Dash if they can easily convert it to something of use,\u201d Taylor agrees.<\/p>\n<p>There are several Dash-funded debit cards available, but Shrem\u2019s would be the first that could be used in the U.S. His plan garnered overwhelming support within the Dash universe. \u201cReputation plays an important role on the network,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cWhen someone like Charlie comes along, people take it seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Charlie Shrem grew up in Sheepshead Bay, a predominantly Russian and Jewish neighborhood in deep Brooklyn. His parents are Orthodox Jews, and his father worked for a jewelry retailer, while his mother cared for Shrem and his two sisters.<\/p>\n<p>Shy and awkward, Shrem blossomed upon discovering a knack for computers. He taught himself to code and became a presence in online hacker forums. In 2009, while attending Brooklyn College, he cofounded a daily deals site for electronics called Daily Checkout. He found he loved sales.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem has claimed, with characteristic hyperbole, that he was one of the first 10 people in the world to know what Bitcoin was. That is likely exaggerated. By the fall of 2011, however, he was sufficiently established in the Bitcoin community to be credible as the CEO of a startup (albeit one he launched from his parents\u2019 basement).<\/p>\n<p>That startup, BitInstant, helped people acquire digital currency and move it between Bitcoin exchanges. Eventually it allowed customers to convert cash into <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/05\/18\/how-wall-street-got-into-the-wild-world-of-bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoins at banks<\/a> such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/wells-fargo\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wells Fargo<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"wfc\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/wells-fargo\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">wfc<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bank-of-america-corp\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"bac\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/bank-of-america-corp\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">bac<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>, and (via partners including MoneyGram) at 700,000 locations across the U.S., Russia, and Brazil, including <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart<\/a>, 7-Eleven, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cvs-health\/\" target=\"_blank\">CVS<\/a> stores.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2070320\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BIT.07.01.17.bit-instant\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2070320\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-bit-instanta.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">BitInstant\u2019s brain trust in 2012 (from left): Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem, and Ira Miller.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Brian Patrick Eha<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Shrem, who was partnering with a 23-year-old Welsh coder named Gareth Nelson, handled the business end. He raised $10,000 from his mom and $120,000 from an angel investor named Roger Ver. But one person who declined to invest warned him that BitInstant had no safeguards to prevent money laundering.<\/p>\n<p>That was fine with Shrem. It was fine, too, with a substantial portion of BitInstant\u2019s clientele, users of Silk Road, who needed to exchange dollars for Bitcoins in order to buy drugs on the underground market. There was even a middleman, Robert Faiella, a plumber in Florida who had a sideline obtaining Bitcoins for Silk Road users.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem soon figured out what Faiella was up to. But rather than shut him down, Shrem helped Faiella source money for drug transactions. Bit\u00adInstant\u2019s cash-processing company and Shrem\u2019s partner wanted to put a stop to it. But Shrem simply encouraged Faiella to disguise his identity with a new username and email address.<\/p>\n<p>The flow of money went on unimpeded. By the time Shrem finally cut him off, in late 2012, Faiella\u2014who later pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and was sentenced to four years in prison\u2014had laundered nearly a million dollars through BitInstant.<\/p>\n<p>The libertarian defense for Shrem\u2019s conduct\u2014which he himself has advanced at times\u2014has two parts: first, that individuals have the right to do what they want with their money and their bodies as long as they aren\u2019t harming anyone else; second, that at the time he began helping Faiella, the U.S. government hadn\u2019t determined how to classify or regulate Bitcoin. If the government hadn\u2019t even decided whether it viewed Bitcoin as money, the argument goes, how could one be laundering it?<\/p>\n<p>The Bitcoin community in those days was united in its sense of righteous mission. Because the digital currency abjured central banks and other authorities, many of its first devotees were libertarians, anarchists, and black marketeers who wanted to do business away from the government\u2019s watchful eye. They were gleeful at any sign of Bitcoin\u2019s impending triumph over the financial system, enraged by any show of incompetence or malice by the government or big banks. The free flow of capital, community members believed, is a human right.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem embraced the outlaw stance. When a payment processor, under pressure from partner banks and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mastercard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastercard<\/a>, cut all ties with Bitcoin companies, leaving customer funds stranded, it was BitInstant that hacked together a solution to let them withdraw their money.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>By August 2012, when I first met him, Shrem was a 22-year-old CEO, a cocky, motormouthed capitalist and proud pothead. I interviewed him and his lieutenants in an office they dubbed the Bakery because of all the marijuana-fueled bull sessions that took place there after hours. One former employee, Rachel Yankelevitz, told me, \u201cCharlie\u2019s main qualification for coworkers was if they could smoke weed or drink with him and chill together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem had swaggering ambitions. His company would soon be processing 30% of all Bitcoin transactions, and he wanted BitInstant to become \u201cthe <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> of Bitcoin,\u201d as he told me at the time.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:280px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2070322\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376\" data-orig-size=\"1920,2581\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BIT.07.01.17.Charlie-Shrem.Vert\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376?w=223\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376?w=762\" class=\"wp-image-2070322\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&amp;h=376 280w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=560&amp;h=752 560w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=223&amp;h=300 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Shrem has claimed, with characteristic hyperbole, that he was one of the first 10 people in the world to know what Bitcoin was.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Jeffery Salter for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That fall, BitInstant raised $1.5 million in funding, most of it from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who had started a venture capital firm. They had become interested in digital currency, and BitInstant helped them buy their first bitcoins. The twins\u2014who later disavowed Shrem upon learning of his arrest\u2014would go on to scoop up a reported 1% of all the bitcoins in existence.<\/p>\n<p>After raising funds, BitInstant\u2019s future looked bright. Because so much of the crypto-economy depended on fast money transfers in and out of the system, Shrem\u2019s company became a barometer of the industry. During the Cypriot financial crisis in early 2013, when it appeared that the bank accounts of regular citizens would be taxed at 6.75% as a condition of a European bailout deal, Bitcoin suddenly looked like a safe haven, and its price shot up from $50 to $266\u2014a previously unimaginable high. Shrem became a millionaire almost overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Then the wheels came off. First a dispute with the investors led to the ouster of Shrem\u2019s two best friends at BitInstant. Something went out of him with their departures. He was often distracted. He\u2019d spend the night partying, then sleep in and show up late.<\/p>\n<p>The site, meanwhile, was straining under the surge in users, leading to waves of customer complaints. An upgrade to the platform became mired in technical problems and legal concerns. It became clear BitInstant had been operating without state money transmitter licenses (which, it became clear, some states would require to serve their residents), and the cost of obtaining them would be prohibitive.<\/p>\n<p>It was all too much. BitInstant shut down in July 2013. Alex Waters, the company\u2019s chief information officer, says Shrem \u201csquandered\u201d the opportunity to make BitInstant a world-beating company and \u201cscrewed over a lot of people.\u201d Customers were irate.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem himself appeared at first to have gotten away unscathed. He was living on his own and enjoying his freedom. He and his girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e), Courtney Warner, took a vacation to Morocco, where he says he tried opium. He flew to Argentina on a mission for the Bitcoin Foundation. His life was a whirlwind of partying and dealmaking. \u201cI have to take a lot of people out to clubs, buying bottles, buying dinners,\u201d he told a reporter in late 2013. His business now was not BitInstant but himself. He began to earn speaking fees\u2014and all the while he kept talking like BitInstant was going to be rebuilt better than ever. \u201cHe was very arrogant,\u201d Warner says of her fianc\u00e9 during that time.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2014 it all caught up with him. On his way back from a speech in Amsterdam, he was arrested. He eventually pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitter, and was sentenced to two years. \u201cI screwed up,\u201d he told the judge at his sentencing. Shrem had wanted to raise the issue of whether the law he had broken was just. But his lawyers discouraged it.<\/p>\n<p>Other Bitcoiners had run afoul of the law, but Shrem was the first to serve time. This fact makes him, depending on your view, either a criminal who got his just deserts or a martyr. \u201cA lot of people say that I took the first shot for Bitcoin,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cThe first person to walk through the door always gets shot, and then everyone else can come through.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Shrem entered prison in March 2015. He had put weight on his slight 5-foot-4 frame, medicating himself with vodka in the nervous months before he was incarcer\u00adated. Now, in the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lewisburg, Pa., he detoxed and began frequenting the prison library. He found himself pondering the question of value. What made currencies\u2014of any form\u2014worth anything? As luck would have it, the prison economy provided the answer.<\/p>\n<p>The prison had its own currency, one based on protein\u2014mainly packets of mackerel in soybean oil. \u201cGood-quality protein is very hard to come by in prison,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cTuna is good, but tuna doesn\u2019t have texture. Mackerel is meaty.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Inmates serving long sentences, he says, would stockpile mackerel, using it as a store of value, like a savings account. But those pouches of mackerel expire in three years. \u201cPeople started transacting these mackerels that were expired,\u201d Shrem explains. \u201cThey called them money macks. The money mack had a value of about a dollar, whereas eating macks had a value of about $1.50. And they had exchangers. The money macks had no value\u2014except that everyone said they had value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gradually he came to believe, as some monetary theorists do, that the acceptance of certain forms of money\u2014shells, colored beads, pieces of paper\u2014is largely a social convention, dependent upon what technologists would call their network effect.<\/p>\n<p>But it was clear that certain features could make one type of currency more suitable than another. Money macks were an ideal form of money for inmates. \u201cThey were scarce,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cThe only way you could get money mackerels was from edible mackerels that expired. And the inflation rate of edible mackerels was set. You had 500 inmates\u2014every inmate could only buy 14 mackerels every week in the commissary\u2009\u2026\u2009That\u2019s how many mackerels at any time, at maximum, could come into the system. There\u2019s no arbitrary printing of mackerels; there\u2019s no flooding of the market with this food. It\u2019s like Bitcoin. There was no Federal Reserve of mackerel that was printing whenever they wanted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin, he knew, has qualities that make it a powerful currency, store of value, and payments network. But expecting it to do more than that was asking too much, he decided. \u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s going to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cTrying to do smart contracts, and social media, and a distributed file-storage system, and all these different things on top of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014it\u2019s like trying to have your browser do everything for you.\u201d Better to let a thousand crypto-flowers bloom, each one focusing on what it does best.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><b><\/b>Many of the hottest blockchain assets today are not digital currencies like Bitcoin or Dash, but so-called tokens, distinguished from true cryptocurrencies by their lack of a blockchain. They run instead on existing blockchains, primarily Ethereum\u2019s, and tend to be built for specific applications, such as a peer-to-peer marketplace for computation (Golem), a crowdsourced prediction market (Augur), or a blockchain-based advertising platform (Brave).<\/p>\n<p>Where digital currencies are generally \u201cmined,\u201d tokens are usually distributed in crowd sales known as initial coin offerings (ICOs). (After that, they trade on public exchanges.) These crowd sales serve both to raise funds and to give potential investors their first chance to grab a piece of whatever service is being built. Dozens of ICOs have already been launched, raising more than $230 million last year, followed by more than $450\u202fmillion just in the first half of 2017. (For more on investing in tokens, and their uncertain legal status, see \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/ico-initial-coin-offering-investing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Tech Investors Love ICOs\u2014and Lawyers Don&#8217;t<\/a>.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>The tokenization craze constitutes nothing less than \u201cthe second business model of the Internet,\u201d contends Carlson-Wee, whose hedge fund is backed by Andreessen Horowitz. Imagine if <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> had issued a token to its users, with its value deriving from the content and connections generated on the social network. Early users might have scooped up large quantities of the token at rock-bottom prices, while those who joined later, as the network\u2019s value became widely apparent, might find themselves able to afford only a few. But all of them, by holding this digital asset, would be able to participate in Facebook\u2019s growing success.<\/p>\n<p>This, of course, is not the case. The $435 billion value of Facebook is shared only among Mark Zuckerberg and other stockholders. Most other Internet platforms operate on the same principle. Their owners extract massive value from interactions between users.<\/p>\n<p>With blockchain-based systems, by contrast, \u201cthere\u2019s no longer a division between users and owners,\u201d Carlson-Wee says. The tokens are a wealth-sharing mechanism, a way that everyone from hedge funders to consumers can take positions in\u2014and place bets on\u2014the future of the Internet.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Shrem\u2019s reentry into civilian life was a two-step process. He was transferred to a halfway house in Harrisburg, Pa., in March 2016. Shrem says living not merely with embezzlers, fraudsters, and drug dealers, as he had in Lewisburg, but also with \u201cmurderers, bank robbers, child molesters\u201d was worse than prison. He cried his first night there. During this time, Shrem worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant for $8 an hour. Gainful employment was a condition of residency at the halfway house. Playing around with magical Internet money didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cThey were very specific,\u201d Shrem says.<\/p>\n<p>If being a dishwasher humbled him, it was still more humbling to realize how much the Bitcoin community had changed in his absence. Familiar landmarks were gone. When he tried to visit one of his old haunts, an online exchange where he\u2019d once speculated in altcoins, he found the site no longer existed. Even the lingo had changed.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem set about catching up on what he\u2019d missed. In prison the library had been his sanctuary: He would stay in there for hours. He says he read 137 books while incarcerated. Now he took the same approach with the blockchain industry. Marco Santori, a cryptocurrency attorney at the law firm Cooley, likens Shrem\u2019s reeducation to \u201cthat scene in<i> Austin Powers<\/i> where he\u2019s unfrozen after 40 years or whatever it is, and he just watches 40 years of history straight through to try to get his bearings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t stop Shrem from stumbling out of the gate. Having seen that token sales were the new frontier, he became the chief technology officer of a startup called Intellisys Capital, which he predicted was going to revolutionize the investment world. The idea was to raise funds for a portfolio of middle-market companies\u2014and, later, blockchain startups\u2014by issuing $25 million worth of tokens in an ICO. \u201cIt seemed like a really cool idea,\u201d Shrem says.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was that their token would almost certainly be classified as a security under U.S. law. To avoid legal trouble, Intellisys decided to bar American and British citizens from participating in the sale. But the plan had drawbacks: They would have to rely on partners to vet prospective investors for them.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem became the face of the venture. He was back in pitch mode, touting Intellisys to the press and the public. He described the fund\u2019s planned first investment, a 20-year-old waste-\u00admanagement company in Michigan, as a \u201cproof of concept.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But as the date of the token sale was pushed back, from mid-January to the end of February, Shrem began to get cold feet. Selling a security could bring all kinds of scrutiny to a man already convicted of a financial crime. \u201cI still get these nightmares I\u2019m in prison sometimes,\u201d he tells me in March. He was becoming increasingly nervous.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately for him, fate intervened. The ICO, held at the end of February, was a bomb. \u201cWe had a bunch of technical problems,\u201d says Shrem. \u201cWe raised a few hundred thousand dollars, and then we refunded everyone\u2019s money.\u201d Shrem decided to walk away. It was easier to take the hit to his reputation than live in fear.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>That\u2019s one of the paradoxes of cryptocurrency: Each new development seems to bring both great promise and great peril. ICOs are the next big chapter, after crowdfunding, in the democratization and decentralization of finance, says Brock Pierce, a co-founder of a San Francisco venture capital firm, Blockchain Capital, that invests in cryptocurrency startups. His firm recently raised $10 million by issuing its own blockchain token, becoming the first venture capital firm in the world to do so. (The token sold out in six hours.)<\/p>\n<p>But many of the ICOs conducted so far have played fast and loose with regulations, he says, operating in a gray area. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that people are going about doing it,\u201d says Pierce. That the SEC hasn\u2019t yet cracked down means nothing, he says. \u201cGood entrepreneurs with the best of intentions, who want to innovate and change the world, are going to end up in jail\u2014or with fines.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem agrees. \u201cI try to explain to people that in any other industry it\u2019s okay to try new things and break shit, but in fintech, because you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s money, it\u2019s a lot more difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially in the Bitcoin and blockchain space. The government is always watching.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now, though, the ICO market is surging\u2014despite fears of a bubble and scams\u2014and mainstream investors are entering. In May, billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, long bullish on Bitcoin, announced that he would take part in an ICO for the first time. The crowd sale, planned for July, is for the token powering Tezos, a smart-contracts platform that Draper says will be \u201cmore secure and more democratic\u201d than Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>Draper says he expects in the future to see tokens for \u201ceverything from health care to insurance to commodities.\u201d Tokens, he says, are both \u201ca brave new frontier\u201d and a \u201cWild West.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The failure of Intellisys cost Shrem. \u201cI expended social capital on it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to get that back.\u201d In March he tells me that he wants to make a comeback, but it has to be the right sort of comeback. \u201cI need to show that I didn\u2019t just get lucky one time\u201d with BitInstant, he says, \u201cbut that I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He had moved to Sarasota with his fianc\u00e9e and was living with her and his future mother-in-law in a rented pink townhouse. He was spending his abundant off-hours relaxing on the beach, eating in nice restaurants, boating, Jet Skiing. He was mellower and more patient than in the past. He decided that if an opportunity came to get in on the ground floor of \u201csomething amazing,\u201d he would seize it. That turned out to be a full-time job as Jaxx\u2019s head of business and community development. The company\u2019s values appealed to him: Jaxx users are in control of their own funds. \u201cIt goes toward my vision of you being in control of your own money, you being in control of your own freedom,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>March was the first profitable month for Jaxx, which lets users (now more than 100,000) exchange one virtual coin for another. Now its founder, Anthony Di Iorio, who cofounded Ether\u00adeum, wants to expand to other countries, such as China, and Shrem will be a key part of that process. He is in charge of turning relationships into revenue, working with developers to add their cryptocoins to Jaxx\u2019s stable. Dozens of new partnerships are in the works.<\/p>\n<p>But they have to be the right coins. Having helped Bitcoin grow from a stripling to a giant, Shrem is confident he can tell which crypto-projects have real promise\u2014and which don\u2019t. He thinks if he can help build Jaxx, he\u2019ll \u201cbe a major industry player again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His timing may be good. According to Carlson-Wee, \u201cthe real Cambrian explosion of tokenized assets\u201d is still a couple of years away. That\u2019s when he expects to see technology that would let Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and other blockchain networks communicate. As it stands, they\u2019re isolated from one another. (The concept has spawned another name in the argot: \u201cparachains,\u201d a reference to the idea of bringing parallel blockchains together.)<\/p>\n<p>Parachains would allow applications and smart contracts built on one system to interact with another system\u2019s assets. An Ethereum smart contract could be triggered by the balance in a Bitcoin wallet address, for instance. This would help overcome the network effect of the oldest cryptocurrency. Just as Bitcoin faces an uphill battle against currencies like the U.S. dollar, so new cryptocurrencies are at a disadvantage to Bitcoin, which has the broadest name recognition and biggest user base.<\/p>\n<p>Forging bonds between blockchains would allow users to flow easily from Bitcoin to Dash to Ethereum to Zcash, strengthening the entire ecosystem and making all of it more valuable. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re keyed into any cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll have access to every cryptocurrency,\u201d Carlson-Wee says.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin was created to be the money of the Internet. Its successors may build a new kind of Internet, a Web 3.0 of interconnected blockchains running countless applications. Charlie Shrem is determined to be in the middle of it all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Brian Patrick Eha is the author of <\/span><\/em><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/178074658X\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fortune028-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=178074658X&amp;linkId=753b01ca9fca2275daa3485bb3fb060d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2017 issue of Fortune.

And it has caught almost everyone by surprise. As recently as last summer, the narrative had been that Tesla just didn\u2019t get China. The automaker was on track for its third consecutive year of weak sales. The few consumers who knew about Teslas didn\u2019t know how to recharge one; those who preordered had faced delivery delays and iffy service. What\u2019s more, Tesla lacked the joint-venture partners that helped other foreign carmakers break into China\u2019s market. Michael Dunne, who runs independent advisory Dunne Automotive in Hong Kong, wrote a column in September predicting Elon Musk would reach Mars before cracking China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Today, Dunne is cheerfully sheepish about that column, and other naysayers are equally befuddled. There\u2019s no single explanation for Tesla\u2019s breakthrough. Sales got a lift from the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/02\/02\/tesla-model-x-china\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introduction of the Model X<\/a>, a luxury SUV for an SUV-mad country. The company also benefited from a critical mass of charging stations; from its direct-sales model, in a country where buyers feel fleeced by dealerships; and from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/04\/27\/elon-musk-china-tesla\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CEO Elon Musk\u2019s celebrity among the technorati<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">But chummy government relations also matter in a country where the state exerts enormous economic control, and Tesla\u2019s technology just happens to align perfectly with government priorities. Cofounder Martin Eberhard has said Tesla was started to fight climate change. Nowhere is the climate fight more important than in China, the world\u2019s largest spewer of greenhouse gases, which is in the midst of an unprecedented promotion of electric cars: Last year, sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in China rose 50% to 507,000, more than three times the U.S. figure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048100\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes_car_sales\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239\" data-orig-size=\"610,239\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tes_car_sales\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Graphic shows number of cars sold in China and the U.S., and the share of electric vehicles&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239?w=610\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2048100 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png 610w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=150&amp;h=59 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=300&amp;h=118 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The government estimates that as many as 7 million electric cars could be sold in China annually by 2025. It sees them as a way not only to clear smoggy skies, but to hack into the top rankings of the global auto industry. In electric, Chinese companies don\u2019t have to match the quality of a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/ford-motor\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford<\/a> or Mercedes-Benz; they think they can quickly build a whole new car. \u201cFor electric vehicles in China, we have a new technology model every two years,\u201d says Dong Yang, a high-ranking Communist Party official at the China Association of Automotive Manufacturers, the auto lobby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Still, virtually all Chinese electric cars are low-cost, relatively low-performance ones, without the luxury trimmings and lightning-fast acceleration that Tesla owners fetishize. Government officials consider Tesla a role model for these Chinese brands, and they\u2019ve cheered the company from the sidelines. Today, a handful of Chinese companies and cities are feverishly courting Tesla for a joint venture, <i>Fortune<\/i> has learned, and Musk has said his company could begin building cars in China before the end of 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">A joint venture could turn Tesla\u2019s China growth stratospheric, because its current model of importing cars from California is costly. Chinese tariffs and taxes boost the price of Tesla\u2019s sedans and SUVs in the country by 50% compared with the U.S.; the Model S sedan starts at the equivalent of $105,000, and the Model X at $130,000. So even as Tesla woos middle-class buyers in the U.S. (the Model 3, due to arrive this fall, will start at about $35,000) buyers in China have mostly resembled Vanessa Zhu: wealthy drivers who view Teslas as luxury vehicles, or at least as the coolest new piece of tech since the iPhone. Most of Tesla\u2019s 2016 sales were concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, China\u2019s centers of capital and affluence.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047106\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.kiddie Tesla\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2047106 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920\" alt=\"\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A child steers a \u201cModel S for Kids\u201d (also battery-powered) at a Tesla event at a Beijing mall.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Even if Tesla doesn\u2019t become a mass-market brand, sales in China alone could soon climb to 100,000 a year, impacting Tesla as intensely as a new, 1.4-billion-person market would <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola<\/a>. \u201cI could see a future where Tesla is displacing a lot of those Audis and Mercedes-Benz that are everywhere on Chinese roads,\u201d says Dunne.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Not bad for a company that, until recently, was digging out from under past mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\">Tesla began taking preorders in China for the Model S in August 2013. The company didn\u2019t know exactly how much each car would cost, and deliveries were eight months away. But anticipation ran high. The combination of Musk\u2019s renown, stories comparing Tesla\u2019s acceleration to a Ferrari\u2019s, and intrigue over the new technology sent preorders above 5,000 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The hype was there, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/03\/10\/tesla-china-problem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">but the sales and support were not<\/a>. <\/span>The original head of Tesla\u2019s China business was Kingston Chang,<span class=\"s2\"> formerly of luxury automaker Bentley. Chang wanted to broadly expand Tesla\u2019s operations, including customer service centers, <\/span>public relations, and car-charging networks, according to tech <span class=\"s2\">news site PingWest. But Tesla headquarters told him to build a sales team first, betting that good marketing could bring in more revenue before more stores and charging stations were finished being built. Tesla opened just a single showroom in Beijing, opposite an American Apparel store in one of the city\u2019s glitziest malls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048099\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tesla_stats\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462\" data-orig-size=\"610,462\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tesla_stats\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Charts show Tesla car units sale and revenues&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462?w=610\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2048099 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png 610w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=300&amp;h=227 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Tesla\u2019s strategy shifted again after Veronica Wu came aboard in December 2013, after a successful stint in big enterprise and education sales for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> in China. At Tesla, she discussed adding traditional outlets like dealerships to the mix, similar to the way Apple had added retail channels in China. Though headquarters balked, Tesla in China was soon encouraging fleet sales orders of 100 or more cars from car-rental agencies and institutions, to jump-start demand. Staff, especially salespeople, soared from 10 employees to more than 100, and later to 600. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the same time, Tesla imposed rules that frustrated individual buyers. Before customers could order a car, Tesla required that they prove they had a parking spot and a home charger, to ensure a good experience. The company also required that buyers live in a city that had a Tesla service center\u2014even though, as of mid-2014, only Beijing and Shanghai had such centers. Some high-rise apartment managers, meanwhile, balked at having chargers installed in their buildings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The mismatch between Tesla\u2019s approach and customer demand created a big opportunity for gray-market resellers\u2014who bought in bulk and catered to buyers who didn\u2019t meet Tesla\u2019s criteria. The company had no official resellers, but the cars made their way to many, who sold in dealerships, car centers, and even on Alibaba\u2019s TMall for more than the same models cost on Tesla\u2019s website. \u201cThere were a lot more scalpers than we expected,\u201d Wu now says. Others questioned whether the company was really in the dark: \u201cMost \u2018fleet\u2019 sales were just a flimsy cover for sales to resellers,\u201d concluded Bertel Schmitt of Dailykanban.com, an auto industry site. It was all legal, but also a sign that Tesla had strayed from the high-touch sales approach it used elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Tesla\u2019s first China deliveries arrived in spring 2014; Wu later told Reuters that China sales could drive 35% of the company\u2019s growth. But that was already sounding fanciful. Tesla was hurriedly building customer-service centers, and customers outside of Beijing and Shanghai were told they wouldn\u2019t get their cars until those centers were finished. One buyer made national news when he smashed the windshield of his own Tesla, after it arrived months later than expected. Meanwhile, the Chinese press didn\u2019t shower Tesla with as much coverage as the West\u2019s did. As a result, most potential customers didn\u2019t know much about Tesla\u2019s product. Consumers didn\u2019t know they could charge their car at home every night like a cell phone; most thought they had to rely on the still-small Supercharger network.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047111\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.tianenman\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047111\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Mike Fan drives his Model X past Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.

About 4,700 cars had been shipped to China, but only 2,500 were sold and registered to drivers. (The company delivered 18,500 cars in the U.S. that year.) Publicly, Tesla blamed the gap on speculators who entered orders, then didn\u2019t buy the Teslas once they shipped. But several former employees say the real problem was the lack of customer support. Says Ricardo Reyes, Tesla\u2019s former communications chief: \u201cI think Tesla took for granted that they were just going to succeed in China.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By December 2014, both Chang and Wu had left Tesla. Tesla executives in California griped privately that China wasn\u2019t so unique that it demanded a different strategy. But not long afterward, the company began an apology tour that marked a turning point. On a frigid evening in January 2015, during the Detroit International Auto Show, Musk admitted China sales were \u201cunexpectedly weak.\u201d That spring, he traveled to China to meet with President Xi Jinping and other leaders, tweeting that he remained \u201cvery optimistic\u201d despite \u201cearlier mistakes.\u201d Reyes offered a mea culpa at the Shanghai auto show in spring 2015, the first Chinese motor show that Tesla bothered attending: \u201cI think we have been a little bit too impatient in the Chinese market.\u201d It was as contrite as the company would get\u2014and the news it was generating was about to get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">In 2015, Tom Zhu,<\/span> a respected engineer responsible for China\u2019s Supercharger network, became the top executive in the country. The company ended that year with a disappointing 3,700 cars sold, but there were slivers of optimism. For one thing, Tesla was building Supercharger locations in China at a faster pace than anywhere in the world, addressing consumers\u2019 \u201ccharge anxiety.\u201d About 120 Supercharger locations exist in China today, compared with 370 in the U.S., and Tesla says China will have more than 800 charging stations by the end of 2017.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047107\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-skyline\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.skyline\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047107\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Vanessa Zhu drives her Tesla Model X through the Central Business District in Beijing.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">Just as important: Word was getting out that buying a Tesla was easier than buying other luxury cars. In China, dealerships known as \u201c4S stores\u201d (for \u201cservice, spare parts, sale, and survey\u201d) largely corner the market for popular luxury brands like BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, and Mercedes-Benz. The stores inflate costs for consumers by tens of thousands of dollars with various vague fees. Tesla\u2019s direct-sales showrooms eschew that system. And while import tariffs increase their overall cost, Tesla otherwise prices its cars in China at the same level that it does in the U.S. after currency adjustments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Vanessa Zhu visited three other brands before she settled on her Model X. The Range Rover dealership asked for an additional 300,000 yuan ($45,000) as its standard fee, she says; Porsche told her she had to wait three months for its Cayenne SUV and required a 100,000-yuan delivery fee. Tesla in contrast, put her on a one-size-fits-all waiting list and didn\u2019t impose fees. \u201cIn China, a car is a symbol of your status, so most people don\u2019t care what you pay in terms of those extra fees,\u201d Zhu says. \u201cBut I do care. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tesla owners also found out they could beat China\u2019s bureaucracy in the license-plate game. China\u2019s local governments restrict the number of drivers on their clogged, polluted streets by controlling the number of plates issued. Drivers have to wait years to get one through a lottery system. (In early 2015, 6.2 million people applied for just 36,757 available Beijing plates.) And once drivers get a plate, they are barred from driving one day a week.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But plates for electric cars now fall under different rules, thanks to the government\u2019s push for electric vehicles. Beginning in 2014, Shanghai allowed electric-car drivers to get a license plate without facing a wait, a $12,000 plate fee, or driving restrictions. Other cities followed suit, and such policies became a boon for China\u2019s electric-car makers. Without them, \u201cthere\u2019s no possibility that private consumers would buy these vehicles,\u201d says Zhang Yong, deputy general manager at the electric-car offshoot of state-owned Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The policies were game changers for Tesla too. The first six cities in China to have exempted electric vehicles from license plate restrictions: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. The cities with the highest Tesla sales, according to Junheng Li of JL Warren Capital: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">While the policies helped sell Model S sedans, Tesla realized quickly that the Model X would be a much bigger story in China. China\u2019s obsession with SUVs is 10 years old and going strong. Their popularity stems from a variety of factors: Domestic \u00admakers produce good models; their seating can accommodate an entire extended family; they\u2019re widely believed to be safer; and their higher prices imbue status. German luxury-car maker Porsche\u2019s bestselling vehicle in China isn\u2019t a sports car but its Macan SUV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By 2015, SUV sales were the only growing part of the Chinese auto market; in the first half of 2016, SUVs accounted for 35% of passenger-vehicle sales. It\u2019s no coincidence, then, that a spike in Tesla sales coincides exactly with the first Model X deliveries in China, in June 2016. In the second half of last year, with the SUV available, Tesla notched 7,670 sales\u2014about three-quarters of its total for the year in China. Tesla\u2019s sales had finally caught up to its hype.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">Close government relations<\/span> <span class=\"s2\">are a must in China for foreign companies, and Tesla has carefully cultivated them. Like Apple, Tesla has created new businesses thanks to its demand for Chinese-made components, particularly its cars\u2019 giant touch screens. In 2015, Tom Zhu said Tesla would double its spending on Chinese-made parts, committing to buying $500 million worth of supplies from Chinese companies that year; such spending has likely only skyrocketed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The far bigger question mark is whether, and when, Tesla will announce plans for a factory in the country. Every car brand with significant China sales\u2014including luxury-auto makers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW\u2014runs a joint venture with a local partner. The government has required as much for decades. Imported cars face hefty fees, as Tesla owners are painfully aware. <\/span>A Model 3 sedan\u2019s $35,000 starting price <span class=\"s2\">in the U.S. becomes $50,000 in China after a 25% tariff and 17% value-added tax\u2014a heavy lift for a middle-class buyer. \u201cIf they don\u2019t announce plans for local production, they will struggle to sustain this performance,\u201d says Bill Russo, former head of Chrysler North East Asia and managing director of Gao Feng Advisory in Shanghai.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tesla remains cagey about what those plans could look like. Dong Yang, the auto lobby official, says several potential local partners are courting the company, and that multiple provinces and municipalities want Tesla to build a plant with them: \u201cThey all offer better and better options,\u201d Dong says. In May, Musk said Tesla would more clearly define its plans for China production by the end of this year; a spokesman declined to give further details.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Tesla Joins a Very Exclusive Club<\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">When <i>Fortune<\/i> introduced its list of the 500 largest U.S. companies by revenue, in 1955, it included five U.S. automakers.

If you build fewer than 100,000 vehicles a year, it doesn\u2019t make sense to manufacture in China, says Steve Man, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif., can churn out more than 500,000 vehicles annually. Even if it doubles China sales this year, Tesla will just pass 20,000 cars. It faces a catch-22: It won\u2019t sell cars at lower prices that drive sales if it doesn\u2019t produce them locally, but local production won\u2019t be economical until sales rise drastically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Intellectual property is a looming headache as well. Critics of Chinese business practices argue that Tesla faces certain IP theft as soon as it brings manufacturing into China. \u201cYes, some of its tech will be stolen,\u201d says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at University of California at Berkeley who studies China\u2019s auto market. But Chang adds that the danger inherent in that theft is overstated. \u201cJust stealing tech does not make [a rival] a competitor,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Today more than a dozen Chinese-backed manufacturers (many of them American startups that now have Chinese owners) are tripping over one another to promote their electric cars and acceleration times; Faraday Future, Karma Automotive, NextEV, and Future Mobility are but a few. But most are likely to be stuck in the concept or prototype phase for the next several years\u2014even as Teslas zip across China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s one reason Tesla may be able to reach an agreement to produce cars in the country on favorable terms. China lusts after Tesla\u2019s technology but also its management practices. And Tesla already offers its patents to anyone who asks\u2014making it highly plausible that Musk would agree to more information-sharing in return for a vastly expanded market for Tesla\u2019s cars.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047112\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.traditional gate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047112\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Mike Fan drives his Tesla Model X through an arch in a traditional &#8216;hutong&#8217; alley near Lama Temple in Beijing.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">One big Chinese corporate player seems to have no doubt about Tesla\u2019s prospects. In late March, Tencent, the politically connected technology giant that recently became one of the world\u2019s 10 largest publicly traded companies, said it spent $1.8 billion buying Tesla stock. Not long afterward, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization edged past that of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/general-motors\/\" target=\"_blank\">General Motors<\/a>, making it the most valuable American automaker.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">On a recent<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> Sunday night, three dozen prospective buyers gather in a Tesla showroom in Beijing for a wine tasting. The crowd of mostly thirtysomethings skews wealthy, and cares some about the environment, but they\u2019re mostly in awe of the brand. Tesla\u2019s buyers\u2019 circle has expanded to include the rich along with the very rich. Jeff Yu, whose family runs a yogurt business, thought about buying an SUV from Mercedes-Benz or Maserati, but was put off by their glitz. \u201cTesla is a tech thing.

On Tesla\u2019s website, he\u2019s customized his Model X\u2014color: ocean blue\u2014for a total cost of 1.2 million yuan ($175,000).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">A waiter refills Qu\u2019s glass as a promotional video on a loop in the background underscores his aspirations. <i>Choose a Tesla green vehicle<\/i>, it says, over and over, <i>to advance a better life in the future<\/i>.\u2002<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the year in which Studebaker stopped making cars in the U.S., and stated incorrectly that the company had gone bankrupt in the 1960s.  <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the June 15, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;Tesla Makes a U-Turn in China.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 7, 2017","published":"2017-06-07 06:30:09","updated":"2017-06-07 06:30:09","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Tesla Takes Off in China","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-vanessa.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures for Fortune","caption":"Vanessa Zhu exits her Model X in front of a Tesla showroom in Beijing.

Now it wants to become the ESPN of competitive gaming. Will audiences play along?<\/h2>\n<p>A diapered dragon hatches from a polka-dotted egg. Casting off the speckled shards of its shell, it toddles out of its nest and crawls around curiously, flapping a pair of adorably tiny purple wings. Seconds later, a trio of extraterrestrial troublemakers appear, taunting the mythological infant. \u201cI <i>looove<\/i> baby dragons,\u201d their three-fingered ringleader says menacingly as he and his cohorts encircle their prey. \u201cEspecially medium-rare ones.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The diminutive dragon abruptly lashes out, disabling his opponents with a surprisingly forceful flame. \u201cOh yeah, Spyro wins!\u201d he gloats, trampolining on one of the fallen aliens with his chubby, clawed legs. Out of nowhere, a tall wizard with a Viking helmet appears and offers him a half-eaten corn dog. \u201cIt\u2019s barely touched,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, I\u2019m completely lost (a sensation that will recur several times while I\u2019m reporting this story). But were I quite a few years younger\u2014and a gamer\u2014I would have recognized the creatures on my screen as characters from <i>Skylanders,<\/i> a $3.5 billion \u201ctoys-to-life\u201d franchise created by videogame powerhouse <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Activision Blizzard<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"atvi\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">atvi<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. The Southern California company publishes several of the most popular titles in gaming history, from multiplayer combat series like <i>World of Warcraft<\/i> to smartphone time-suckers like <i>Candy Crush Saga.<\/i> The <i>Skylanders<\/i> franchise, which launched in 2011, has sold 300 million action figures and other toys in six years.<\/p>\n<p>The only part of this scene that might have struck my hypothetical gamer self as remotely odd is that, well, none of it took place during a game. Rather, I\u2019ve just watched the opening two minutes of the first season of <i>Skylanders Academy,<\/i> a TV spinoff that made its debut on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nflx\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nflx<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> in October. That program signals a new chapter for Activision Blizzard, a gaming Goliath that is attempting to hack-and-slash its way into becoming a more diversified\u2014and even more gargantuan\u2014entertainment juggernaut.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s growth to date, on games alone, already belongs on some sort of high scorer honor roll. In its last fiscal year, Activision Blizzard reported <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/04\/activision-overwatch-strong-quarter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record revenue<\/a> of $6.6 billion, up 42% from the year before. Over the past five years, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/09\/29\/activision-electronic-arts-shares\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its stock price<\/a> has risen more than 400%. The leader behind that performance, CEO Bobby Kotick, is now the longest-serving head of any publicly traded tech company\u2014and one of the highest paid. According to a recent <i>New York Times<\/i> report, Kotick was the 10th-best-compensated CEO in the U.S. last year, with a pay package of $33.1 million, nearly $25 million of it in stock. (Kotick is also dating one of the most powerful leaders in tech, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> COO Sheryl Sandberg.)<\/p>\n<p>This year, Activision Blizzard earned <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a spot on the <i>Fortune<\/i> 500<\/a> list for the first time in the company\u2019s 37-year history. In this industry, that\u2019s very rare air. Only two other videogame-centric companies have ever made the <i>Fortune<\/i> 500: Electronic Arts <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ea\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/electronic-arts\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ea<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and industry pioneer Atari. And neither had staying power: Electronic Arts graced the list just once, in 2010, while \u00adAtari lasted two years\u20141988 and 1989. (After several ownership changes and a bankruptcy, Atari is now part of a French media company.) The takeaway: Gaming may be mainstream entertainment, but game companies are hit-driven\u2014and none has successfully expanded beyond videogames.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:350px;\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/beta.fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2049382\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/500_rank_activision\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254\" data-orig-size=\"1200,870\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.500_rank_activision\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2049382\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&amp;h=254 350w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=700&amp;h=508 700w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=300&amp;h=218 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Activision Blizzard&#8217;s 2017 rank in the Fortune 500.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Activision Blizzard hopes to be the first.

Last year the gamemaker acquired Major League Gaming (MLG), a creator and distributor of e\u2011sports events. \u201cIt is like ESPN for videogames,\u201d Kotick tells <i>Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>MLG is still light years away from ESPN-level domination. But if anything, Kotick\u2019s analogy actually undersells his ambitions: It might be more accurate if ESPN not only distributed football games but also owned the National Football League\u2014and made all the footballs in the world as well. Later this year, Activision Blizzard will launch the Overwatch League, based on one of the company\u2019s hottest new titles. The league will essentially control all the competing teams and the distribution of all the games. Activision thinks that these opportunities, combined with sponsorships and advertising, not to mention <i>Overwatch<\/i>-branded merchandise like T-shirts and hats, could bring the company billions in annual revenue as the e\u2011sports audience grows. As a benchmark for how big it could get, the company notes that the NFL generates $12 billion in revenues, including $6.1 billion in media rights sales, from an audience of about 240 million. \u201cTen years from now, the role models in e\u2011sports [will] be like the stars in traditional sports,\u201d Kotick says.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048756\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-fanbase\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;David Chen&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1478268357&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;www.davidchen.gg&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.fanbase\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2048756 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" alt=\"\" width=\"2800\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg 2800w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Player Marcus Tan Sin Yik on Team Singapore Overwatch at BlizzCon 2016, a gathering of fans of Blizzard Entertainment games.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Activision Blizzard<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>These are just aspirations for now. MLG, like the company\u2019s other recent undertakings, hasn\u2019t yet resulted in new operating profits. And even if it were an instant hit, its revenue would be a teeny fraction of the NFL\u2019s. Still, Kotick, 54, has had his share of touchdowns. In 26 years as CEO, he has transformed Activision Blizzard from a financial mess nearing extinction into a behemoth with a $45 billion market cap and 17 gamemaking studios around the world, aggressively buying up other gamemakers and continually expanding its franchises.<\/p>\n<p>Relevancy demands constant growth and constant hits, and Kotick\u2019s latest strategy, finding new ways of milking profits from his IP, is one way of extending Activision Blizzard\u2019s dominance. If the idea sounds Disneyesque\u2014well, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/disney\/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"dis\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/disney\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">dis<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> experts would agree. \u201cThe approach he is taking leads them down a road similar to the one Disney has been on in the last 15 years or so,\u201d says Tom Staggs, the former COO and CFO of Disney and a longtime friend of Kotick\u2019s.

Activision Blizzard has long been criticized for focusing on existing franchises instead of investing in new and innovative products. There is a fine line between breathing new life into your franchises and pumping them so hard for profits that you suck the life out of them\u2014and drive away your fans. As Atari cofounder Nolan Bushnell points out, \u201cThe financial strategy for these big blockbusters can lead to things getting stale because you want to do <i>Rocky<\/i> No. 247 instead of innovate\u2009\u2026\u2009But entertainment is ultimately about novelty.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Do even a cursory search of gamer blogs and you\u2019ll see some colorful vilifications of Kotick. (Univision-owned blog Kotaku once called him \u201cthe most hated man in videogames,\u201d though the writer also said he had a \u201cdelightful chat\u201d with the exec.) Much of the animosity comes from ROI-minded things that Kotick has told the investment community\u2014he once said at a conference that his focus was taking \u201cthe fun out of making videogames.\u201d But no one disputes his success.<\/p>\n<p>The college dropout got his start as a developer for the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> II in the early 1980s. At just 19, he founded a software company, Arktronics, with funding from Las Vegas developer Steve Wynn\u2014the two had met at a party in Texas. Arktronics eventually went out of business, but in 1990, when Kotick was 27, he convinced Wynn and another partner to buy a controlling stake in Activision, a gaming company founded by four former Atari programmers. Activision was a pioneer\u2014it was the first gamemaker that wasn\u2019t owned by a console provider\u2014but it was mired in bankruptcy proceedings related to a patent-infringement lawsuit. For $500,000, Kotick and his team snapped up a 25% stake. By 1991 the determined entrepreneur was the CEO.<\/p>\n<p>Kotick quickly reorganized the company. In an ecosystem where new games are generally created by startups, Kotick proved adept at spotting companies with great ideas and sustainable profitability\u2014and then gobbling them up\u2014staff, IP, and all. Over the ensuing decades, Activision grew primarily through acquisitions, including those of Raven Software and skateboarding gamemaker Neversoft. In 2008, Activision merged with the gaming division of French media conglomerate Vivendi. Blizzard was one of the studios within that portfolio: It had an impeccable reputation for quality and a loyal following\u2014among other titles, it published the popular <i>Warcraft<\/i> franchise. Activision Blizzard was formed, with Kotick still at the head.<\/p>\n<p>Like all companies vying for consumers\u2019 attention, Activision Blizzard now faces more rivals than ever. \u201cThat includes people watching shows on Netflix, movies, or anything else,\u201d says Brian Nowak, a Morgan Stanley analyst who covers the company. Anything else <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/22\/mobile-gaming-pc-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">includes \u201ccasual\u201d mobile games<\/a> played on smartphones. While it typically takes multiple years and tens of millions of dollars to design a graphics-heavy standard videogame, mobile games are fast and cheap. Activision Blizzard has managed not only to mitigate those threats, but also to thrive. (Its most significant recent acquisition was <i>Candy Crush<\/i> maker King Digital Entertainment, in 2016.) It can also now deliver many of its games online\u2014allowing for faster, cheaper updates and, importantly, for in-game purchases and upgrades.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:280px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-bobbykotick.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048774\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-bobbykotick\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-bobbykotick.jpg?w=280&#038;h=382\" data-orig-size=\"1407,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;9&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Cody Pickens&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Hasselblad H4D-40&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1495209369&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 M.

But analysts say that edition sold less than its predecessors. Set in outer space, the installment was criticized by fans of the franchise for being too futuristic. This year\u2019s <i>Call of Duty<\/i> title (a new version is published each year) will go back to the game\u2019s World War II roots.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe should have done more work thinking about how much of a departure from the franchise going to space would be,\u201d admits Kotick. But the mini-uprising also underscores the fickle nature of the business\u2014and the importance of extending durable brands in new ways.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a warm afternoon in mid-May when I meet Kotick at Blizzard\u2019s studio in Irvine, Calif. As at many Silicon Valley companies, the studio\u2019s workforce is mostly young and largely male. But there are a lot more tattoos and purple hair than you\u2019d find at, say, Facebook\u2019s fresh-faced HQ. It isn\u2019t as bright and cheerful here, either\u2014game developers and designers, it turns out, have a penchant for dungeon-like lighting. Seated in a corner of the cafeteria, Kotick stands out. In khakis, brown loafers, and a button-down shirt under a sweater vest, he looks less like a tech mogul and more like an off-duty attorney visiting his coding-crazy kid at work.<\/p>\n<p>Kotick\u2019s voice is so low and muted that I have to lean in to hear him (my recording would barely pick up his answers). His ambition, however, speaks loudly. \u201cThe fact that we can entertain people in every country, everywhere in the world\u2014that was always an aspiration I had,\u201d says Kotick.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>SQUEEZING CASH FROM BLOCKBUSTER GAMES<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048754\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-characters\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976\" data-orig-size=\"1424,976\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.characters\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2048754 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976\" alt=\"\" width=\"1424\" height=\"976\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg 1424w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=768&amp;h=526 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Characters from an array of Activision Blizzard games.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Activision Blizzard<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Activision Blizzard\u2019s success has been driven by smart repetition: It builds (or buys) games with great hooks, then franchises them like crazy.

Steve Bornstein, a former CEO of ESPN and cable\u2019s NFL Network, is the chair of Kotick\u2019s e\u2011sports division (former Fox Sports EVP Pete Vlastelica, meanwhile, is its CEO). A former Disney exec, Tim Kilpin, was recently hired to run the company\u2019s consumer products division. (One more Mouse House connection: Sandberg, Kotick\u2019s girlfriend, serves on Disney\u2019s board of directors.) And Stacey Sher, the long-time producing partner of Quentin Tarantino, is now copresident of Activision Blizzard\u2019s fledgling TV and film business.<\/p>\n<p>Kotick feels confident he\u2019s placed bets on the right people; time will tell if he\u2019s picked the right game.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Somewhere on the Internet, a young woman named Riley Youngs is eating a chicken sandwich, and scores of people\u2014myself included\u2014are watching the mundane act in real time. Youngs is a budding \u201cstreamer,\u201d someone who plays videogames online for a living. Her forum of choice is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch<\/a>, a wildly popular, Amazon-owned website that showcases gamers who broadcast themselves.<\/p>\n<p>About 150,000 fans have watched Youngs do her thing online\u2014her thing being playing Activision Blizzard\u2019s <i>Overwatch<\/i>, along with the occasional live-streamed lunch break. Today\u2019s video stream is titled \u201cLOOK AT MA NEW FOKIN HAIRCUT,\u201d which refers to her \u00adbelow-the-shoulder-length locks, dark brown on top and almost blond underneath.<\/p>\n<p>Viewers follow along. In the main box on the busy web page is a dynamic screenshot of the game on her computer. To the left, a smaller square shows Youngs via webcam as she sits at her monitor. And to the right runs a constant feed of comments and questions from her thousands of viewers\u2014inquiring minds who want to know what virtual weapon she\u2019s going to pick up next and how much she paid for her new hairdo.<\/p>\n<p>This stream will last more than six hours. (Youngs, a 24-year-old from Michigan, later tells me she streams for four to eight hours a day). I have a much shorter attention span, but I watch long enough to see why <i>Overwatch,<\/i> a multiplayer, first-person-shooter title, has become Blizzard\u2019s fastest-growing game to date, generating more than $1 billion in revenue and amassing 30 million players since its introduction just a year ago\u2014and why it\u2019s the game to which Kotick is harnessing his e\u2011sports ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>Youngs\u2019 character runs through some kind of high-elevation temple, encircled by snowcapped mountains, shooting at creatures that are moving so fast it\u2019s hard to make them out. All you see of her in-game self is the tip of the futuristic, golden firearm with which she kills off opponents. On the smaller screen, I see the face of \u201cin real life\u201d Youngs, mostly scrunched in a concentrated squint.<\/p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, the experience is like staring into a digital version of an M.C. Escher print. But for millions, the site\u2014and others like it\u2014presents <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/06\/most-popular-esports-games-on-twitch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hours of engaged entertainment<\/a>. Activision Blizzard has about 450 million monthly users globally, who spent a collective 43 billion hours playing its games last year. Notably, a record 3 billion hours were spent <i>viewing<\/i> its games in that same time span.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen people ask me what I do, I say I play videogames,\u201d says Brandon \u201cSeagull\u201d Larned, one of the best-known <i>Overwatch<\/i> streamers. \u201cThey think it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Larned explains that there are two career paths for gamers. The first is streaming, which allows players with considerable followings to share in profit from advertising. The second involves endorsements and prizes for competing in pro tournaments.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048777\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1463762434&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;28&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.003125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.hollywoodblvd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2048777 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" alt=\"\" width=\"2800\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg 2800w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A character from the game &#8220;Overwatch&#8221; on display near the Hollywood Walk of Fame .<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Activision Blizzard<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A few high-end streamers and e\u2011sports competitors make seven-figure salaries; most do not. While Larned doesn\u2019t disclose his income, he does say he quit a computer science program at Washington State because \u201cthere was too much money to be made\u201d as a professional gamer. Larned, known for his \u201cdazzling Genji play\u201d (don\u2019t ask), may soon have an even bigger career opportunity\u2014the 24-year-old is a contender for the Overwatch League.<\/p>\n<p>At the moment, viewership for gaming is not unlike golf\u2014if you play golf, you\u2019ll watch golf. But Kotick hopes to make e\u2011sports more mainstream, more sticky. One way he\u2019s doing that: instituting teams that are city-based\u2014a first in professional e\u2011sports. Just like Green Bay\u2019s Packers, <i>Overwatch<\/i> teams will be tied to cities. (Activision Blizzard hasn\u2019t yet said how many teams will exist and in which locations.) Of course, unlike the NFL\u2014or the NBA, the MLB, or the NHL\u2014<i>Overwatch<\/i> has been around for only a year. \u201cIf I\u2019m [a potential sponsor], I have a pretty good confidence that the L.A. Kings [hockey team] will be around in five years,\u201d says Morgan Stanley\u2019s Nowak. \u201cBut how do I know that <i>Overwatch<\/i> will?\u201d Still, Activision Blizzard thinks <i>Overwatch<\/i> has advantages, despite its \u201cnoob\u201d status (gamer-speak for new). Going with a recently launched title lets the league start from scratch\u2014more established titles like <i>Call of Duty<\/i> or <i>World of Warcraft<\/i> are already played by several existing e\u2011sports teams and leagues.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard doesn\u2019t have to deal with the legacy TV networks that have tied up traditional sports rights for years. \u201cE\u2011sports is the first digital native sport,\u201d says Vlastelica, the Fox Sports veteran who heads MLG. \u201cWe\u2019re not encumbered by the paid-TV ecosystem that keeps the content out of the hands of young people who, frankly, don\u2019t watch TV.\u201d At the same time, the hope is that transforming itself into the \u201cESPN of videogames\u201d will help Activision Blizzard make e\u2011sports more recognizable to the masses. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the evolution of the games themselves to becoming more broadly appealing as a spectator sport,\u201d says Kotick.<\/p>\n<p>That evolution is not lost on the real, Disney-owned ESPN, which launched a dedicated e\u2011sports vertical on its website last year. The audience is \u201cnot enormous,\u201d says Marie Donoghue, EVP of global business and content strategy at ESPN, but \u201cthe fans are passionate and engaged, the athletes and teams are compelling.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s also incredibly popular among a demographic we know well\u2014young men.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>As lucrative as that demographic is, Kotick\u2019s plans\u2014including the Overwatch League\u2014could enable Activision Blizzard to reach beyond it. The vast majority of e\u2011sports pros, like the majority of gamers, are men. But players like Youngs are reminders that capability in videogames doesn\u2019t rely on muscle mass or size. And the marketing and expansion of other sports leagues has generally led to more gender parity in their audiences\u2014the NFL, for example, says that women now account for almost half its fan base.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that Kotick has this ideal in mind as the Overwatch League gears up. \u201cI think it\u2019s the first game on a broad scale where about half the characters [are] women,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a level playing field.\u201d Indeed, <i>Overwatch<\/i> features equal numbers of men and women heroes plus three \u201comnic\u201d (that means robotic) characters and a male scientist who happens to be a gorilla.<\/p>\n<p>Activision Blizzard\u2019s real-life leaders don\u2019t yet reflect such parity. Only one out of nine board members is female, and there\u2019s not one woman on its eight-person \u201csenior corporate management\u201d team. It\u2019s notable that one of the company\u2019s few leading women\u2014the newish hire, Stacey Sher\u2014is tasked with bringing Activision Blizzard\u2019s IP to movies and TV shows, media that more easily cross gender lines. \u201cYou have to have control of your script and your movies,\u201d says Sher, whose production credits include <i>Garden State<\/i> and <i>The Hateful Eight.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Last year Sher put together a \u201cwriters room\u201d in a house in Los Angeles, where six handpicked creatives sat every day for a month to brainstorm adaptation ideas; they now have three projects in various stages of screenwriting. Of course, they\u2019re all variations on the <i>Call of Duty<\/i> series\u2014a war-driven franchise where male characters dominate. Turns out there\u2019s a daunting amount of testosterone in Activision Blizzard\u2019s DNA.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Kotick\u2019s strategy suggests that he\u2019s willing to alter that code to make Activision Blizzard a bigger, faster-growing entertainment company. In February, in its latest annual report, Activision Blizzard said it will have a light slate of game releases this year when compared with 2016. (There won\u2019t be a new \u201cfull console\u201d <i>Skylanders<\/i> game, for instance.) The implicit message: It\u2019s time for the company to invest in new areas, from its position of strength. If it doesn\u2019t, it risks going the way of its predecessors, companies that became one-hit wonders, metaphorically speaking, no matter how many games they created.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the June 15, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;A Giant Enters a New Arena.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 7, 2017","published":"2017-06-07 06:30:16","updated":"2017-06-07 06:30:16","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Activision Blizzard Aims for the Big Leagues","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-convention.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Courtesy of Activision Blizzard","caption":"&quot;Overwatch&quot; competitors inside the The Overwatch Arena at BlizzCon 2016.

Here&#8217;s what you need to know about safeguarding your digital assets.<\/i><\/h2>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. Under attack<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">In the summer of 2015, several of New York\u2019s most prestigious and trusted corporate law firms, including Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore and Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, found themselves under cyberattack. A trio of hackers in China had snuck into the firms\u2019 computer networks by tricking partners into revealing their email passwords. Once inside the partners\u2019 accounts, the thieves snooped on highly sensitive documents about upcoming mergers. Then, from computers halfway around the world, the cybercrooks allegedly traded on the purloined information, netting $4 million in stock market gains.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Like most other victims of corporate espionage, the firms preferred to keep mum about having been victimized. They feared antagonizing other digital thugs as well as damaging their reputations as keepers of clients\u2019 secrets. Instead, word of the attack leaked in the press and then was confirmed by federal prosecutors and the firms themselves. The Feds made public their discoveries and trumpeted their efforts to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice. \u201cThis case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,\u201d said Preet Bharara, then the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. \u201cYou are and will be the targets of cyberhacking because you have information valuable to would-be criminals.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068797\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac07_a\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674\" data-orig-size=\"8457,5564\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;P65+&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1497539459&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0080000237565665&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HAC.07.01.17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2068797 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=674 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1348 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=300&amp;h=197 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=768&amp;h=505 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">The Voorhes for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\">It may have been a shock to the system for the legal community, but the incident only served to underscore a hard truth that CEOs, company directors, and network security experts have been grappling with for some time now: Business is under assault like never before from hackers, and the cost and severity of the problem is escalating almost daily.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The latest statistics are a call to arms: According to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cisco-systems\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco<\/a>, the number of so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\u2014assaults that flood a system\u2019s servers with junk web traffic\u2014jumped globally by 172% in 2016. Cisco projects the total to grow by another two and a half times, to 3.1 million attacks, by 2021. Indeed, the pace of cyberassaults is only increasing. Internet security firm Nexusguard reports that it observed a 380% increase in the number of DDoS attacks in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">As the number and scale of network attacks grow, the toll on business is rising. The average total cost of a data breach in the U.S. in 2014 was $5.85 million, according to research from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/ibm\/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM<\/a> and the Ponemon Institute, and this year it\u2019s estimated to be $7.35 million. According to a report earlier this year from business insurer Hiscox, cybercrime cost the global economy more than $450 billion in 2016. The WannaCry ransomware attack alone, which crippled computers in more than 150 countries in May, could cost as much as $4 billion according to some estimates.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more, read &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-hacks-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here Are 10 of the Biggest Corporate Hacks in History<\/a>.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2069363\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/cropped-hand-of-computer-hacker-typing-on-keyboard-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\" data-orig-size=\"4608,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Oliver Nicolaas Ponder \\\/ EyeEm&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;E-M10&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1446563835&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Getty Images\\\/EyeEm&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.04&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cropped Hand Of Computer Hacker Typing On Keyboard&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HAC.07.01.17\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2069363 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\" alt=\"Cropped Hand Of Computer Hacker Typing On Keyboard\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1536 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Oliver Nicolaas Ponder\/EyeEm Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\">What is slowly dawning on corporate hacking victims is how vulnerable and defenseless they really are, even when their opponents may be three guys in a room halfway around the world. Expensive data-security systems and high-priced information security consultants don\u2019t faze today\u2019s hackers, who have the resources to relentlessly mount assaults until they succeed. In the New York law-firm case, for example, prosecutors said the attackers attempted to penetrate targeted servers more than 100,000 times over seven months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It has become abundantly clear that no network is completely safe. Where once companies thought they could defend themselves against an onslaught, they\u2019re now realizing that resistance is, if not futile, certainly less important than having a plan in place to detect and neutralize intruders when they strike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But there remains a gaping chasm between awareness of the threat and readiness to address it: A survey last fall by IBM and Ponemon of 2,400 security and IT professionals found that 75% of the respondents said they did not have a formal cybersecurity incident response plan across their organization. And 66% of those who replied weren\u2019t confident in their organization\u2019s ability to recover from an attack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Cybercrime is metastasizing for the same reason online services have become so popular with consumers and businesses alike: Ever-more-accessible technology. Hacking is easier than ever thanks to the ever-growing number of online targets and the proliferation of off-the-shelf attack software. The very Internet networks that were built for convenience and profit are exposing their users to a steady stream of new threats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s more, the tense state of affairs is a glaring example of how the entire nature of business has changed in the digital age. In most cases, technology is much more than just a supplement to a company\u2019s core operations. For scores of the world\u2019s most valuable companies\u2014from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/alphabet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> to Uber\u2014the assets that live on their networks <i>are<\/i> their core operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">No sector of corporate America is safe. Hackers have plundered big retailers like Neiman Marcus and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/home-depot\/\" target=\"_blank\">Home Depot<\/a> for credit card and customer information. They\u2019ve burrowed into banks like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/jp-morgan-chase\/\" target=\"_blank\">JPMorgan Chase<\/a>. Even tech companies can\u2019t seem to protect themselves. Yahoo\u2019s ineptitude in repelling (or even being aware of) hackers forced it to reduce its sale price to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon<\/a>. Google and Facebook recently fell victim to a hacker who conned their accountants into wiring him a total of more than $100 million. And OneLogin, a startup that bills itself as a secure password management service, recently lost certain customer data to hackers.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In one survey, 66% of security and I.T. professionals replied that they weren&#8217;t confident that their organization could recover from a cyberattack.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p4\">It\u2019s not like companies aren\u2019t trying to play defense. Accenture estimates that companies worldwide spent $84 billion in 2015 to protect against attacks. That spending is an acknowledgment that every company needs to safeguard its digital assets, which in turn requires knowing about the criminals that keep coming at them and what defenses they can build to minimize the damage.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. A new breed of criminal<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hacking is particularly frustrating for corporate executives who don\u2019t understand their enemy. Embezzlers or extortionists? Sure. But faceless gangs of nasty nerds? It\u2019s often harder for CEOs to wrap their brains around the motivation of their antagonists\u2014or their audacity. \u201cAt the C-level they feel violated,\u201d says Jay Leek, a venture capitalist pursuing cybersecurity investments and a former chief information security officer at private equity giant Blackstone. \u201cI witness this emotional \u2018What just happened?\u2019 You don\u2019t walk in physically to a company and violate it.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2067840\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"4200,2800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Rebecca Greenfield&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1497571200&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 Rebecca Greenfield 2016&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HAC.07.01.17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2067840\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Nicole Friedlander, a New York lawyer specializing in cybercrime, says hackers collaborate more today and &#8220;no longer need all the skills to complete any particular crime.&#8221;<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Rebecca Greenfield for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The brazenness Leek describes is a hallmark of hackers who\u2014despite their mystique in popular culture\u2014are basically everyday thieves, like bank robbers. Where hackers are different, however, is that they rarely meet in person. Instead, they convene in online forums on the \u201cdark web,\u201d an anonymous layer of the Internet that requires a special browser to access. Deep in the forums, crooks hatch hacking plots of all sorts: breaking into corporate databases or selling stolen Social Security numbers or purchasing inside information from unscrupulous employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Cybercriminals have proved adept at adopting successful corporate strategies of their own. A recent development has seen the cleverest crooks selling hacking tools to criminal small-fry. It\u2019s analogous to semiconductor companies licensing their technology to device manufacturers. According to a report from security software giant <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/symantec\/\" target=\"_blank\">Symantec<\/a>, gangs now offer so-called ransomware as a service, a trick that involves licensing software that freezes computer files until a company pays up. The gangs then take their cut for providing the license to their criminal customers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">If it weren\u2019t all blatantly illegal, the practices would be laudably corporate. \u201cCybercriminals no longer need all the skills to complete any particular crime,\u201d says Nicole Friedlander, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the key Southern District of New York\u2019s complex fraud and cybercrime unit. \u201cInstead, they can hire other cybercriminals online who have those skills and do it together.\u201d In that sense, hackers have become service providers like doctors or lawyers or anyone else, says Friedlander, who joined the New York office of law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell last year.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068789\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac_cost\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532\" data-orig-size=\"1220,634\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hac_cost\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows the average cost of a data breach since 2005&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2068789 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&amp;h=532 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=150&amp;h=78 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=300&amp;h=156 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=768&amp;h=399 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But the bad guys aren\u2019t all freelancers.

Playing defense<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">In early March, the information security team at ride-hailing giant Uber leaped into action: An Uber employee had reported a suspicious email message, and similar reports were flooding in from all over the company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Uber\u2019s databases contain the email addresses and personal information of millions of riders around the world, making security a particularly pressing issue. And the company has had its share of problems as a caretaker of sensitive data. In 2014, Uber suffered a breach that exposed the insurance and driver\u2019s license information of tens of thousands of drivers; it took the mega-startup months to discover and investigate the incident and fully notify its drivers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As soon as the alarm was raised in March, Uber established an \u201cincident commander\u201d to manage the developing situation. The job of the incident commander\u2014a term of art in cybersecurity circles\u2014is to keep the company informed about potential attacks. It turned out that the attack was targeting users of Google\u2019s Gmail service, not Uber itself. But anyone with a Gmail address was vulnerable. Later that same day Google fixed the vulnerability in its Gmail service, allowing Uber\u2019s incident commander to stand down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Uber\u2019s reaction is an example of the vigilance with which companies must treat the torrent of threats coming at them every day. John \u201cFour\u201d Flynn, a former Facebook executive who now is chief information security officer for Uber, says the key to cybersecurity incidents\u2014which he defines as everything from a data breach to a stolen laptop\u2014is to have a clear communication strategy. \u201cDuring an incident, the role of executives is to give support,\u201d says Flynn. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for confusion about who\u2019s in charge.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068788\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac_cost_per_size\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483\" data-orig-size=\"1220,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hac_cost_per_size\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows the average cost of data breaches&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2068788 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&amp;h=483 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=150&amp;h=71 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=300&amp;h=142 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=768&amp;h=363 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Flynn has every right to sound confident in his authority. The chief information security officer, or CISO, is possibly the hottest job in the C-suite today. Cybercrime is so serious that these formerly little-known and unloved executives now typically have a direct line to boards of directors\u2014a big break from the past. Before, the CISO would report to the chief information officer, who was responsible for buying and operating computers, not obsessing over flies in the ointment. If the CISO sounded the alarm over a breach, too often he or she ended up being the one sacrificed to appease top management. \u201cIt was my job to tell my boss his baby was ugly,\u201d one former information security executive laments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These days, though, smart companies treat hacking threats like other existential risks to their business\u2014recessions, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters come to mind\u2014and plan accordingly. The CISO is pivotal in maintaining readiness. \u201cIf you\u2019re a <i>Fortune<\/i> 500 company, you already have a response,\u201d says Leek, the former executive at Blackstone, which had several portfolio companies that suffered breaches, including arts-and-crafts merchant Michaels Stores. \u201cBut people forget to take it out, blow the dust off, and recall: \u2018Let\u2019s do what we decided when we had a sound mind.\u2019 \u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a clear line of authority and a good action plan take a company only so far. At some point it has to call the cops, specifically the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the U.S. Secret Service. Both agencies have reach and power that allow them to take the fight to foreign cybercrooks. On several occasions, U.S. law enforcement agents working undercover on the dark web have managed to lure presumed offenders out of hiding with phony deals, and then had them apprehended in and extradited to the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>During the incident, the role of executives is to give support,&#8221; says Uber&#8217;s chief information officer. &#8220;There&#8217;s no room for confusion about who&#8217;s in charge.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Calling law enforcement has downsides, however. The likely outcome\u2014an investigation\u2014imposes burdens on the victim company in terms of money and time. And it increases the chance that sensitive details about the hack will leak publicly. That\u2019s why the best course of action is for companies to avoid FBI-level hacking incidents in the first place. A new, multibillion-dollar industry has sprung up to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. An industry is born<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The videoconference camera looked like any other. But unbeknownst to its corporate owner, the device was working overtime: Hackers had captured the microphone remotely and were using it to spy on every meeting that took place in the boardroom. The company, which does not want to be identified, finally got wise to the spying scheme thanks to Darktrace, a global cybersecurity company that uses artificial intelligence to detect aberrant activity on client networks. Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan says her company noticed the camera had been gobbling abnormal amounts of data. This raised a red flag, enabling Darktrace to notify its client that something was amiss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Darktrace is just one of hundreds of firms that offer help to combat the hacking epidemic. Once a stodgy corner of enterprise software, cybersecurity has become a hot sector for venture capitalists. Investors put some $3.5 billion into a total of 404 security startups last year, according to New York research firm CB Insights. That\u2019s up from $1.8 billion for 279 investments in 2013.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignnone\" style=\"max-width:610px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068786\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac_tactics\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340\" data-orig-size=\"610,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hac_tactics\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows tactics used in data breaches&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340?w=610\" class=\"wp-image-2068786 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png 610w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=300&amp;h=167 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\">For executives, all of this entrepreneurial activity translates into a dizzying array of security options. There are newcomers like Tanium, for instance, which offers a service that lets companies see who is on their network. Publicly traded Palo Alto Networks makes a kind of intelligent firewall that uses machine learning to thwart intruders. There are also a host of niche security firms such as Area 1 (which specializes in defending against phishing scams) and Lookout (which is a mobile-phone-focused security service).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With all of this firepower arrayed against it, how can cybercrime continue to grow so fast? One answer is that some of the glitzy defense systems don\u2019t work as advertised. Security insiders grumble about firms bamboozling clients with \u201cblinky lights\u201d in order to sell \u201cscareware\u201d\u2014software that plays to customers\u2019 insecurities but doesn\u2019t protect them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">At the end of the day, though, humans are as much to blame as software. \u201cThe weak underbelly of security is not tech failure but poor process implementation or social engineering,\u201d says Asheem Chandna, an investor with Greylock Partners and a Palo Alto Networks director. Chandna notes that most hacking attacks come about in two ways, neither of which involves a high level of technical sophistication: An employee clicks on a booby-trapped link or attachment\u2014perhaps in an email that appears to be from her boss\u2014or someone steals an employee\u2019s log-in credentials and gets access to the company network.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">While cyberdefense tools can mitigate such attacks, some will always succeed. Humans are curious creatures and, in a big organization, there will always be someone who clicks on a message like, \u201cUh-oh. Did you see these pictures of you from the office party?\u201d When it comes to hacking, a penny of offense can defeat a dollar\u2019s worth of defense.

As <em>Fortune<\/em> explains <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the cover story of our Jul. 1 issue<\/a>, today the biggest and baddest hacker groups are backed by nation-states. They\u2019re called \u201cadvanced persistent threats\u201d or APTs, in the cyber jargon, a phrase meant to convey their supreme and underlying quality: ferocity. Below are a few of the most notorious\u2014and feared\u2014state-affiliated hacking groups around. (Links to specific hacks below are based on leading theories put forward by top computer forensic firms.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Fancy Bear<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b> (a.k.a. Sofacy, Pawn Storm) \/ <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><b>Cozy Bear <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. CozyDuke, Office Monkeys)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Rival agencies in the Russian spy services, the two \u201cBears\u201d were thrust into the spotlight during <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/14\/russians-hacking-39-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election<\/a> for their roles in allegedly breaching the Democratic National Committee\u2019s system. Fancy Bear, which comes out of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, has been meddling in European elections since then. Cozy Bear, which represents the FSB, Russia\u2019s successor to the Soviet-era KGB, has hit U.S. think tanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Lazarus Group<\/b> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. DarkSeoul, Guardians of Peace)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\">Widely believed to be associated with North Korea, this gang refuses to die. Lazarus got its start by pummeling American and South \u00adKorean websites with denial-of-\u00adservice attacks in 2009. Five years later, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sony-hack-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it perpetrated a massive hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment<\/a>. In 2016, Lazarus stole $81 million in a heist targeting Bangladesh\u2019s central bank and the SWIFT financial network. And it has <span class=\"s1\">been linked to the \u00adWannaCry<\/span> ransomware worm that ground businesses around the globe to a halt in May.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Equation Group<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\">This is the nickname given by Russian antivirus firm Kaspersky to a team believed to be associated with the U.S. National Security Agency\u2014specifically the NSA\u2019s Tailored Access Operations unit, or TAO. They\u2019re the good guys, right? Not in everyone\u2019s eyes. Many experts believe the Equation Group successfully attacked Iran\u2019s nuclear program in the mid-aughts. But recently a selection of the squad\u2019s hacking tools were stolen and leaked by the Shadow Brokers, another mysterious hacker group (believed to be Russia-affiliated), and are now being used to cause mayhem<span class=\"s1\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Comment Crew<\/b> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. APT1, Shanghai Group)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">China sponsors a plethora of hacking groups. One of the most notorious, believed to be part of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, came to be known as Comment Crew for its habit of hiding comments on web pages. Exposed by forensic investigators at Mandiant, the group has been linked to intrusions at big name companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ko\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ko<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> , RSA, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/lockheed-martin\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lockheed Martin<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"lmt\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/lockheed-martin\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">lmt<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> . Chinese industrial espionage has been on the decline since former U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to cool it on the cyber front last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Sandworm<\/b> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. Electrum)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Named for allusions to the sci-fi classic <i>Dune<\/i> found in its code, Sandworm is another group believed to be associated with the Russians. The crew has hacked people affiliated with NATO and the Ukrainian government, presumably to gather intelligence. Sandworm is also known for breaking into companies that deal with critical infrastructure. Last year the group shut down a power grid in Ukraine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously associated APT1\/Comment Crew with Operation Aurora, an attack

These brick-and-mortar locations instantly give it a national \u00adphysical presence, as well as a network of mini distribution centers for fresh produce\u2014by far the most challenging part of the grocery delivery business because of spoilage and the fragility of fruits and vegetables. (Upon news of the bid, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/16\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-stock\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grocery stocks took a nosedive<\/a> accordingly.)<\/p>\n<p>But Amazon isn\u2019t just trying to change how we buy groceries. Remember the company\u2019s original disruption: bookselling. Jeff Bezos not only shifted how and where books were sold; he also changed how they were made, by forcing publishers, authors, and everybody else along the book supply chain to cut their costs. The same thing could very well happen in food, and the outcome for food manufacturers could be as dire it was for book publishers. \u201cI would be terrified if I were a consumer packaged-goods company right now,\u201d says Benzi Ronen, CEO and founder of food hub management software startup Farmigo. Indeed, packaged-goods producers\u2019 businesses are already under stress, with manufactured-food volumes at large companies declining 4% this year, as consumers seek out less-processed fare.

This is not your mother\u2019s generic box of cornflakes, with its bad design and perceived quality issues. A Piper Jaffray survey last spring found that 365 is customers\u2019 favorite organic-food brand, ahead of premium names like Kellogg\u2019s-owned Kashi and General Mills\u2019 Annie\u2019s. The 365 brand is virtually unavailable online, but that will change if Amazon is smart about it. \u201cThe opportunity to use the 365 brand as a mainstay of their online offering is really profound,\u201d says Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard. \u201cIt puts a huge amount of pressure on branded food sales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amazon has tried to develop its own private label in food for years. In 2016 it rolled out its Happy Belly coffee, Mama Bear baby food, and Wickedly Prime snacks. These brands are available only to Amazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free two-day shipping, among a litany of other benefits. In a sign of how powerful its private label can be, analytics company 1010data found that for a 12-month period ending last year, 94% of all batteries sold online went through Amazon sites, and Amazon\u2019s own brand made up about a third of all online battery sales. Its Amazon Elements baby wipes, introduced in 2014, have managed to capture 16% of online market share, despite being available only to Prime members.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon and Whole Foods might seem like they are on opposite ends of the retail spectrum\u2014a relatively small, high-end grocer vs. the massive e-commerce Everything Store\u2014but they overlap in the power of their brands. That\u2019s a rarity for a purveyor of food. Under the old model of food retailing, \u201cthe brand you trusted was the manufacturer,\u201d Ronen says. \u201cToday you go onto Amazon and filter everything by what\u2019s Prime.\u201d Similarly, Whole Foods acts as a curator for shoppers by banning ingredients like saccharin and bleached flour from the products it sells. Together, the two trusted brands should create an even more powerful one. That could fundamentally alter the way grocery aisles look\u2014and even make the aisles themselves obsolete.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Jul. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;The Deal That Made an Industry Shudder.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 22, 2017","published":"2017-06-22 08:00:12","updated":"2017-06-22 08:00:12","minute":"8:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-disruption\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-disruption\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-disruption\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"20\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5473976997001-20\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5473976997001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tOggay\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Cfood%2Cretail%2Cwholefoods%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dwholefoods&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>The deal that made an industry shudder.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381326","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/beth-kowitt\/","name":"Beth Kowitt","twitter":"bethkowitt","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599149\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/kowitt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Beth Kowitt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Beth Kowitt is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine, where she covers food and agriculture, consumer behavior, and sustainability.

But it could also herald a new chapter for Silicon Valley itself. The age of so-called startup unicorns has had its share of meltdowns, including onetime blood-\u00adtesting darling Theranos and insurance software notable Zenefits. But Uber is different: It\u2019s the largest, most valuable, most global, most disruptive, most quintessential Silicon Valley success story.<\/p>\n<p>Kalanick\u2019s departure <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-why-it-matter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has the potential to affect<\/a> the way local regulators view disruptive startups that operate in legal gray areas, the way labor regulators look at Silicon Valley workplaces, and the way securities regulators view low-information startup stock sales. (Before, Uber was \u201ccontroversial.\u201d Now its bad behavior could serve as justification for tighter regulation.)<\/p>\n<p>Uber\u2019s moment of truth could also <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">influence startup valuations<\/a> and the way investors assess risk for companies with founder-controlled boards. It could affect the kinds of executives that want to leave cushy jobs in mainstream sectors to become \u201cthe adult\u201d at Silicon Valley startups. And it could deter would-be entrepreneurs who might otherwise have been seduced by the cult of personality surrounding unicorn CEOs.<\/p>\n<p>This wake-up call for the tech industry has been <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/uber-controversy-timeline-travis-kalanick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at least six months in the making<\/a>. Uber was not the only company with a reportedly toxic culture, an obsession with disruption over following the rules, and a win-at-any-cost strategy; it was just the most successful. Because those characteristics had worked so well, others emulated the formula. Scores of \u201cUber for X\u201d companies hoping to re-create its success may now be rethinking their plans. Uber\u2019s story is no longer a playbook. It\u2019s a cautionary tale.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;What Uber Means for the Valley.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 22, 2017","published":"2017-06-22 09:00:24","updated":"2017-06-22 09:00:24","minute":"9:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning-tech\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning-tech\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning-tech\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"21\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5478989294001-21\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5478989294001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2rRVj23\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Duber%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Duber&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>His resignation will have wide-ranging repercussions for startup culture, regulation, and more.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"273114","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/erin-griffith\/","name":"Erin Griffith","twitter":"eringriffith","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1602497\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=1602497\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Erin Griffith\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Erin Griffith is a senior writer.
