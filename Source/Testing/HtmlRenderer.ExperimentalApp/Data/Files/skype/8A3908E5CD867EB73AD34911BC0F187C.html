Please make it stop.\nI'm not just talking about Trump making idiotic moves like pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement. (There seems to be no stopping Mr. Tiny Hands from flipping the bird to everything that we hold dear.)\nNo, I'm talking about apps shamefully ripping off Snapchat Stories.\nSEE ALSO: Deciding where to post on social media is too damn hard now\nAs I've said many times before, this is all Facebook's fault.\nWhen Instagram (a Facebook-owned company) cloned the crap out of Snapchat Stories a year ago, we all shook our heads, pointed our fingers, and laughed at how scared it must have been to copy one of Snapchat's core features.\nAnd then everyone caved in and started using it. Whether that's because Instagram is a larger platform or Instagram Stories is easier to use than Snapchat Stories -- it doesn't matter. People love Instagram Stories and it's destroying all of Snapchat.\nI admit, I tried my best to resist Instagram Stories -- I already used Snapchat Stories, so why would I want to use a copycat? -- but I gave in a few weeks ago, and now I rarely post anything to Snapchat Stories. Like my colleague Damon Beres wrote: I'm starting to love Instagram Stories more than Snapchat because I'm incredibly thirsty. I'm glugging down what Instagram is serving and I don't care anymore.\nInstagram's CEO Kevin Systrom said he doesn't think of Instagram Stories as just cloning Snapchat Stories, but considers \"Stories\" to be a desirable format for storytelling. It's like messaging. There are tons of messaging apps, but they're all fundamentally the same: you type out messages and they appear as bubbles.\nI guess that's true, but it doesn't change the fact that Instagram ripped Snapchat off.\nNobody's hanging on Skype waiting for things to get lit.\nNo doubt, the success of Instagram Stories gave Facebook the confidence to paste \"Stories\" into its other apps. In January the Facebook app added Stories. Then, in February, Facebook-owned WhatsApp got its own Stories in the form of an updated \"Status.\" And in March, Facebook Messenger also got Stories with \"Messenger Day.\"\nDespite seemingly nobody using Facebook Stories -- WhatsApp's Status has 175 million daily users and it's not clear how many people are using Messenger Day -- others are now following in Facebook's footsteps of copying Snapchat Stories.\nThe latest app to rip off Snapchat Stories is Skype with its \"Highlights\" -- yeah, Skype, the app that ushered in VoIP to the masses and is about as cool as Microsoft Word. That is, they're both still widely used, but come on, nobody's hanging on Skype waiting for things to get lit. Skype is a utility, like the telephone, and you log in to chat with a person and then you log off.\nFine, Skype's trying to reinvent itself to court the youngs. There's nothing wrong with that except I fear that this is only the beginning. By the end of the year, I expect more apps to add a \"Stories\" feature. What's next? Twitter Stories? Uber Stories? Apple Maps Stories? Apple Music Stories? \nProduct designer Rafael Conde perfectly visualized the Stories-fication of apps a few months ago:\nIntroducing Music Stories!Share selfies of you listening to music with all your friends. pic.twitter.com/nu9bxk6fMY— Rafael Conde (@rafahari) March 22, 2017\n\nIntroducing Maps Stories!Stuck in traffic? Share how bored you are with all your friends! pic.twitter.com/zhkEwJVtsS— Rafael Conde (@rafahari) March 22, 2017\n\nLMFAO. Seriously, just LMFAO.\nI cracked up when my colleague Stan Schroeder tweeted this last month:\nI bought a sandwich today and it didn’t have a “stories” feature. I demand my money back.— Stan Schroeder (@franticnews) May 5, 2017\n\nHe's not alone. Look at all these jokesters.\nStories may be the hot new thing at the moment, but you can't just force it into every app and expect people will jump onboard and lap it up. It needs to make sense. Stories, I'm sorry, Highlights, don't make any sense on Skype. Skype is not a damn social platform. It's a tunnel for connecting you to other people directly, not a nightclub like Snapchat or Instagram.\nSo, app developers. Look at your app. Does it need a Stories feature? The answer is probably no. OK then, stop it before I delete your app.\nWATCH: World travelers will love this suitcase that doubles as a scooter"},"shares":{"facebook":1427,"twitter":1083,"google_plus":24,"pinterest":6,"linked_in":444,"stumble_upon":468,"total":3452},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LMP5MWudrdMz-0HtpYoGUmeSiWs=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F496717%2F5ec6278a-ecdb-4298-aa45-bca2b2020811.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aqJfJpi4GNMsqAeFa1Lf3tdkd4M=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47566%2F255c4fc4-7e43-463c-8b5d-0f5d5d94ff26.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/56aa7BO3-5xI9Wb5L7f2Qb-UA3M=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47566%2F255c4fc4-7e43-463c-8b5d-0f5d5d94ff26.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wO5AIXBCpCYFhwoe-A778Rknv2Y=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47566%2F255c4fc4-7e43-463c-8b5d-0f5d5d94ff26.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/S-RTnWRKqjMAErr7OPU505edVpU=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47566%2F255c4fc4-7e43-463c-8b5d-0f5d5d94ff26.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WsnnYHl4LIRevEmpKYeevPLrAuE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47566%2F255c4fc4-7e43-463c-8b5d-0f5d5d94ff26.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2svjm3w","display_title":"Stop putting 'Stories' in every friggin' app","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gjnL5jDl2q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"A story for you.

But don't worry, we've kept up for you. \nSEE ALSO: You can now apply for a refund from your kids' unauthorized Amazon in-app purchases\nEach week we round up the most important app news along with some of the coolest new and updated apps to help you stay in the loop with everything you need on your phone.\nHere's what caught our eye this week.

Until now, anyone with a will found a way into your Twitter inbox. But, Twitter recently updated the messaging system by filtering DMs into two folders. Messages from people you follow will go into your 'inbox', while messages from strangers or people you don't follow will be filtered into 'requests'. \nThe update gives you the option to preview messages in requests before either accepting or deleting them. Once you accept a message, future communication from that user will go directly to your inbox and not into requests even if you still don't follow them. \nJust be sure to keep an eye on both folders to make sure you don't end up missing important information from new potential contacts. \nSlingTV makes it easier to find favorites\nLooking for a snapshot of what’s on TV? Our new grid guide makes it easy to find your show in your channel lineup! https://t.co/umNj3LLfTE pic.twitter.com/U0whVG6Gcc— Sling TV (@Sling) May 31, 2017\n\nSlingTV just announced a new feature that users have been passionately requesting. The new grid guide was the most requested change to SlingTV other than DVR. The system looks similar to TV Guide's setup and gives users a better idea of what's popular now and what they should watch. It features what's on now, filters channels by genre and shows the upcoming schedule of every channel. \nThis is currently only available on Android devices. But don't worry, iPhone users! Support for additional devices is on the way.\nSkype adds stories\nIntroducing the next generation of Skype—share, chat, and create like never before. Read more: https://t.co/6RwPZmeWGY pic.twitter.com/6JStK9LfEM— Skype (@Skype) June 1, 2017\n\nFirst we saw it on Snapchat, then on Facebook. Now even Skype has added a story-like feature called 'highlights' to its platform. Microsoft launched the latest update this week in what is the biggest change since the video sharing update in 2006. Apparently, it's been in the works for over a year, so Skype doesn't want anyone thinking it just jumped on the bandwagon after Facebook made a move. The platform will soon be adding bots and chat options to be even more similar to Facebook. \nElsewhere\nCameraBag Mobile 3 ups your Instagram game by adding the ability to auto-divide photos into square tiles.

Users have the ability to choose what they want to go into these protected media folders that no one can access without the passcode or iTouch. The app also logs out whenever it goes into the background to ensure no one gets in by accident. \nGiphy is giving GIF enthusiasts the pleasure of watching source videos. It doesn't work for every GIF at the moment though, so stay patient. Giphy is working on allowing full video viewing for GIFs that were made on YouTube and other platforms. \nAmazon made a change to let users ask Alexa to remind them of something. The reminder can be for a certain time if you want to use it that day, or can be scheduled out in advance. A blue light will appear before Alexa speaks to avoid freaking anyone out. Multiple timers can be set for different people for the same time, and all reminders can be managed in the Alexa App. \nWATCH: Capture perfect Insta-worthy underwater selfies with this bionic fish"},"shares":{"facebook":84,"google_plus":13,"pinterest":2,"linked_in":19,"twitter":435,"total":553},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xyTQZUxg0npbfABJfDVarKacNT4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47549%2Fe2c6e4f8-076a-4647-bb22-23115f545aaa.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CDs5sxuQIEkzwQpwOTZF5vx4_II=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47549%2Fe2c6e4f8-076a-4647-bb22-23115f545aaa.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nX_-8TLnHv5Db_fBwykjrqpV27M=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47549%2Fe2c6e4f8-076a-4647-bb22-23115f545aaa.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Wa0r8xnR8rtJsPAEsvOBaiWdJvQ=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47549%2Fe2c6e4f8-076a-4647-bb22-23115f545aaa.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dpuHlXvct-eMht6xd_PqK6sCCfI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47549%2Fe2c6e4f8-076a-4647-bb22-23115f545aaa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hyZZP6fS9LSbnDTnw04XtWTACDs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47549%2Fe2c6e4f8-076a-4647-bb22-23115f545aaa.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rQGQmM","display_title":"This week in apps: Twitter filters DMs, Sling TV gets grid guide and more switch it up","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"6k01p8DoVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Don't miss out on the new ways to use your favorite apps.

Every chat you have in the app now has a dedicated \"capture\" tab where you can exchange photos or snap new ones — complete, of course, with the requisite doodles and stickers — while you're texting or video chatting. \nAnd if you want to share images outside of a one-on-one or group conversation, a new \"highlights\" feature lets you blast photos of your choosing to all your contacts, just like your Story on Snapchat or Instagram (or Facebook, or WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger). \n\nSpeaking of contacts, the new Skype is also making it easier to find people you already know but may not be connected with, with a new search feature that makes it painless to find your existing contacts on the platform.\nSkype, of course, has always been a messaging app, but the latest version of the service makes the whole experience feel a lot more social. There are emoji reactions (a la Facebook) and new add-ins and bots — both of which allow you to bring third-party apps and services into your chats.\n\nMicrosoft says these these features are just the beginning. Also in the works: turn-based games in chats (ahem, Facebook), new tie-ins with Cortana and other \"intelligent\" features that leverage Skype's new in-app camera.\nThe new Skype is rolling out now on Android and will be out soon for iOS and desktop. \nWATCH: This travel adaptor works in 150 countries"},"shares":{"twitter":714,"linked_in":52,"facebook":123,"pinterest":2,"google_plus":19,"total":910},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/I47_gllb0yAcohnJwfbZyIDspZo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47332%2F3382e61c-232a-44b1-a665-f1fbac1518f5.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cjPerK4Dg4BMFS6qTifTA-zT78A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47332%2F3382e61c-232a-44b1-a665-f1fbac1518f5.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bwfDUOfrx3XdPp1_R8UaOsvCquI=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47332%2F3382e61c-232a-44b1-a665-f1fbac1518f5.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GfG6X0J8t7BHgvyydOT8_YPVFd4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47332%2F3382e61c-232a-44b1-a665-f1fbac1518f5.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z0PIxhJ8OIB16m1q2QT7s3r8BaM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47332%2F3382e61c-232a-44b1-a665-f1fbac1518f5.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/icVYulJUaTtGux2v_mQk7qesGlk=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47332%2F3382e61c-232a-44b1-a665-f1fbac1518f5.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2qESDju","display_title":"Microsoft just gave Skype a Snapchat-style makeover","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gjnL5j5l2q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Microsoft just gave Skype its biggest redesign in more than a decade.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Microsoft just gave Skype a Snapchat-style makeover"},{"_id":"590c2e7228cc3662be000509","id":"2017/05/05/microsoft-bing-search-bots","title":"Microsoft's Bing wants you to chat with search results","title_tag":null,"author":"Freia Lobo","post_date":"2017-05-05T07:49:03+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 05 May 2017 07:49:03 +0000","formatted_date":"05/05/2017","formatted_shares":"888","sort_key":"1D6Gdm","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/05/microsoft-bing-search-bots/","content":{"plain":"Microsoft is testing developer tools that allow chatbots directly in Bing's search results. Reports of the tests in Seattle and surrounding areas have been around for at least a month. The bots are powered by Skype.\n\nThe bots are currently limited to a handful of locations. Searching for a participating location reveals an option to ask the bot for help directly in the browser, as with El Gaucho (pictured above). The bots can answer basic queries about the location's parking info, hours, and more via both buttons as well as natural language input. \nSEE ALSO: Whoa, Microsoft just beat Apple in tablet satisfaction\nThe conference schedule for Build, the company's upcoming developer conference, also features a session that mentions \"you can add your custom bots to Bing,\" The Verge pointed out. Sources familiar with the company told The Verge that Microsoft is ready to further expand the feature.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has articulated the company's focus on bots. Previous attempts include Tay, an experimental Twitter conversation bot that quickly turned racist, Xiaoice, which the company calls \"Cortana's little sister,\" and of course, Cortana, the company's AI assistant.\nRolling chatbots out to Bing would be a huge expansion into one of the company's largest consumer-facing products. Chatbots in search are an interesting idea as Microsoft continues to innovate and compete with Google, the dominant search engine. Both search engines have shifted to focus on delivering answers directly to search queries and adding something like chatbots could help that goal.\nWATCH: Someone staged military rationed food as Michelin-starred plates"},"shares":{"google_plus":23,"facebook":268,"twitter":550,"linked_in":41,"pinterest":6,"total":888},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fJvhTQAvMl2ZLt8tUUvgyFXb35c=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F467748%2Fd9185b79-a589-4dba-a134-de50f3c99a85.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/N3kSpXONgStoj4_xOAzv1NoF2rU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44809%2F35a07785-42e9-4ccc-98a9-f636a233884b.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WGAnlVFNEQgmz5MUbFa686__fis=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44809%2F35a07785-42e9-4ccc-98a9-f636a233884b.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PrcyVqTmwWJgxZVA-gJ8OonyMCU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44809%2F35a07785-42e9-4ccc-98a9-f636a233884b.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RgaQQt7mvfAZxHs1OfHsaq3L1Mo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44809%2F35a07785-42e9-4ccc-98a9-f636a233884b.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zffNpofb2H-4IquOOKvk737FCtg=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44809%2F35a07785-42e9-4ccc-98a9-f636a233884b.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pcptH2","display_title":"Microsoft's Bing wants you to chat with search results","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"6k01A6x0Vb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Get your questions answered directly in search.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Microsoft's Bing wants you to chat with search results"},{"_id":"58e7c44a28cc363e8400062d","id":"2017/04/07/skype-translator-adds-japanese","title":"Skype adds Japanese to its real-time voice translator","title_tag":null,"author":"Nicole Gallucci","post_date":"2017-04-07T16:54:31+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Apr 2017 16:54:31 +0000","formatted_date":"04/07/2017","formatted_shares":"869","sort_key":"1CWzd8","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/04/07/skype-translator-adds-japanese/","content":{"plain":"Skype Translator, the communication platform's real-time voice translator, just reached a new milestone.

Instead, according to the participants we've talked to, it's the White House who's doing much of the choosing.\n\"It just came out of the blue, really.\"\nOf the first 15 reporters to ask questions from the Skype seats in press briefings between Feb. 1 and Feb. 22, 2017, we spoke to six who were either contacted by deputy members of the White House press office or given a seat after reaching out to the press office, sometimes for an unrelated interview.\nJohn Huck, from Las Vegas's local Fox affiliate KVVU, received an email from a member of the press office that suggested he was chosen from a database stemming from his coverage of primary debates in Nevada. \"It just came out of the blue, really. We had not reached out to the White House to see if we could get a seat,\" he said.\nLars Larson, a conservative radio host from Oregon, said the White House press team gave his show a call about participating in the Skype seats and he jumped at the chance. Larson noted his show has had an \"open channel\" with Trump's team thanks to previous interviews with members of the team, including multiple chats with Trump. \nAnd Kim Kalunian, of Providence, Rhode Island's local CBS affiliate WPRI, interviewed Sean Spicer, who spent much of his life in Rhode Island, in December 2016, ahead of the inauguration and was called by White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters inviting her to ask one of the first questions from a Skype seat because of those \"home\" state ties. \nThe White House press office didn't respond to multiple requests for comment about the secret process or whether it will be opened up in the future. \nThe issue of transparency\nWho is being picked isn't as big a concern as how they're being picked, said Ellen Shearer, head of the Medill School of Journalism's Washington program. \"Even of the reporters who are at the daily, Sean Spicer decides who he will call on, so in that sense, they control who gets to ask the questions and they always have.\"\nThe press secretary picking reporters is not new to the Trump administration, of course. It has been standard practice for quite some time. But for those reporters, the established credentialing process is public while, at this point, there's no rhyme or reason as to how the White House chooses the Skype participants. \n\"I think the lack of transparency in how they're selecting those who get to ask the question is troubling,\" Shearer adds, \"particularly given the president's comments about the press and Steve Bannon's comments about the press.\"  \nIndeed, Trump's administration has antagonized the press, whether it's denying access to certain organizations, calling only on conservative outlets, or calling mainstream media outlets  \"fake news\" and the \"enemy of the American people.\" \nBrendan Fitzgerald, associate editor for the Columbia Journalism Review, mentioned the less-than cordial relationship between the media and the Trump administration as a reason that they should want to be more transparent. \n\"When you have a White House administration that offers such a critical perspective on the media, it might be hard for voters across the country to know which news sources they ought to trust, and why.\"\n\"When you have a White House administration that offers its critical perspective on the media, it might do well for that same administration to offer some comment as to why certain people join the press briefings via Skype,\" he said, \"It might also reward the American people to know a bit about what that process looks like.\" \nFitzgerald, who took a deep look at the first round of Skype seats for CJR, also noted that a lack of transparency could make the viewing public more skeptical towards the media outlets asking the Skype questions. \n\"I think making the Skype seat application an open process would be more transparent. When you have a White House administration that offers such a critical perspective on the media, it might be hard for voters across the country to know which news sources they ought to trust, and why. \n\"And when the process for bringing a new, arguably more diverse group of reporters into the briefing room is opaque,\" he continued, \"then anyone watching those briefings might watch them with great skepticism.\" \nShearer shared the same sentiment, saying, \"I think it would make a lot of sense for them to have people apply in a way that would list everybody who has asked to be Skyped in. That way, we'd be able to see who's asked and who's been allowed in.\" This would make it easier to see which outlets have been called on and which have been ignored, just like in the actual press briefing room.  \nAnother problem with the Skype seats is the inability to ask a follow-up question or a chance to push back on a spokesperson's answer. Indeed, some of Spicer's answers have been lackluster but the reporter is cut off before they get a chance to push for a better answer.\nWPRI's Kalunian said, \"It's a little harder when you're there via Skype and not actually sitting in that room to be able to say 'But-but-but you're not really answering my question.' If they could allow for a follow-up from the Skype reporters, it'd be even more valuable.\"\nFitzgerald agreed, \"If there's no ability to follow-up, what do we learn from that exchange?\"  \nThe diversity of voices\nStill, despite issues with transparency and accountability, the program has so far been successful in regards to covering a variety of topics and opening up the diversity of voices in the briefings. \nOut of the 15 questions asked via Skype during the first four briefings in which the seats were used, nine came from reporters for television stations (all network affiliates), four from radio hosts, one from a print publication, and one from an online source.\n\nThere's no apparent geographical favoritism, either, as five questions have come from states Hillary Clinton won in 2016 and seven questions have come from states Trump won. Interestingly, the only two states that have been represented multiple times so far are the key swing states of Ohio (three) and Florida (two).\nMost of the questions have been of a quality deserving of the press briefing setting, addressing national issues from a local perspective. Immigration has been the favorite topic so far with five questions from the Skype seats pertaining to immigration or sanctuary city issues. \n\nOther topics have included the economy, coal, federal regulations, the opioid epidemic, and relations with Cuba, which are all relevant news topics that resonate with viewers around the country. \nIt's also been a success in the eyes of the participants we spoke to, as it has enabled them to get answers from the White House on major issues that resonate with their own local audiences that may not be at the forefront of the D.C. press corp's minds.\n\"I think it's a good concept,\" said Jeff Jobe, owner of six county newspapers in Kentucky and the lone Skype questioner from a print outlet so far. \"I think to continually focus on the same two or three stories every week is an injustice to the people who want to know what's going on.\" \n\nLars Larson, the conservative talk radio host, believes both sides of the political aisle deserve air time and that an outsider's point of view can circumvent the press corp's bubble. \n\"If you simply get people from outside [Washington D.C] and those people use that opportunity not to just ask another question on Obamacare,\" Larson said. \"If you get somebody from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle or Denver or Houston, they are likely to ask a question that shows a point of view outside that beltway mentality.\"\n\"I felt like the Washington press corp, they have the information, they have their sources, they know how to get what they need out of Spicer. I need to stay in my lane and talk about what I think is relevant to Nevadans,\" said KVVU's John Huck.\nHaving a direct line to the White House is also a new advantage for many outlets, according to Jackie Nespral, of Miami's NBC 6, \"It was a great experience because to give an opportunity to a local reporter to ask a question of the spokesperson -- you're essentially getting the word from the administration.\" \nHandling the softball\nBut who gets that direct line is still the primary issue. Although the questions have so far been diverse, there's still the threat that handpicking reporters could lead to softball questions and one Skype seat incident has already demonstrated that issue. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer was criticized when, in the midst of questions about Gen. Michael Flynn's resignation, he took a Skype question on regulation rollbacks from Jason Stevens, of the Federalist Papers website that featured some editorializing from Stevens. \nYou can watch it here:\n\nIf a White House that complains of media bias then fields an explicitly biased question from an outlet it hand-picked, with no accounting for why that outlet was picked, the entire point of the press briefings is undermined. It's no longer an issue of the free press but, rather, propaganda.\nStacking the deck with Skype seats in this manner is another way to retain control of the media's access and undermines the progress the White House has made through the program. It's going to take responsibility and transparency to ensure that the Skype seats continue to be a productive experience.\nWhether this administration is up to the task of improving the experience becomes harder to guess the longer they stay silent on the process. And shrouding the selection process in secrecy -- a secrecy that Medill's Shearer calls \"needless\" -- only underscores the administration's nefarious dealings with the media and its ongoing attempts to destabilize the press's credibility by manipulating the norms and condition under which the two sides usually operate. \nIf their intentions are good, even if with more pro-Trump voices in the room, then shed light on the process. Otherwise, an initiative that's meant to increase that diversity of voices will bring more skepticism, eroding any goodwill the whole thing was meant to deliver in the first place.\nBONUS: Sean Spicer just cannot get the Prime Minister of Australia's name right"},"shares":{"twitter":523,"facebook":344,"google_plus":6,"linked_in":6,"pinterest":1,"total":880},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9gGK1228FEKwCD8C-gaiU9QDk3U=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F390639%2Ff796ce6b-4f06-4986-9f6f-b087c18d8908.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RWhs80cU5nr22wAkwtaQIko-p18=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36951%2Ffc61030c-3d9a-4f19-b36e-ed80fefdd808.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6C4zzEU9CEmmfA_BXnhxzVAq4To=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36951%2Ffc61030c-3d9a-4f19-b36e-ed80fefdd808.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bSlAi5YbM_JHsvciGhncg88ArQM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36951%2Ffc61030c-3d9a-4f19-b36e-ed80fefdd808.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Lq0bu-6mqC6iltrKWUbxfOjKgoY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36951%2Ffc61030c-3d9a-4f19-b36e-ed80fefdd808.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZwgTeNakcvv2yuCrBZG0ChGxX4A=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36951%2Ffc61030c-3d9a-4f19-b36e-ed80fefdd808.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2muuY78","display_title":"Inside the shadowy Skype seat selection process","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Emlj1VGnL6","data-source":"blueprint"},{"data-slug":"gb0evMBnLd","data-source":"blueprint"},{"data-id":"oz7nk03S","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"A great idea to diversify voices in White House press briefings still has a big transparency hurdle.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Inside the shadowy Skype seat selection process"},{"_id":"58ad2ca9f11b2c5e76000255","id":"2017/02/22/skype-lite-aadhaar-india-stack","title":"Microsoft launches Skype Lite for India that works on slow internet and supports Aadhaar","title_tag":null,"author":"Manish Singh","post_date":"2017-02-22T06:16:04+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 06:16:04 +0000","formatted_date":"02/22/2017","formatted_shares":"1.0k","sort_key":"1CGqVt","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/22/skype-lite-aadhaar-india-stack/","content":{"plain":"Microsoft has just found the perfect Skype app for the Indian market. \nAt an event in Mumbai today, Satya Nadella announced Skype Lite, a 13MB app that works even on slower networks and on lower-end phones with limited storage and processing power. \nSEE ALSO: Facebook's 'Lite' app for developing areas now has 200 million monthly users\nOn top of this, Skype Lite leverages Aadhaar, India's biometric database, as its \"fundamental authentication system,\" Nadella said. \"We're very excited about what we are doing with Skype, and the India Stack (the infrastructure of Aadhaar that allows private companies to interact with the database).\"\nThe company is positioning Skype Lite, available on Android starting today, as a single-app for all sorts of communication -- \"messaging, calling, sharing,\" a company executive said on stage. For instance, much like earlier version of Google Hangouts, the text messages and IM chats appear in the same app. \nMicrosoft has also introduced bots to the messaging app and added automated services such as MSN News. The bots, much like in Google Assistant, are able to predict what it is that you're likely to type and fetch information for you. Additionally, Skype Lite uses machine learning to de-clutter spam messages.\n\nBut more importantly, Skype Lite offers Aadhaar authentication, and allows either of the callers to request for other's verification. The verification works like this: a user could ask from within the app while a call is underway to check for the verification of the other person. The other person will be prompted to enter their 12-digit unique Aadhaar number and a one time password they received on their phone.\nThe company said this feature could come in handy in scenarios such as online job interview where either of the parties may find it necessary to have some sort of verification method. The company assured that it deletes all the Aadhaar data once the call has been disconnected. \nLaunched in 2009, Aadhaar has grown to become the world's largest biometric database. Over 1.1 billion --  99 percent of all adults -- have enrolled to the system. Though Aadhaar has made it faster and ever to verify a user's identity, it comes with its own set of problems.\n\nBONUS: Check out WhatsApp's new Statuses"},"shares":{"linked_in":121,"twitter":618,"google_plus":25,"facebook":268,"pinterest":3,"total":1035},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jDTpVvbDjdCqKum_ZhSw0PYQCHo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F391009%2F98006ed4-b9f2-41a7-87c9-4b59adb12130.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eovYT0-kVcJLHaGTooMU39n7Y18=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37533%2F057e3e22-3de7-43ce-812d-9d53399f7fd4.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hbxFhlvmYLUaQ3bdPkMrJfpDwv4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37533%2F057e3e22-3de7-43ce-812d-9d53399f7fd4.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_uZ5qV1IaBuEzMXkbsJA9qVJoZk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37533%2F057e3e22-3de7-43ce-812d-9d53399f7fd4.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uN4QHnuRTJsNlCUj11vzwqF6OJA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37533%2F057e3e22-3de7-43ce-812d-9d53399f7fd4.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wDISemXgEKSULnLsAs1eirS0erg=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37533%2F057e3e22-3de7-43ce-812d-9d53399f7fd4.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2mkhJlc","display_title":"Microsoft launches Skype Lite for India that works on slow internet and supports Aadhaar","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"iJLqC7ZV","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The app is made for India.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Microsoft launches Skype Lite for India that works on slow internet and supports Aadhaar"},{"_id":"58a4ab409111ae6c79000100","id":"2017/02/15/amazon-google-home-phone","title":"Amazon and Google may bring back home phones","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-02-15T19:25:49+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 19:25:49 +0000","formatted_date":"02/15/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1CE84K","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/15/amazon-google-home-phone/","content":{"plain":"When was the last time you actually talked to someone on a home phone? It's no secret that landline phone service is on the way out — a recent survey found over half of American households had ditched their home phones — but home-based phone service might not be dead just yet. \nIf a report from the Wall Street Journal holds any weight, home telecommunication is just evolving. After a series of comments from anonymous Amazon and Google sources, it looks like the companies are making moves to offer their smart home speaker hubs, Amazon's Echo and Google's Home, as phone line replacements. \nSEE ALSO: New low-power chips could put voice control everywhere\nThe shift to phone service via smart assistant makes sense. Both systems are based on vocal interactions with AI systems — so why shouldn't they be able to host conversations with a real person over the internet? WSJ's sources claim Amazon has been developing a phone feature for the Echo since 2015, while Google already has an online telecommunication platform, Google Voice, which could possibly be integrated into the Home device. \nWith those systems already in development, the sources report both Google and Amazon could launch phone service on their devices by the end of the year. That said, the rollout is stalled until some logistical problems are addressed.  \n\nFirst order of business: addressing consumer anxiety about their calls being recorded. Both the Echo and Home record audio interactions already — but adding the extra wrinkle of personal conversations to the mix could make consumers extra leery of Big Brother listening in.  \nTo quell fears, the sources claim Amazon's service would only collect the metadata from each call, not the actual conversations. Google's privacy solution wasn't as clear, but if it runs on the Google Voice protocol, it would only record the metadata as well, along with SMS messages, voicemails and user-recorded calls. \nThe Echo and Home would probably use voice over internet protocol tech (VoIP), the internet calling  system used by Skype and Vonage, which sources say could be roped in to bring their services directly to smart home hubs. \nGoogle and Amazon are also reportedly looking to solve issues that could come with the digital assistants' keywords in conversation — just imagine how complicated it could get on a phone call to a friend named Alexa — and how exactly ending calls and managing contact lists will be handled.  \n\nOn a more serious note, how to possibly integrate emergency calling and 911 service presents another roadblock. Having a voice-based assistant that can act as a phone could be extremely helpful in an emergency, but most online telephony services don't allow 911 calls. \nGiving law enforcement access to the lines for wiretapping is an issue, too — a warrant for audio information from an Amazon Echo was already part of a contentious investigation last year, and Amazon refused to turn over records to authorities. With real-time communications involved and established federal laws in place for existing telephone systems, it's a messy issue that needs a deft hand to solve.      \nWhen these hurdles are cleared, there's little doubt that Google and Amazon will be eager to roll out the home calling systems as yet another reason to bring their smart assistants into your home. Before you get too excited about using your Echo to talk to someone other than Alexa, it's important to keep in mind that all these details are still unconfirmed — Amazon reps wouldn't comment on our requests for clarification on the story, and Google is yet to respond.    \nBONUS: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"twitter":632,"facebook":288,"pinterest":4,"google_plus":155,"linked_in":76,"total":1155},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7Ti9HvLzBxYEW99wSDhNmRLt9SA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F384947%2F77cc2f79-1971-41e9-9c78-841fc5867bd1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OJWHrvuOS_EVi5DUSUJBH688WyU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36954%2F1187d3ad-39fa-4d55-8da5-af16b6a2be30.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/as29Ne6SHf1wAhav1F3qa6XTTXM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36954%2F1187d3ad-39fa-4d55-8da5-af16b6a2be30.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/F7KyFXZajJq2XA3ViPZWt4pjqqA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36954%2F1187d3ad-39fa-4d55-8da5-af16b6a2be30.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aFAKmqCACLxO4uu995PzqVcMPD0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36954%2F1187d3ad-39fa-4d55-8da5-af16b6a2be30.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/i63m3ZbcBpbsA7nVqq3b-iKHeXE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36954%2F1187d3ad-39fa-4d55-8da5-af16b6a2be30.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2kTtlOi","display_title":"Amazon and Google may bring back home phones","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"Bzghp05d","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Alexa and Assistant could be your next home phone.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Amazon and Google may bring back home phones"},{"_id":"58a36b1d28cc36137500000c","id":"2017/02/14/sean-spicer-press-briefing-skype-seats-twitter","title":"Twitter has a field day roasting Sean Spicer's softball Skype questions","title_tag":null,"author":"Sasha Lekach","post_date":"2017-02-14T20:39:54+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 20:39:54 +0000","formatted_date":"02/14/2017","formatted_shares":"2.1k","sort_key":"1CDOx7","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/14/sean-spicer-press-briefing-skype-seats-twitter/","content":{"plain":"When things get tough at the White House's daily press briefings, Press Secretary Sean Spicer turns to his new Skype seats.\nSEE ALSO: Hundreds of people are trolling Sean Spicer on Venmo\nThe questions that come in via video chat have been derided as softballs ever since they were included in the daily meetings at the beginning of the month.

Most meeting applications or services are hard to use, deliver bad audio and video, require constant switching between multiple tools to do everything they want, and are way too expensive,” Amazon Web Services Vice President for Enterprise Applications Gene Farrell said in a statement. “Amazon Chime delivers frustration-free meetings, allowing users to be productive from anywhere. And with no ongoing maintenance or management fees, Amazon Chime is a great choice for companies that are looking for a solution to meetings that their employees will love to use.”\nChime is provided by Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing and storage division that makes up a big chunk of Amazon's business. The online meeting tool lets users switch between Mac, Windows, iOS and Android devices to use video-conferencing, screen-sharing, file-sharing and a chat feature. \nAmazon has long targeted business with its cloud computing offerings, but Chime is one of its first forays into productivity software. \nChime costs $2.50 per month per user for a plan with screen sharing and use of a corporate directory, and $15 per month per user for a full plan that offers video meetings for up to 100 people — the version most businesses will need. A basic plan that allows video calls for two people and chat features is free. \nMeetings set up through Chime will call users, prompting them to either join or say they're running late with one click. Each meeting has a virtual roster that shows who has joined and who is running late. Users can mute background noise and will be automatically reconnected if they get dropped from the meeting. \nThe service works both within companies and for meetings between different organizations. \nSince Chime is provided by the security-focused Amazon Web Services, the video-conferencing tool encrypts all communications and doesn't store chat history. Chime runs through the AWS cloud. \nThe firms Level 3 Communications and Vonage will both offer Chime to their business customers. \nCan Amazon take down Skype?

The two companies have collaborated on an in-car solution to this office absentee problem: integrating Skype for Business in a Volvo car.\nSEE ALSO: 10 tech trends that will rule CES 2017\nMaybe Volvo should take most of the blame... er... credit since it's the one integrating existing business communication technology in its 90 Series cars.\nThe application will appear on the automobile's huge in-dash touchscreen, connecting to your smartphone to complete the call. Mashable was promised a hands-on demo of Skype integration later this week. We'll report back on our findings.\nIn a press release on the new technology, which will be on display this week at CES, Anders Tylman-Mikiewicz Volvo's vice president of consumer connectivity services explained his company's fascination with making group meetings happen when you're on the go this way, “We’ve all been there. Sitting in the car trying to join a conference call. You either fumble with or drop your phone while trying to connect or you forget the long PIN code to join. It’s not the best way to start an important call in the car. On top of all that your attention is not where it should be -- on the road. With the addition of Skype for Business all that goes away.\"\n\nAlong with Skype for Business, Microsoft is also bringing its digital voice assistant, Cortana, to Volvos, which means the cars will get voice recognition and access to Cortana's Bing- and AI-based intelligence. Perhaps you'll not only be able to attend meetings while in your Volvo, but have all the answers, too. \nMaybe being able to attend all those meetings no matter where you are isn't such a bad thing.\nBONUS: This 'Captain America' trailer assembles the Avengers with homemade magic"},"shares":{"twitter":609,"facebook":140,"google_plus":13,"total":762},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BD5Wgy1vpkZLcIlSPPoronANKDc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334075%2F68d92dcb-f2a5-4ba3-b082-41260ea87a6e.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Tvr32fkQShFYK8SbV_3JN-kCVbQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32251%2F922b77c2-41c9-461d-be0f-3b49170afd05.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SSwkYG7mkhKdBDoTGBfkR-ty9G0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32251%2F922b77c2-41c9-461d-be0f-3b49170afd05.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zF2qKXMktIXKiaEuJS1FPsL0TJo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32251%2F922b77c2-41c9-461d-be0f-3b49170afd05.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/G9ErrXKlkGnlQjEESAkry8x19tI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32251%2F922b77c2-41c9-461d-be0f-3b49170afd05.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AJxG8LhOnr-3ykg7jVhioXLg4Bo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32251%2F922b77c2-41c9-461d-be0f-3b49170afd05.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2i6GVdr","display_title":"Volvo wants you to never miss a meeting again.

To add to their woes, alternative messenger apps were also not easy to find.\nSEE ALSO: In an instant messaging world, a delayed response is anxiety inducing\nWhatsApp stopped working on a range of older smartphones on the New Year’s Eve. The Facebook-owned messaging app no longer supports smartphones running Android 2.2 Froyo, or older versions of Android, iPhones running iOS 6 or older, as well as the handful of smartphones running Windows Phone 7 or earlier version.\nAlthough these are quite old operating systems — Android 2.2, for instance, was released in 2010 — many people still use smartphones that cannot be upgraded to a newer version. And as a result of this, they have lost access to WhatsApp.\nWhatsApp is used by more than one billion users every month, as of February 2016. The app is quite popular worldwide, but in emerging markets such as that of India, it's nearly ubiquitous. As of November last year, over 160 million Indian users were reliant on the messenger. \nIt's going to be a tough ride finding an instant messaging app that still supports ancient phones. \nLast year, WhatsApp said it was a difficult decision for the company to cut access to older devices, but insisted that older mobile operating systems don't \"offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.\"\nWhatsApp has matured over the years, picking up sophisticated and understandably resource-rich features such as voice calling, and video calling. From a security stand point, it has pushed end-to-end encryption and other improvements to all its users.\nPerhaps Android manufacturers should be blamed for some of this. Their \"policy\" to not push new software updates to existing Android-powered devices after a specific interval of time continues to strand millions of customers out of support cycle every month. In case of smaller brands and low-cost devices, the support life cycle is often shorter. \nAbout 0.1 percent of all Android devices still run Android 2.2. While that number may seem minuscule, it still amounts to a lot of Android devices. As of September 2015, there were about 1.4 billion active Android devices. That roughly translates to 1.4 million devices running Android 2.2 version. \nWhatsApp will also kill support for devices running BlackBerry 10 OS, or Nokia S40, or Nokia Symbian S60 operating system this June. The company had previously planned to cut support for these platforms at the end of 2016 as well, but later it gave them a little more time.  \nUsers on affected platforms could try other instant messaging services, but finding one that still supports their device is going to be a tough quest. \nTelegram, for instance, has also quietly pulled support for Android smartphones running versions older than 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Facebook Messenger, also doesn’t likely support these older mobile operating system versions anymore.\nMicrosoft's Skype, similarly, doesn’t support Android devices running Android versions older than 4.0.3, and iPhones running iOS 7. Perhaps purchasing a new smartphone is the bet for people to continue to operate in this increasingly growing digital age.\nBONUS: WhatsApp’s Push-to-Talk Features and Other News you Need to Know\n\n "},"shares":{"facebook":622,"twitter":949,"google_plus":33,"total":1604},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OwbTXck2AIn1K4IgOJPgUtrwCIk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334281%2Fc3e374f5-7973-4b07-8932-9dd28ae2f546.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jxgAKnNdxtE91VGtoj2CsYGRYXc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fBaYhOaGeQB87McejZ_pfGwwFSk=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bQV14gDw-8v0367IulJil4z4kPM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PcHdUJdwHiqKH9wywGRdP9rXjC0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WdL2cB1bGK0pQuoB7Bs39uFstWI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ixTKhT","display_title":"Older smartphones get locked out of WhatsApp","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"RHzNFtir","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Time to upgrade.

With a new update, you'll be able to call people around the world and have your conversation interpreted instantaneously — even if they're using the last remaining rotary phone still in service.   \nSEE ALSO: Video calling on WhatsApp is a bigger deal than just a new feature\nThe real-time verbal translation tool, which debuted as a preview back in 2014, had been previously limited to Skype-to-Skype calls. With the latest version of Skype Preview, conversations between a Skype account and mobile phones or even landlines will now be accessible for the verbal translation.  \n\nWindows Insider Program members (which is free to join and open to the public) will be the first to have access to the new feature. With the Skype Preview software downloaded and updated, all that's needed to make the international and landline calls is either sufficient Skype credit or a full-on subscription to the service. \nWhen placing a call, users just need to set their language of choice and the tool will take care of the rest. The person on the other end of the line will hear a message stating that the call is being recorded and translated through the service, which will be very clear once the conversation begins. \nMost of the developments to Translator up until now had been focused on bringing more languages into the fold, with Mandarin Chinese coming onboard in April 2015 and Arabic debuting earlier this year. To date, nine spoken languages are supported: English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin Chinese, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic and Russian.\nThe new version of Skype Preview will also give users new options to share contact details with other users, offline video messaging, the ability to mark conversations as read or unread and Skype call forwarding to a mobile or landline number. \nThis new feature will open up Skype's translation service to an even wider network, and its potential could be endless. From family members making calls across oceans to journalists interviewing sources in remote areas, we'll soon be able to understand each other a little bit better — even without an internet connection.  \nBONUS: Skype's Translator can do real-time translation"},"shares":{"facebook":176,"twitter":422,"pinterest":1,"linked_in":38,"google_plus":13,"total":650},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SpkSaUCZ2uZ-CCeBUHOEFjxkk5Q=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F315315%2FTranslator_Video_W_Transcpt1.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TjF0wNqbUmLJ7pRt_owdB94fXvE=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30637%2FTranslator_Video_W_Transcpt1.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_nPHEw6fOwyY2tdTGuDa8x9exwE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30637%2FTranslator_Video_W_Transcpt1.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ydEZWNnsL2eFWijOgzaHm5ZtBrs=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30637%2FTranslator_Video_W_Transcpt1.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XFX_28H-1sGx3gz_Gn3iENVBGgo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30637%2FTranslator_Video_W_Transcpt1.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YuTVd-IoRcRYYjjs1ZXdxc8xF1I=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30637%2FTranslator_Video_W_Transcpt1.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2gx3Vph","display_title":"Skype is bringing real-time translation to all calls — even on old school rotary phones","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"MboWbRgl8e","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Move translation beyond the computer screen.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Skype is bringing real-time translation to all calls — even on old school rotary phones"},{"_id":"582a97406df61207a100007e","id":"2016/11/15/whatsapp-video-calling","title":"WhatsApp will finally have video calling for everyone","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2016-11-15T05:04:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 05:04:00 +0000","formatted_date":"11/15/2016","formatted_shares":"4.3k","sort_key":"1C6zUG","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/11/15/whatsapp-video-calling/","content":{"plain":"WhatsApp is finally adding one of its most-requested features.\nThe chat app will soon support free video calling, the company announced Monday.

While Build is aimed primarily at developers, Microsoft did announce a few new updates for Windows 10 and its HoloLens augmented-reality headset, the Xbox One and more.There's a lot to unpack from the two-hour long event. Here are the most important announcements from Build 2016 if you didn't tune in.SEE ALSO: 8 Microsoft Word features that will take you to the next levelWindows 10Since its release last year, Windows 10 has been a smashing success, at least based on the numbers. There are now 270 million devices running the new operating system. Building on that success, Microsoft showed off an update to the OS called Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which will come with 1,000 new features.Windows Hello, a feature in Windows 10 that lets you log into your computer with your face or fingerprint, is also spreading to the Microsoft Edge web browser. And developers will be able to build Hello support into their apps and websites, letting users ditch passwords on devices with the right hardware.As a way to court Linux users, Windows 10 is getting the Bash shell, a Linux command line.The Windows 10 Anniversary Update goes to developers now, but general users won't get it until summer.Windows InkBryan Roper, AKA awesome \"Fedora Guy,\" who was a huge hit at Microsoft's Surface Book event last fall, returned for the Build 2016 keynote to talk about Windows Ink's powerful new features for Surface tablets.In one demo, Roper showed off how it's possible to bring up a digital ruler and draw a straight line right on its edge. In another demo, he drew two points on a map and connected them with a line and the software intelligently detected the distance between them. Windows Ink will launch as part of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update this summer.Universal Windows appsSlowly, but surely, more Universal Windows Apps (UWA) are coming. Facebook's going to release new universal versions of its Facebook, Messenger and Instagram apps for Windows 10. Because they're universal, developers will only have to build one version of the app and it'll work across all devices (PCs, tablets, and smartphones).CortanaTo date, Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant, has answered over 5 billion questions from Windows 10 users, according to Microsoft. That's a lot.In the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Cortana will gain some new capabilities. It'll work on the lock screen, have tighter integration with the Outlook and calendar apps and automatically submit expenses it recognizes within emails, to name a few. Skype is also getting Cortana support, letting you do more things, like book a trip, through third-party bot integration.Xbox OneThanks to Windows 10, Xbox One and PC gaming are going to become closer than ever before. With Windows 10, you'll be able to stream Xbox One games directly to a PC. Not only that, but you'll be able to get cross-platform support for services like Steam, which will let users Xbox users chat with PC users. Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, announced the ability for all Xbox One owners to turn their consoles into development kits. Now anyone with an Xbox can develop Xbox One games. Previously, you needed an Xbox One developer kit to do so.HoloLensHoloLens, Microsoft's holographic/augmented-reality headset announced last year, got a couple of minutes of stage time. Pamela Davis, the dean for Case Western University's school of medicine showed off how medical students can use HoloLens to examine and learn about the human anatomy.Skype is also coming to HoloLens. But it's not what you think. Skype won't project holographic versions of your body; it'll just be a screen floating in front of you. (Not nearly as cool as the holoportation demo Microsoft showed last week.)HoloLens ships to developers starting on Wednesday. The developer kits, as previously announced, cost $3,000.Have something to add to this story?

As with the other Skype Translator languages, the translation you see will change in real time as the other person is speaking. That's because for each word of a sentence that's spoken, the translation software becomes more confident in a sentence's meaning and is able to make adjustments in real time.\n\nArabic joins English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, Italian and Portuguese (Brazilian) in Skype's growing lineup of languages. Microsoft says that adding Arabic was particularly important to the company as it could help migrating families, nonprofit organizations and other groups who need to speak to people in the 22 countries where Arabic is the official language,\n\nThose who have downloaded the Skype Translator Preview, can find Arabic in the app's language settings.\n\nThough the tool is ready to use now, it is still in preview so the translations won't be perfect. In two demos I saw of the software, Translator appeared to handle basic conversations well, but sometimes stumbled with more complex sentences or misheard words. (In one case it mistook the word \"bye\" for \"vine,\" while in another conversation it appeared to substitute \"Crown Princess\" for \"England.\")\n\nStill, as we've noted previously, Skype Translator is impressively quick and effective overall.

Microsoft also announced free group video calling and made its real-time translation tool available to all Windows users. \n\nBonus: The 9 best productivity apps for iPhone of all time"},"shares":{"facebook":164,"linked_in":341,"twitter":964,"google_plus":15,"pinterest":3,"total":1487},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Le3Jj4JwoIUl7sieWDEfV8_-v94=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2016%2F01%2F15%2Ff7%2Fslackmsft.c0865.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nVJoFV-Q1Iyc1xAYKeB-GgSA078=/1438x0/2016%2F01%2F15%2Ff7%2Fslackmsft.c0865.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tfLIpDahepTvI27OsTXQ6VfCpPI=/356x205/2016%2F01%2F15%2Ff7%2Fslackmsft.c0865.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n_F362DAa8DYu0TuLf_LlwlZy7w=/712x410/2016%2F01%2F15%2Ff7%2Fslackmsft.c0865.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/i548Ad9fzQPGYqwNV4b4FKQVNOQ=/280x157/2016%2F01%2F15%2Ff7%2Fslackmsft.c0865.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9txRsHxfo3K2T_Eog6RbkyrDcm8=/560x314/2016%2F01%2F15%2Ff7%2Fslackmsft.c0865.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/20331h7","display_title":"You can now make Skype voice and video calls from Slack","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2016/01/12/skype-free-group-video-calling/"}],"gallery":[{"data-id":25416,"class":"content-gallery"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}]},"excerpt":"Microsoft introduced a new integration between Skype and Slack Thursday, which allows teams to make Skype calls from within Slack threads.

The company partnered with a variety of major movie studios for clips.\n\nSee also: Do babies know the difference between Skyping and watching 'Sesame Street'?\n\nThe studios partnered with Skype are: Universal Studios, BBC and Disney — with clips from Dr. Who, Muppets, Despicable Me, Pitch Perfect and others featured.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Skype is basically doing what the internet has been doing for years with GIFs, but with the blessings of the content creators themselves. GIFs are widely distributed across the web without any royalties going to the production studio that created them.\n\nFacebook's Messenger app already has a host of integrated apps that let users share GIFs amongst each other, including Camoji, Giphy and others.\n\nThis is very reflective of the nature of competition between messaging apps. It's quite a task to set one messenger apart from another when they all offer essentially the same service. \n\nDespite Skype's ubiquitousness in video chatting, it has to contend with Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, Google's Hangouts, Twitter, LinkedIn and more picture-focused services like Snapchat and Instagram. \n\nEveryone has a messaging app, so it becomes increasingly hard for those apps to stand out on features alone. Small additions, like Skpye Mojis, are designed to be that slight edge that sets one app apart from its competition.\n\nIf you want to add Mojis to your Skype, it's as simple as downloading the latest version of the app. Skype promises to add more content in the future."},"shares":{"twitter":528,"facebook":79,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":36,"total":655},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5zWSlPKOPlKUYWE-ghJYsRbVVC0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F09%2F15%2F4e%2FMeettheMoji.28eb4.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MxrpCc4y4VSmF8yN3QJR7vhajDI=/1438x0/2015%2F09%2F15%2F4e%2FMeettheMoji.28eb4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2f0geji5PMS0TPiKiBnreX3dJSQ=/356x205/2015%2F09%2F15%2F4e%2FMeettheMoji.28eb4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ArgPNjqHidOmvyyLxGcecU89urA=/712x410/2015%2F09%2F15%2F4e%2FMeettheMoji.28eb4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7aFdqBBwA5vbYvKCIB8tH9qL4Mo=/280x157/2015%2F09%2F15%2F4e%2FMeettheMoji.28eb4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ey0E9Zw8nBS7yvI2aOUCLYOhCWo=/560x314/2015%2F09%2F15%2F4e%2FMeettheMoji.28eb4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1NutL56","display_title":"Skype Mojis let you share TV and movie clips directly in your chats","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"babies-skyping"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Skype Mojis allow users to share short clips from movies and TV shows.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"55f3447eb589e4750c0000a9","id":"2015/09/11/babies-skyping","title":"Do babies know the difference between Skyping and watching 'Sesame Street'?","title_tag":null,"author":"The Atlantic","post_date":"2015-09-11T21:15:35+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 21:15:35 +0000","formatted_date":"09/11/2015","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1zAwdA","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/09/11/babies-skyping/","content":{"plain":"Long before most babies toddle or talk, they begin to make sophisticated inferences about the world around them. By as young as 3 months old, newborns can form expectations based on physical principles like gravity, speed, and momentum.\n\nScientists at several universities told me they now have evidence, to the likely delight of far-flung grandparents everywhere, that infants can also tell the difference between, say, a broadcast of Mister Rogers and a video call with their actual grandfather. The ability to discern between video broadcast and video-based chat from infancy, which researchers have only recently confirmed, could have a profound effect on our understanding of how the human brain develops — and specifically, how technologies can play a role in shaping abstract concepts early on.\n\n\"Babies who are pretty young are able to pick up, in particular, whether or not an adult is actually responding to them in real time,\" said Elisabeth McClure, a researcher who focuses on children and media at Georgetown University. \"Some television shows try to imitate this. You see, for example, with Elmo, or on Blue's Clue's, they look directly at the camera and pretend to interact with the child. There's evidence that babies can tell the difference as early as 6 months old.\"\n\nThis is meaningful for a few reasons, not least of which is cultural. Extended families are increasingly spread across greater geographic distances. Video calls are how many babies first meet their grandparents, their aunts and uncles, and other people who love them. Video-chat technologies, then, have major implications for how humans perceive key relationships.\n\nWhile interfaces like Skype, FaceTime, and Google Hangout are still relatively new, this area of research builds on decades of experiments involving children and electronic screens. Researchers have long studied how passive television viewing affects young children, and how well children can learn from watching educational programming, but scientists are only just beginning to figure out how babies understand screen interactions with another person in real time.\n\nMichael Rich, the director of the Center on Media and Child Health and a pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School, said that the latest findings help illustrate how the concept of \"screen time\" is too broad. \"Given the plethora of screens and uses for those screens that we have now, I think that we have to be a little sanguine about how much we can extrapolate,\" he said.\n\nOf course, babies being babies, it's hard to know what they're thinking just by watching how they act. \"Just because they stare at a screen doesn't mean they are interpreting it, decoding it, understanding it,\" Rich said. \"Can a baby decode the pattern of light and dark on a two-dimensional object as a symbol of Grandma's face, and perceive that the noise they hear is generated by Grandma talking to them?\"\n\nBack at Georgetown, McClure and her team conducted a survey across Washington, D.C., asking parents of infants and toddlers how many of them had ever participated in a video chat like FaceTime. \"85% of the families that we surveyed who have babies under 2 said they had ever used it,\" McClure said. \"And almost 40% said they used it once a week. Not only are they using [this technology], but they use it a lot.\"\n\nAnd not only that — these chats were surprisingly long, often lasting for 20 minutes or more. And many parents of young children reported using video chat with their kids even though the kids weren't allowed to watch television. \"Even families who avoid video exposure,\" McClure said, \"they make an exception for video chat.\"\n\nAs a doctoral student, McClure spent much of her time observing families with their babies during these video calls. In particular, she wanted to assess how they coped with the limitations of streaming video chat, which can be glitchy and inconsistent. Even when the conversations are technologically flawless, the format itself disrupts many of the cues that help babies understand what's going on in a face-to-face interaction. \"Babies are very sensitive to eye contact, physical contact, pointing at things, and all of those can be compromised,\" McClure said.\n\nFor example, babies watching television or movies tend to be confused when broadcast sound is even slightly out of sync. \"A 4-month-old can barely hold their head up but if there's a tape delay, they're not as responsive and they get upset by it,\" said Georgene Troseth, an associate professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University. \"Really tiny babies pick up on the social responsiveness of a person. If there's something wacky about it, it bothers them.\"\n\nStudy after study has demonstrated that when the natural timing in an interaction lags, it can \"really hurt a baby's ability to learn,\" said Rachel Barr, a developmental psychologist at Georgetown. \"So it's an interesting question: How do we form a knowledge of people if we're only seeing them in two dimensions? How do we know if they're interacting with us?\"\n\nBabies end up learning best, perhaps not surprisingly, with guidance from a trusted caregiver. So despite the ream of technological limitations that can accompany Internet-based video chats, even infants can cope well when a call doesn't go as planned. \"Just saying something like, 'The internet's not working,'\" Barr said. \"That's what you would do if you were orienting a child to any other sort of new play situation, helping them navigate. Trying to figure out what's in the world and who's in the world — this can be done in creative ways across a screen. And kids are responding in ways as if the screen was not there.\"\n\nA growing body of research shows that babies appear to thrive on real-time video interactions. Researchers have found that toddlers are more comforted by their mothers via video chat than they are through audio alone. And video chat appears to be, conceptually, much easier for babies to grasp than a phone conversation.\n\n\"It turns out that babies are really bad with phones,\" Barr said. \"Because they can't really talk and so there's no back-and-forth ... The baby may be nodding and communicating, but there's no way for the person on the other end to see that they're responding. And there's no way for the baby to know the person can't see them.\"\n\nThese sorts of challenges in logic and reasoning exist not just for babies but for older kids, too, all the way up to around the time a child is in second grade. \"Previous observational research has shown that children under 7 have trouble using phones — and babies and toddlers in particular have trouble with it,\" McClure said. \"They're pre-verbal. There are a lot of cognitive skills that go into understanding what a disembodied voice represents.\"\n\nMore broadly, watching how babies handle interactions that are separated by a screen is one way to get at the question of how they process and understand their surroundings in general. \"What they understand as being reality, whether they know a grandparent is a grandparent,\" McClure said. \"There are a few things that came up as we were observing that have really made me start asking: How are babies perceiving reality?\" That's a question that Troseth, the psychologist at Vanderbilt, has been focused on since long before video chats existed. More than a decade ago, she and her research team would rig up a camcorder and a screen so they could assess how babies might react to seeing themselves on a monitor in real-time — an experience that's now common with smartphones that have forward-facing cameras. But the ability to look at a screen and discern what's real, or what's happening in real-time, has implications that extend beyond any specific technological application. \"How does a picture represent reality? This is the very beginning of symbolic reality, a kid's exposure to motion picture, so that's very important,\" she said.\n\nTroseth and her colleagues have data that shows children, by 2 years old, are able to figure out that what they see on television is not real because it's not directly connected to their environment. Of course, that depends on how much exposure to television a child has had. Which brings us back to the growing population of babies who get limited exposure to TV, but frequently participate in video chats.\n\n\"If you had a kid who had never seen television and they'd never used a computer — and the first time they used a screen there's a person using their name and talking to them — what would their experience be like compared with someone whose experience with screens first involved roadrunners and talking dogs?\" Troseth said. \"I think the social support of the person who's with the child could be really, really important.\"\n\nThat's exactly what other researchers have found. In addition to helping babies understand what's going on when a video chat is frozen or otherwise malfunctioning, McClure says she observed lots of interactive play between babies on one side of a video chat and the adults on the other — with help from the caregivers sitting next to the babies. Many of them would play little games that helped establish the video chat as an interaction, rather than a one-way broadcast. Imagine, for instance, a grandfather blowing in the direction of the screen, and the parent sitting next to the child on the other side of that screen blowing onto her face so she can feel the effect. \"Babies also like to share things through the screen, particularly food,\" McClure told me. \"They like to try to feed their grandparents. Then [the grandparents] pretend to receive the food on the side and eat it.\"\n\nThese interactions may seem silly, but their implications are profound. McClure recalls one toddler who was trying to feed raisins to her grandfather through the screen of the iPad on which he appeared. The little girl would walk around the iPad with a handful of raisins and look for him. She'd also leave raisins for him there, behind the screen. Her mother tried to help her understand that although the man appeared on the screen, he actually lived in another house some distance away. \"The mother kept saying, 'Where does Grandpa live?' And the little girl pointed to the screen and said, 'Right there!' And in a sense, that is where he lives. When you want to see Grandpa, you go to the screen and ask for him.\"\n\nChildren are able, eventually, to grasp the fact that a conversation with a person who appears onscreen does not mean that person is inside the device on which he appears. But how important is that distinction in the early stages of a baby's life, anyway? Much of what babies first learn about human interaction, with or without technology, involves metaphor and simulation. For the babies who spend time video-chatting, it emerges not just in pretending to feed somebody raisins through an iPad, but through gestures of affection.\n\n\"We saw a lot of screen kisses that, to me, really raise a question about what's real,\" McClure told me. \"In one sense, it's impossible for them to touch. But, on the other hand, affection really is being transferred. It's kind of like blowing a kiss. Everyone knows that a kiss can't fly through the air, but it's a socially accepted form of affection. It's something we teach babies to do really early on.\"\n\nResearchers believe that something similar may be happening in the way babies learn about human relationships through screen-based communication. Video chatting may be redefining the fundamental basis on which babies form an understanding of social interactions. \"Parents are not encouraging a child to pretend to give affection,\" McClure said. \"They're encouraging them to give real affection through the screen. They don't say, 'Kiss the screen.' They say, 'Kiss Grandma.' They are teaching them that it is real.\""},"shares":{"twitter":648,"facebook":380,"linked_in":20,"google_plus":82,"total":1130},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/T2ql0VkE61wOnzlH6gEfDL4xoKk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F09%2F11%2F68%2Fbaby.88b0f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5x4RTvpAj2BwNFKYgfvqlch4Jag=/1438x0/2015%2F09%2F11%2F68%2Fbaby.88b0f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gnNFll-H_yQuqJt5AkD297XG4nI=/356x205/2015%2F09%2F11%2F68%2Fbaby.88b0f.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_4ttJYcRlaxJInxJ2CgTLhJxMAo=/712x410/2015%2F09%2F11%2F68%2Fbaby.88b0f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/szXW5zGtyX0X_LS0-xwMsRyZqEM=/280x157/2015%2F09%2F11%2F68%2Fbaby.88b0f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AhRutnHcWVz3jFHdddfTuZzPO9M=/560x314/2015%2F09%2F11%2F68%2Fbaby.88b0f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1FClNR4","display_title":"Do babies know the difference between Skyping and watching 'Sesame Street'?","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Grandparents, take heart!

It will be available to people with existing Skype WiFi accounts, which currently includes 2 million hotspots, or those who have paid into the company's \"Work + Play\" or Surface 2 + Skype WiFi\" bundles.\n\nThere will also be a business version of the service for Office 365 Enterprise subscribers, according to the website. \"Microsoft WiFi had coverage at over 10 million hotspots across 130 million countries, including airports, hotels, restaurants and other public spaces,\" the company writes in a description on a cached page for Microsoft WiFi for Business.\n\nOther details about the hotspot service, including cost and when it will officially launch, are unclear, though a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed it's in the works.\n\n\"We can confirm that Microsoft is working on a new service, called Microsoft WiFi, that will bring hassle-free Wi-Fi to millions,\" the spokesperson said. \"We look forward to sharing additional detail when available, but don’t have anything at this moment.\""},"shares":{"facebook":535,"twitter":1110,"google_plus":26,"total":1671},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aAe7AdAhRYYPe8nTKhMov4RFyik=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F06%2F02%2F18%2Fmicrosoftwi.5829f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZO07UMBhDPYq05gr-zpuldskyk4=/1438x0/2015%2F06%2F02%2F18%2Fmicrosoftwi.5829f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kqijKeDRpVJHDMRzhuXSPJW6Hz4=/356x205/2015%2F06%2F02%2F18%2Fmicrosoftwi.5829f.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZIMRophHhxUiXETq990M9pJt52o=/712x410/2015%2F06%2F02%2F18%2Fmicrosoftwi.5829f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Yf-zfXnDrFuQxoC09Kh6dBpJxfM=/280x157/2015%2F06%2F02%2F18%2Fmicrosoftwi.5829f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u_Djks-o7jSA0f6Eq8O3UQKQNbU=/560x314/2015%2F06%2F02%2F18%2Fmicrosoftwi.5829f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1AM6acr","display_title":"Microsoft accidentally leaks plans for a new Wi-Fi hotspot service","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/06/02/windows-10-faq/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"On-the-go Wi-Fi access may soon be a lot easier for Microsoft customers.\r\n","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"55521da197b2f8570e000002","id":"2015/05/12/microsoft-skype-translator-preview-open-to-all","title":"Microsoft opens Skype Translator Preview to all, but still calls it a preview","title_tag":null,"author":"Lance Ulanoff","post_date":"2015-05-12T15:34:47+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 12 May 2015 15:34:47 +0000","formatted_date":"05/12/2015","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1yScZW","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/05/12/microsoft-skype-translator-preview-open-to-all/","content":{"plain":"When is a preview no longer a preview? \n\nWhen everybody has access, but don't tell Microsoft that.

At the time, I was impressed with Skype Translator Preview's ability to deliver translated English audio to her and spoken Spanish translation to me instantly. It was clear that the system was not only interpreting each word, it was understanding the context. \n\nIn December, Peter Lee, corporate vice president of Microsoft Research, told me the system does try to make sense of the words, “It’s not good enough to just get all the words you're saying, [you] have to understand a little bit about the words,” he said.\n\nSince that first trial run, Microsoft has added Italian and Chinese (Mandarin) voice translation services. It can also do text-only translation for 50 languages.\n\nAlong with the wider release of Skype Translator Preview, Microsoft posted a video highlighting the app's impact on the New York City-based nonprofit Pro Mujer and its work with women in Latin America. \n\nNo word yet on when \"preview\" will be dropped or if it will ever support Windows 7."},"shares":{"twitter":783,"facebook":262,"google_plus":21,"total":1066},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/J38qIrRgjSZXXbTzcPuyel8kEVE=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F05%2F12%2Fc6%2FSkypeTransl.67b1c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bNFQ7nYHxKOXpQj90MXFlQ7W1J0=/1438x0/2015%2F05%2F12%2Fc6%2FSkypeTransl.67b1c.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IXt3ej9CfsR6bhh2bXop-4iV-5c=/356x205/2015%2F05%2F12%2Fc6%2FSkypeTransl.67b1c.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zxmOhw0HZ2o6y-bTiNcZGqtxnFk=/712x410/2015%2F05%2F12%2Fc6%2FSkypeTransl.67b1c.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/e9NKFgiW1LlL7-E20hKDmfG7C1c=/280x157/2015%2F05%2F12%2Fc6%2FSkypeTransl.67b1c.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DCdYb8PYlLH0eLOykmrtNgMOstU=/560x314/2015%2F05%2F12%2Fc6%2FSkypeTransl.67b1c.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1cNYpsc","display_title":"Microsoft opens Skype Translator Preview to all, but still calls it a preview","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2014/07/09/skype-for-beginners/"}],"brightcove":[{"id":3939428196001,"data-video":3939428196001}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Microsoft is making Skype Translator Preview available to everyone running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Preview, but keeping the \"Preview\" name intact.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"5525277112d2cd23cb00001a","id":"2015/04/08/skype-translator-preview-update-brings-mandarin-fluency","title":"Skype Translator Preview adds Mandarin, the language of 1 billion people","title_tag":null,"author":"Lance Ulanoff","post_date":"2015-04-08T11:07:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 08 Apr 2015 11:07:02 +0000","formatted_date":"04/08/2015","formatted_shares":"1.6k","sort_key":"1yFPFm","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/04/08/skype-translator-preview-update-brings-mandarin-fluency/","content":{"plain":"Skype Translator Preview, the multi-lingual video conferencing tool from Microsoft, has added what is arguably the world's most popular language: Mandarin Chinese.\n\nStarting today, Skype Translator Preview, which is still in invite-only beta and only works on Windows 8.1 and above, can do real-time voice translations of Mandarin and Italian. As with the preview's previous language skills, Skype Translator can, in real time, translate spoken words from English to Mandarin and Mandarin to English, creating a near fluent conversation between two people who might otherwise not be able to communicate.\n\n See also: The real-world test on Microsoft Skype Translator Preview\n\nThe translation is not yet perfect, according to Microsoft Research's Olivier Fontana, but both Italian and Mandarin Chinese have reached a level of competency where the Skype Translator team is comfortable releasing the update to the tens of thousands of people currently in the invite-only program.\n\nThe addition of Chinese, which is spoken by over 1 billion people world-wide, brings the total number of real-time voice translation languages to four: Spanish, English, Chinese (Mandarin) and Italian. Microsoft recently added Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian to the app’s text translations services, which brings that number of supported languages to 50.\n\nOlivier, who admitted that his native French is not yet supported, noted that the team's work on Mandarin Chinese was greatly assisted by having a Microsoft Research team based in China. \"It helped us work out the specificities of Chinese,\" he told Mashable.\n\nThe new languages will arrive automatically in Skype Translator Preview, but Microsoft Research also has a handful of interface updates that Windows 8.1 users (where Translator is supported), will have to download an app update to access.\n\nThe new app will now show partial sentence translations as the system figures them out. Fontana said this may aid in more fluid conversations. \n\nThey've also done some work to try and clear up confusion that can occur when two people are speaking in different languages and the system is speaking over them in translated voices. The update will, when it's ready to speak the translation, subtlety lower the audio on the native speaker's voice. So on the English side, you’ll better hear an English-speaking translation and on the Chinese side, they'll better hear a Chinese translation.\n\nThe update will also make it easier to hide the on screen text-to-speech, to cut down on the confusion of seeing other languages, which they cannot read anyway, transcribed on screen. \n\nMicrosoft's Fontana said that Skype Translator will work natively with Windows 10 machines. No word yet on when the company will officially release Skype Translator. For now, Fontana is most interested in gathering more and more data to improve the system. “Data is our gas, that’s how we go forward,” he said."},"shares":{"twitter":1213,"facebook":352,"google_plus":37,"total":1602},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E6dqOoeg5urBIxg0JZjDQ8kgPxI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F04%2F08%2F97%2FTranslator.f43db.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H9MngjIoEi26vCaas_Lmeb77lxc=/1438x0/2015%2F04%2F08%2F97%2FTranslator.f43db.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Af-Jx7jAdd8MQccUHU0HTVNEApc=/356x205/2015%2F04%2F08%2F97%2FTranslator.f43db.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/L7E8ESLXabszZuVaF0SV--X5GrQ=/712x410/2015%2F04%2F08%2F97%2FTranslator.f43db.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E1qj58i_8wQ7KPDRDCzVExvEDH0=/280x157/2015%2F04%2F08%2F97%2FTranslator.f43db.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vbCr7a6oIyufbAguwRNa1mny9Vc=/560x314/2015%2F04%2F08%2F97%2FTranslator.f43db.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1O73usy","display_title":"Skype Translator Preview adds Mandarin, the language of 1 billion people","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"microsoft-skype-translator-preview"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Microsoft's still-in-preview communication tool can speak more languages than you -- not that it's bragging.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"}],"page":1,"per_page":34,"total":284}
