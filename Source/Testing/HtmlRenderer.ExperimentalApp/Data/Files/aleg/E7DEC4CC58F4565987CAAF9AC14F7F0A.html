        <font size="3">Guarding the entrance to Baltimore
        harbor via the Patapsco River during the War of 1812, Fort McHenry
        faced almost certain attack by British forces. Major George Armistead,
        the stronghold's commander, was ready to defend the fort, but he wanted
        a flag that would identify his position, and one whose size would be
        visible to the enemy from a distance. Determined to supply such a flag,
        a committee of high-ranking officers called on Mary Young Pickersgill,
        a Baltimore widow who had had experience making ship flags, and
        explained that they wanted a United States flag that measured 30 feet
        by 42 feet. She agreed to the job.</font> 
        <p>
            <font size="3">With the help of her 13-year-old
            daughter, Caroline, Mrs. Pickersgill spent several weeks measuring,
            cutting, and sewing the 15 stars and stripes. When the time came to
            sew the elements of the flag together, they realized that their
            house was not large enough. Mrs. Pickersgill thus asked the owner
            of nearby Claggett's brewery for permission to assemble the flag on
            the building's floor during evening hours. He agreed, and the women
            worked by candlelight to finish it. Once completed, the flag was
            delivered to the committee, and Mrs. Pickersgill was paid $405.90.
            In August 1813, it was presented to Major Armistead, but, as things
            turned out, more than a year would pass before hostile forces
            threatened Baltimore.</font>

            Baltimore. On the morning of September 13, 1814, British bomb ships
            began hurling high-trajectory shells toward Fort McHenry from
            positions beyond the reach of the fort's guns. The bombardment
            continued throughout the rainy night.</font>

            <font size="3">Anxiously awaiting news of the
            battle's outcome was a Washington, D.C., lawyer named Francis Scott
            Key. Key had visited the enemy's fleet to secure the release of a
            Maryland doctor, who had been abducted by the British after they
            left Washington. The lawyer had been successful in his mission, but
            he could not escort the doctor home until the attack ended. So he
            waited on a flag-of-truce sloop anchored eight miles downstream
            from Fort McHenry.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="3">During the night, there had been
            only occasional sounds of the fort's guns returning fire. At dawn,
            the British bombardment tapered off. Had the fort been captured?
            Placing a telescope to his eye, Key trained it on the fort's
            flagpole. There he saw the large garrison flag catch the morning
            breeze. It had been raised as a gesture of defiance, replacing the
            wet storm flag that had flown through the night.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="3">Thrilled by the sight of the flag
            and the knowledge that the fort had not fallen, Key took a letter
            from his pocket, and began to write some verses on the back of it.
            Later, after the British fleet had withdrawn, Key checked into a
            Baltimore hotel, and completed his poem on the defense of Fort
            McHenry. He then sent it to a printer for duplication on handbills,
            and within a few days the poem was put to the music of an old
            English song. Both the new song and the flag became known as &quot;The
            Star-Spangled Banner.&quot;</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="3">For his leadership in defending the
            fort, Armistead was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel and
            acquired the garrison flag sometime before his death in 1818. A few
            weeks after the battle, he had granted the wishes of a soldier's
            widow for a piece of the flag to bury with her husband. In
            succeeding years, he cut off additional pieces to gratify the
            similar wishes of others; the flag itself was seen only on rare
            occasions.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="3">When Commodore George H. Preble,
            U.S. Navy, was preparing a history of the American flag, he
            borrowed the Star-Spangled Banner from a descendant of Colonel
            Armistead, and, in 1873, photographed it for the first time. In
            preparation for that event, a canvas backing was attached to it;
            soon thereafter, it was put in storage until the Smithsonian
            borrowed it and placed it on exhibit in 1907.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="3">The flag had become a popular
            attraction; in 1912, the owner, Eben Appleton, of New York,
            believing that the flag should be kept in the National Museum,
            donated it to the Smithsonian on the condition that it would remain
            there forever. Once in its possession, the Smithsonian hired an
            expert flag restorer to remove the old backing and sew on a new one
            to prevent damage during display.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <font size="3">The Star-Spangled Banner remained
            in the Arts and Industries Building (the old National Museum) as
            the new National Museum was constructed across the Mall. In 1964,
            when the Museum of American History opened, the flag was moved to a
            prominent place inside the museum's Mall entrance, an awe-inspiring
            testament to our nation's independence.</font>
