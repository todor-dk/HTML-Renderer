<P>
A common point of disagreement between Muslims and Christians 
is the Christian belief that God does take on a human form and 
actually became man in the person of Jesus Christ without ceasing 
to be God. Yet, Christians do not believe that God in his essential 
nature is man, but only became man at the Incarnation. 
<P>
<P>According to the Holy Bible God created all things from nothing:
<P>
<blockquote>
"In the beginning <B>God created the heavens and the earth</B>." Genesis 1:1
<P>
"By the word of the LORD <B>the heavens were made</B>, And by the breath 
of His mouth <B>all their host</B>." Psalm 33:6 
<P>
"All things came into being through Him, <B>and apart from Him nothing 
came into being that has come into being</B>." John 1:3 
<P>
"and saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men of 
the same nature as you, and preach the gospel to you that you should 
turn from these vain things to a living God, <B>WHO MADE THE HEAVEN 
AND THE EARTH AND THE SEA AND ALL THAT IS IN THEM</B>." Acts 14:15
<P>
"<B>The God who made the world and all things in it</B>, since He is 
Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;" 
Acts 17:24
<P>
"(as it is written, A FATHER OF MANY NATIONS HAVE I MADE YOU) in the 
presence of Him whom he believed, even God, who gives life to the dead 
<B>and calls into being that which does not exist</B>." Romans 4:17
<P>
"For by Him <B>all things were created</B>, <B>both in the heavens 
and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions 
or rulers or authorities - all things have been created through Him 
and for Him</B>. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold 
together." Colossians 1:16-17
</blockquote>

<P>Scripture hints to the fact that God created time also:
<P>
<blockquote>
"in these last days has spoken to us in His Son, whom He appointed 
heir of all things, through whom also <B>He made the <I>world</I></B> 
(Greek- <I>aionas</I>, lit. <I>the ages</I>)." Hebrews 1:2
</blockquote>

<P>According to the <I>Lexical Aids to the New Testament</I>, compiled 
and edited by Spiros Zodhiates, Th.D., The Greek word <I>aionas</I> is 
derived from:
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>165. Aion; age, refers to an age or time</B> in contr. to <I>kosmos</I> (2889), 
referring to people or space. Derived from <I>aei</I> (104), always, and 
<I>on</I>, being. <B>Denotes duration or continuance of time</B>, but 
with great variety. (1) Both in the sing. or pl. it signifies eternity 
whether past or to come (Mt. 6:13; Mk. 3:29; Lk. 1:55; Jn. 4:14; 6:51; 
Acts 15:18; Eph. 3:11, etc.); <B>for ages, of ages</B> (Rev. 1:6,18; 
5:14; 10:6; 14:11; 15:7; 20:10). (2) The duration of this world 
(Mt. 28:20; Jn. 9:32; Acts 3:21); since the beginning of the world 
(Mt. 13:39, etc.). (3) Pl. <I>hoi aiones</I>, the ages of the world 
(1 Cor. 2:7; Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:26). (4) <I>Ho aion houtos</I>, this 
age, generation (Lk. 16:8; 20:34, cf. Mt. 13:22; 1 Cor. 1:20; 2:6; 
Gal. 1:4; Eph. 2:2; 1 Tim. 6:17; 11 Tim. 4:10; Tit. 2:12). 
(5) <I>Ho aion ho erchomenos</I>, the age, the coming one, meaning 
the next life (Mk. 10:30; Lk. 18:30, cf. Lk. 20:35) (6) An age or 
dispensation of providence (Mt. 24:3, cf. Mt. 12:32; 1 Cor. 10:11; 
Heb. 1:2; 6:5; 9:26). (7) <I>Aiones</I>, ages, in Heb. 11:3 refers 
to the great occurrences which took place in the universe. 
<B><I>Aion</I> primarily has physical meaning (time)</B> but also 
ethical. Signifies time, short or long in its unbroken duration, 
all of which exists in the world under conditions of time, ethically, 
the cause and current of this world's affairs. It has acquired, like 
<I>kosmos</I> (2889), an unfavorable meaning (Lk. 16:8; 20:34; Eph. 2:2; 
Gal. 1:4). (<I>New American Standard Bible Hebrew-Greek Key Word Study Bible</I>

<P>
Hence, a plausible interpretation of Hebrews 1:3 is that God created both 
the universe along with time through the agency of his Son, the Lord Jesus 
Christ. This point is solidified by the following NT citations:
<P>
<blockquote>
"who has saved us and called us to a holy life - not because of anything we 
have done but because of his own purpose and grace. <B>This grace was given 
us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time</B>, but it has now been 
revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed 
death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel." 
2 Timothy 1:9-10
<P>
"Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of 
God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness - a faith 
and knowledge resting on the hope of <B>eternal life, which God, who does not 
lie, promised before the beginning of time</B>, and at his appointed season 
he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the 
command of God our Savior," Titus 1:1-3
</blockquote>
<P>
The fact that God and Christ both precede time itself strongly argues that 
time was created by God.
<P>
Therefore, seeing that God created time implies that he is timeless. 
Seeing that God created matter makes him an immaterial Being. Seeing 
that God also created the dimensions of space implies that he is 
spaceless. Being spaceless implies that God must be absolutely one, 
since for there to be more than one God would necessitate spatial 
dimensions. Therefore God is one eternal, omnipresent Spirit having 
no type of body whatsoever. This would also make him invisible, 
having no visible form. This is precisely the description that the 
Holy Bible gives of God:
<P>
<blockquote>
"Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, <B>the LORD is one!</B>" Deuteronomy 6:4
<P>
"<B>Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?</B> 
If I ascend to heaven, <B>You are there;</B> If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, 
<B>You are there</B>. If I take the wings of the dawn, If I dwell in the remotest 
part of the sea, <B>Even there Your hand will lead me, And Your right hand will 
lay hold of me</B>. If I say, Surely the darkness will overwhelm me, And the 
light around me will be night, Even the darkness is not dark to You, And the 
night is as bright as the day. <B>Darkness and light are alike to You</B>." 
Psalm 139:7-12
<P>
"'Am I a God who is near, declares the LORD, 'And not a God far off? 
<B>Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him? declares 
the LORD. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?'</B> declares the LORD." 
Jeremiah 23:23-24 
<P>
"He is the image of <B>the invisible God</B>, the firstborn of all 
creation." Colossians 1:15
<P>
"Now to the King <B>eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God</B>, 
be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen." 1 Timothy 1:17
<P>
"which He will bring about at the proper time - He who is the blessed 
and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone 
possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, <B>whom no 
man has seen or can see</B>. To Him be honor and eternal dominion! 
Amen."  1 Timothy 6:15-16
</blockquote>
<P>
Yet, the Holy Bible also states that God would often assume visible 
form allowing his servants the ability to see him visibly: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Micaiah said, 'Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. <B>I saw 
the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing 
by Him on His right and on His left</B>. The LORD said, "Who will 
entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?" And one said this 
while another said that. Then a spirit came forward and stood before 
the LORD and said, "I will entice him." The LORD said to him, "How?" 
And he said, "I will go out and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth 
of all his prophets." Then He said, "You are to entice him and also 
prevail. Go and do so." Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put 
a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and the 
LORD has proclaimed disaster against you.'" 1 Kings 22:19-23
<P>
"In the year of King Uzziah's death <B>I saw the Lord sitting on 
a throne, lofty and exalted, with the train of His robe filling 
the temple</B>. Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings: 
with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, 
and with two he flew. And one called out to another and said, 
'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of hosts, The whole earth is full 
of His glory.' And the foundations of the thresholds trembled at 
the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling 
with smoke. Then I said, 'Woe is me, for I am ruined! Because 
I am a man of unclean lips, And I live among a people of unclean 
lips; <B>For my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts</B>.'" 
Isaiah 6:1-5
<P>
"I kept looking Until thrones were set up, <B>And the Ancient of 
Days took His seat; His vesture was like white snow And the hair 
of His head like pure wool.</B> <B>His throne was ablaze with 
flames</B>, Its wheels were a burning fire. A river of fire was 
flowing And coming out from before Him; Thousands upon thousands 
were attending Him, And myriads upon myriads were standing before 
Him; The court sat, And the books were opened." Daniel 7:9-10
</blockquote>
<P>
Furthermore, according to the NT God actually became man in the 
person of Jesus Christ without ceasing to be God:
<P>
<blockquote>
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, <B>and 
the Word was God</B>... <B>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt 
among us</B>, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten 
from the Father, full of grace and truth." John 1:1, 14 
</blockquote>
<P>
Hence, God in his essential nature is immaterial, invisible and 
spaceless. Yet, God assumed visible form and actually took on 
a physical body at the Incarnation of Jesus Christ without this 
effecting his invisible, immaterial divine nature:
<P>
<blockquote>
"For in Him <B>all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form</B>," 
Colossians 2:9
</blockquote>

<P>
This is precisely the point that Muslims refuse to accept. Muslims think 
it inconceivable that their god, Allah could or would assume a visible 
form or actually become man.
<P>
<A NAME="anthropomorphic"></A>
Yet, interestingly both the Quran and hadiths affirm that Allah actually 
has a visible form and that Allah actually moves from place to place. 
Here is a sampling of Quranic passages affirming that Allah has a visible 
body:
<P>
<B>The Quran Attributes Movement To Allah</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
Nay! When the earth is pounded by power, <B>AND THY LORD COMETH, and 
His angels</B>, rank upon rank, and Hell, that Day, is brought face 
to face - On that Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance 
profit him? S. 89:21-23 
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>The Quran Gives A Visible Form To Allah</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
By the Star when it goes down,- Your Companion is neither astray 
nor being misled. Nor does he say (aught) of (his own) Desire. 
It is no less than inspiration sent down to him: <B>He was taught 
by one Mighty in Power, Endued with Wisdom: FOR HE APPEARED 
(in stately form);</B> While he was in the highest part of the 
horizon: <B>THEN HE APPROACHED HIM AND CAME CLOSER</B>, And was 
at a distance of but two bow-lengths or (even) nearer; 
<B>SO DID HE (God) CONVEY THE INSPIRATION TO HIS SERVANT</B>- 
(conveyed) what He (meant) to convey. S. 53:1-10 (Yusuf Ali's translation)
</blockquote>
<P>
This passage clearly states that Muhammad saw Allah approaching him 
in visible form. Muslims have claimed that the person whom Muhammad 
saw was the Angel Gabriel. This interpretation will not work since 
the passage claims that the person that appeared to Muhammad was 
Muhammad's sovereign as indicated by the last part of the sentence, 
"TO HIS SERVANT." Unless Muslims want to claim that Muhammad is the 
servant of Gabriel, there is no avoiding the inescapable conclusion 
that the person whom Muhammad saw in visible form was none other 
than Allah himself.
<P>
<blockquote>
Verily this is the word of a most honourable Messenger, 
Endued with Power, with rank before <B>THE LORD OF THE THRONE</B>, 
With authority there, (and) faithful to his trust. 
And (O people!) your companion is not one possessed; 
<B>And without doubt HE SAW HIM IN THE CLEAR HORIZON</B>. 
Neither doth he withhold grudgingly a knowledge of the Unseen. 
Nor is it the word of an evil spirit accursed. S. 81:19-25
</blockquote>
<P>
Again, the person whom Muhammad saw is none other than the Lord 
of the Throne, i.e. Allah. There is no other referent in the 
context of the passage and therefore the burden of proof is upon 
the Muslims to show that Muhammad did not see Allah visibly, 
but rather the Angel Gabriel. Noted Islamicist, F.E. Peters 
comments on the preceding Suras, specifically 53:1-12:
<P>
<blockquote>
"None of the pronouns is identified in these verses, though there is little 
doubt that the recipient of the vision was Muhammad. Who was seen is less 
clear, and if Muhammad's being referred to as his 'servant' in verse 10 
suggests that is God Himself, the Muslim tradition preferred to understand 
that it was Gabriel in all the other instances, chiefly because later in his 
own career Muhammad, as we shall see, had unmistakably come to the same 
conclusion. But there is no other mention of Gabriel in the Meccan suras, 
and it appears far more likely that God Himself first appeared to Muhammad 
'on the high horizon' and then on a second occasion by the lotus tree near 
the 'garden of the dwelling' to show him 'the signs of his Lord.' Muhammad 
was clearly earthbound when he had his first experience, but where the 
latter vision took place, whether in a known locality in Mecca or, as is 
often thought, in some heavenly venue, is not further indicated. Neither is 
there anything to suggest that it was on either of these occasions that 
Muhammad received the words of the Quran.
<P>
"If Sura 53:1-18 seems to say that Muhammad believed that on two distinct 
occasions he had a vision of God, who thereby prompted him and showed to him 
His signs, the second vision is referred to only in briefing in passing. 
(Quran 81:19-27)
<P>
"Although verse 10 appears to refer back to the same vision 'on the high 
horizon' mentioned in 53:7-9, the Muslim commentators saw in the first three 
verses of this passage from Sura 81 an unmistakable reference to Gabriel. 
But there is abundant evidence that Muhammad not only did not identify 
Gabriel as the agent of revelation until his Medina days, but that while at 
Mecca he was criticized for the fact that God had not sent an angelic 
messenger: 'They said: "If your Lord had so pleased, He would certainly have 
sent down angels; as it is, we disbelieve your mission".' (Quran 41:14)
<P>
"Muhammad's earliest response did not encourage them to think that there 
was in fact an angel in God's revelation to him:
<P>
They say: 'You to whom the Reminder is being sent down, truly you are 
jinn-possessed! Why do you not bring angels to us if you are one of 
those who posses truth?' We do not send down the angels except when 
required, and if they came, there would be not repsite. (Ibid., 15:6-8)
<P>
And before you as well the Messengers we sent down were but men, to whom 
We granted inspiration. And if you do not understand that, ask the people 
who possess the Reminder. (Ibid., 16:43)

[State of University Press New York, Albany 1994], pp. 142-143)

<P>
The next set of hadiths clearly say that Allah appeared visibly and literally touched Muhammad:
<P>
<blockquote>
Narrated AbdurRahman ibn A'ish<br>
Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: <b>I saw my Lord, the Exalted 
and Glorious in the most beautiful form</b>. He said: What do the Angels in 
the presence of Allah contend about? I said: Thou art the most aware of it. 
<b>He then placed HIS PALM between my shoulders and I felt its coldness 
in my chest</b> and I came to know what was in the Heavens and the Earth. 
He recited: 'Thus did we show Ibrahim the kingdom of the Heavens and 
the Earth and it was so that he might have certainty.' (6:75)<br>
Darimi reported it in a mursal form and Tirmidhi also reported. (Tirmidhi 
Hadith, Number 237- ALIM CD-ROM Version)
<P>
Narrated Mu'adh ibn Jabal<br>
Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was detained one morning from 
observing the dawn prayer (in congregation) along with us till the sun had 
almost appeared on the horizon. He then came out hurriedly and Iqamah for 
prayer was observed and he conducted it (prayer) in brief form. When he had 
concluded the prayer by saying As-salamu alaykum wa Rahmatullah, he called 
out to us saying: Remain in your places as you were. Then turning to us he 
said: I am going to tell you what detained me from you (on account of which 
I could not join you in the prayer) in the morning. I got up in the night 
and performed ablution and observed the prayer as had been ordained for me. 
I dozed in my prayer till I was overcome by (sleep) and lo, <b>I found 
myself in the presence of my Lord, the Blessed and the Glorious, in the best 
form</b>. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: 
What these highest angels contend about? I said: I do not know. He repeated it 
thrice. <b>He said: Then I saw Him put HIS PALMS between my shoulder 
blades till I felt the coldness of His fingers between the two sides of my 
chest</b>. Then everything was illuminated for me and I could recognize 
everything. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: 
What do these high angels contend about? I said: In regard to expiations. He 
said: What are these? I said: Going on foot to join congregational prayers, 
sitting in the mosques after the prayers, performing ablution well despite 
difficulties. He again said: Then what do they contend? I said: In regard to 
the ranks. He said: What are these? I said: Providing of food, speaking 
gently, observing the prayer when the people are asleep. He again said to 
me: Beg (Your Lord) and say: O Allah, I beg of Thee (power) to do good 
deeds, and abandon abominable deeds, to love the poor, that Thou forgive me 
and show mercy to me and when Thou intendst to put people to trial Thou 
causes me to die unblemished and I beg of Thee Thy love and the love of one 
who loves Thee and the love for the deed which brings me near to Thy love. 
Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: It is a truth, so learn it and 
teach it.<br>
Transmitted by Ahmad, Tirmidhi who said: <b>This is a hasan sahih hadith</b> 
and I asked Muhammad ibn Isma'il about this hadith and he said: <b>It is a 
sahih hadith</b>. (<i>Tirmidhi Hadith</i>, Number 245; ALIM CD-ROM Version)

<P>
The Quran also applies human qualities and characteristics to Allah: 
<P>
<B>The Quran Gives Allah A Face</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
"Every one upon it will disappear while <B>your Lord's face</B> 
will remain full of majesty and splendor." S. 55:26-27

"The ones who swear allegiance to you merely swear allegiance to God.

<P>
<B>The Quran Gives Allah An Eye</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
Allah said: "Granted is thy prayer, O Moses! And indeed We conferred 
a favour on thee another time [before]. Behold! We sent to thy mother, 
by inspiration, the message: 'Throw [the child] into the chest, and 
throw [the chest] into the river: The river will cast him up on the 
bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an 
enemy to him: But I endued thee with love from Me: And [this] in order 
that thou mayest be reared under <B>Mine eye</B>.'" S. 20:36-39

</blockquote>

<P><B>The Quran Seats Allah On The Throne</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
"He it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days; 
<B>then He mounted the throne</B>." S. 57:4 
- M. M. Pickthall English Translation 
</blockquote>
<P>
The fact that Allah mounts the throne implies movement. To say 
that mounting the throne is a metaphorical term indicating that 
Allah assumed sovereign control over the creation leaves more 
problems. If it is only after creation that Allah assumed sovereign 
rulership then this implies that previous to this specific point 
in time Allah was not sovereign. Yet, if he was not sovereign prior 
to this point then this implies a change in the nature and experience 
of Allah. Yet, if Allah can change and experience new events this 
implies that he is not omniscient. We leave it to the Muslims to 
solve this paradox. 
<P>
<p>The Quran provides proof that the throne is actually literal:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
  &quot;And the angels will be on its sides, and eight will, 
  that Day, <b>bear the Throne of thy Lord above them</b>.&quot; S. 69:17
</blockquote>

<p>That there are eight angels bearing Allah's throne strongly suggests that Allah is 
literally sitting on an actual throne, a point which the so-called sound hadiths further 
substantiate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:<br>
While Allah's Apostle was sitting, a Jew came and said, "O Abul Qasim! One 
of your companions has slapped me on my face." The Prophet asked who that 
was. He replied that he was one of the Ansar. The Prophet sent for him, and 
on his arrival, he asked him whether he had beaten the Jew. He (replied in 
the affirmative and) said, "I heard him taking an oath in the market saying, 
'By Him Who gave Moses superiority over all the human beings.' I said, 
'O wicked man! (Has Allah given Moses superiority) even over Muhammad?' <!-- ?' 
is missing in the print and online version, added by JK for smoother reading -->
I became furious and slapped him over his face." The Prophet said, "Do not 
give a prophet superiority over another, for on the Day of Resurrection all 
the people will fall unconscious and I will be the first to emerge from the earth, 
<b>and will see Moses standing and holding one of the legs of the Throne</b>. 
I will not know whether Moses has fallen unconscious or the first unconsciousness 
was sufficient for him." (<i>Sahih Al-Bukhari</i>, Volume 3, Book 41, 
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/041.sbt.html#003.041.595">Number 595</A>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moses holding on to one of the legs of Allah's throne provides further 
substantiation that Allah is literally sitting on it.</p>

<p><b>The Quran Gives Allah A Shin</b>
<p>
<blockquote>
  &quot;The Day that <b>THE SHIN SHALL BE LAID BARE</b>, 
  and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able,-&quot; S. 68:42

<p>According to the Ahadith the Shin refers to Allah's Shin:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>

  <p>
  I heard the Prophet saying, &quot;<b>ALLAH WILL LAY BARE HIS SHIN</b>, and then all 
  the believers, men and women, will prostrate themselves before Him; but there will remain
  those who used to prostrate in the world for showing off and for gaining good reputation.
  Such a one will try to prostrate himself (on the Day of Judgment) but his back (bones)
  will become a single (vertebra) bone (so he will not be able to prostrate).&quot; (Sahih

  say. <b>&#145;THE SHIN,&#146; AND SO ALLAH WILL THEN UNCOVER HIS SHIN</b>

Oh that, the Prophet said, "This is easier." (<i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 9:503)

<B>Allah Has A Hand and Fingers</B>

Narrated Abu Huraira: 
<P>
Allah's Apostle said, <B>"Allah's Hand is full</B>, and (its fullness) 
is not affected by the continuous spending, day and night." He also 
said, "Do you see what He has spent since He created the Heavens and 
the Earth? Yet all that has not decreased what is <B>in His Hand</B>." 
He also said, "<B>His Throne is over the water and in His other Hand

He will)." (See Hadith No. 206, Vol. 6) (<i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 9:508)

A Jew came to the Prophet and said, "O Muhammad! Allah will hold the 
heavens on <B>a Finger</B>, and the mountains on <B>a Finger</B>, 
and the trees on <B>a Finger</B>, and all the creation on <B>a Finger</B>, 
and then He will say, 'I am the King.' " On that Allah's Apostle smiled 
till his premolar teeth became visible, and then recited:-- 
<P>
'No just estimate have they made of Allah such as due to him... (39.67) 
'Abdullah added: Allah's Apostle smiled (at the Jew's statement) 
expressing his wonder and believe in what was said. (<i>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 9:510)

A man from the people of the scripture came to the Prophet and said,

<B>Allah Actually Writes</B>
<P>
The following is taken from the Forty Hadith Qudsi:
<P>
<blockquote>
On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), 
who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said:
<P>
When Allah decreed the Creation <B>He pledged Himself by writing 
in His book which is laid down with Him:</B> My mercy prevails 
over my wrath.
<P> 
It was related by Muslim (also by al-Bukhari, an-Nasa'i and Ibn Majah). 
(<I>Hadith Qudsi 1</I> - see <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/hadithqudsi.html">the following link</a>.)
<P>
Narrated Abu Huraira: 
<P>
The Prophet said, "When Allah created the Creation, <B>He wrote in 
His Book--and He wrote (that) about Himself, and it is placed with 
Him on the Throne</B>--'Verily My Mercy overcomes My Anger.'" 
(<I>Sahih al-Bukhari</i> 9:501)
</blockquote>

<P>
The following hadiths are taken from <i>Al-Ahadith Al-Qudsiyyah - 
Divine Narratives</i> translated by Dr. Abdul Khaliq Kazi &amp; 
Dr. Alan B. Day, published by Dar Al Kitab Arabi - USA, 1995: 
<P>
<B>Allah Has A Waist</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>Hadith 34:</B>
<P>
Abu Hurayra narrated that the Prophet said: Allah created mankind 
and when He had finished, the womb stood up <B>and took hold of 
Allah's waist</B>. <B>Allah: Stop!</B> The womb said: I seek 
Thy refuge from being severed. Allah said: Would you not be happy 
if I do good to one who does good to you and sever links with one 
who severs links with you. The womb said: Yes my Lord. Allah said: 
And so shall it be.
<P>
Abu Hurayra said: Read if you like the following verse:
<P>
Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in 
the land sever your ties of kinship? <I>Qur'an: 47.22 [Bukhari] (p. 65)</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Allah Has A Visible Form</B>
<P>
<blockquote>
<B><P>Hadith 43:</B>
<P>
Ibn Abbas reported that the Prophet said: <B>My Lord came to me 
in the best form</B>, whilst I was asleep, and said: O Muhammad, 
do you know what the angelic assembly is disputing about? I said: 
I do not!
<P>
<B>Then Allah placed His Hand between my shoulders until I felt 
Its coolness in my chest</B> and I became aware of what was happening 
in Heaven and on earth... [<I>Al-Tirmidhi</I>] (pp. 82-83)
<P>
<B>Hadith 134:</B>
<P>
Jabir b. Abdullah narrated that the Prophet said: Whilst the people 
of Paradise were enjoying their blissful state, a light will appear 
above them. They will raise their heads and lo! <B>The Lord has risen 
above them and would say: </B>Peace be upon you, O people of Paradise! 
That would be in accordance with the Qur'anic verse <I>"Peace! A word 
from the Merciful Lord"</I> (Qur'an: 36:58). The Prophet said: 
<B>Then Allah would look at them and the people will look at Him</B>, 
and they will not be distracted by the joys of Paradise <B>as long 
as they were looking at Him, until Allah became veiled from them.</B> 
His Light and Blessing over them will remain in their dwellings. 
[<I>Ibn Majah</I>] (p. 191)
</blockquote>
<P>
Interestingly, this hadith indicates that Allah is not visibly present 
in Paradise. Only his light and blessings are present with believers. 
The fact that Allah appears to Paradise dwellers and then disappears 
from their sight implies that Allah is also not omnipresent. 
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>Hadith 113:</B>
<P>
Abu Hurayra narrated that some people said to the Prophet:
<P>
O Messenger of Allah, <B>shall we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement?</B><br>
He said: Do you have any doubt about seeing the sun when it is not 
covered by the clouds?<br>
They said: No, O Messenger of Allah!<br>
Do you have any doubt about seeing the moon on the night of the full moon, 
when it is not covered by clouds?<br>
They said: No, O Messenger of Allah!<br>
<B><I>Then likewise you shall see Him on the Day of Judgement</I></B>...
<P>
And this nation will remain along with its hypocrites, <B>and Allah 
would come to them IN A FORM OTHER THAN THE ONE THEY KNOW</B>, and 
would say "I am your Lord". They would say: We seek refuge in Allah 
from you. This is our place until our Lord comes to us. <B>And when 
our Lord comes to us, WE SHALL RECOGNISE HIM.</B>
<P>
<B>Then Allah will come to them IN THE FORM THAT THEY KNOW</B>, and 
would say "I am your Lord". They would say: "You indeed are our Lord", 
and they would follow Him...
<P>
The man would say: O my Lord, do not make the most unfortunate of 
your creatures! And he will continue to supplicate <B>until Allah 
laughed. When Allah laughed</B>, He gave him permission to enter... 
[Bukhari] (pp. 158-161)
</blockquote>
<P>
According to this hadith Allah has a form in which Muslims are expected 
to know and recognize on the Day of Judgment. Furthermore, Allah is said 
to have laughed, which implies that he either assumes a form where he 
gives off the impression that he is actually laughing or Allah in fact 
has a mouth! In fact, one hadith claims that Muhammad laughed at Allah 
laughing:
<P>
<blockquote>
"... Man would say: 'O my Lord, <B>do you mock me</B>, and You are 
the Lord of the Universe?'
<P>
"Ibn Mas'ud (the narrator) laughed and said: 'Do you not want to ask me 
what makes me laugh?' The listeners then said: 'What makes you laugh?' 
He said: '<B>This is how the Prophet laughed</B> and the Companions asked: 
"What made you laugh, O Apostle of Allah?" The Prophet said: "<B>I laughed 
on the account of the laughter of the Lord of the Universe at the man 
asking</B>: Do you mock me and You are the Lord of the Universe?"
<P>
"'Allah would then say: "<B>I do not mock you</B>; I have power over 
what I will"'..." (Hadith 117, p. 169)
</blockquote>
<P>
What is most disturbing is not that Allah laughed, but that someone 
could actually stand before the Holy God and accuse him of mockery.
<P>
In a book commonly held to be authored by Sunni Muslim scholar, Imam Ahmed Ibn Hanbal, 
"Kitab Al-Sunnah," we find the following interesting narrations:
<P>
<blockquote>
... when He Most Blessed and Exalted sits on the Kursi [throne], <b>a squeak is heard 
like the squeak of a new leather saddle</b>. (Ibid., Volume 1, p. 301 - Ibn al-Qayyim 
Publishing House, published in two volumes, Dammam, Saudi Arabia, 1986; bold emphasis ours)
<P>
Allah wrote the Torah for Moses with His hand <b>while leaning back on a rock</b>, 
on tablets of pearl, <b>and the screech of the quill could be heard</b>. There was 
no veil between Him and him, ... (Ibid., Volume 1, p. 294; bold emphasis ours)
<P>
The angels were created from the light <b>of His two elbows and chest</b>, ... 
(Ibid., Volume 2, p. 510; bold emphasis ours)
<P>

</blockquote>
<P>
Note what the following Muslim translator states in relation to Allah 
having a face, hands etc.:
<P>
<blockquote>
[1] All that has been revealed in Allah's Book [the Qur'an] as regards 
the [Sifat...] Qualities of Allah..., the Most High,- <B>like His Face, 
Eyes, Hands, Shins, (Legs), His Coming, His Istawa (rising over) His 
Throne and others</B>; His Qualities or all that Allah's Messenger... 
qualified Him in the true authentic Prophet's Ahadith (narrations) as 
regards His Qualities like [<B>Nuzul... His Descent or His laughing 
and others etc</B>. <B>The religious scholars of the Qur'an and the 
Sunna believe in these Qualities of Allah and they confirm that these 
are really His Qualities, without Ta'wil... (interpreting their meanings 
into different things etc.)</B> or Tashbih... (giving resemblance or 
similarity to any of the creatures) <B>or Ta'til... (i.e. completely 
ignoring or denying them i.e. there is no Face, or Eyes or Hands, or 
Shins etc. for Allah)</B>. These Qualities befit or suit only Allah 
Alone, and He does not resemble any of (His) creatures. As Allah's 
Statements (in the Qur'an): (1) "There is nothing like unto Him, and 
He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer" (V.42:11). (2) There is none 
comparable unto Him (V.112:4). (Al-Imam Zain-ud-Din Ahmad bin Abdul 
Lateef Az-Zubaidi, <I>The Translation of the Meanings of Summarized Sahih 
Al-Bukhari Arabic-English</I>, Translated by: Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan 
[Maktaba Dar-us-Salam Publishers &amp; Distributors, Riyadh Saudi Arabia], 
p. 842)
</blockquote>
<P>
This next quote is quite interesting. After mentioning those who seek the face 
of Allah, the author writes:
<P>
<blockquote>
... Meaning they want to see Allah's face (because that is the greatest 
pleasure for the people of Paradise). <b>The Qur'an and the Sunnah affirm 
that Allah has a face, two hands, fingers, and two eyes</b>. Some people 
deny these attributes because they incorrectly suppose that by affirming 
them <b>they are humanizing Allah</b>. Such an argument is only valid 
for those who would say, for example, "Allah has hands like ours (?)" Such 
a statement is not allowed because it qualifies Allah's attributes without 
evidence from the Qur'an or the Sunnah. It would also be in contradiction 
to the Qur'anic verse: <b>&lt;There is nothing that is like Him, and He is The 
Ever-Hearing, The Ever-Seeing&gt;</b>. Thus we must affirm the attributes 
that Allah, and/or his Messenger have affirmed; we must believe that these 
attributes befit the Magnificence, and Glory of Allah; and we are not 
allowed to qualify these attributes unless Allah, and/or his Messenger have 
done so for us. (Waleed K.S. Al-Essa, <i>Authentic Supplications Of the 
Prophet</i> [A Daar of Islamic Heritage Publication, P.O. Box 831415, 
Miami, FL. 33283, 1993], p. 59, n. 145; bold emphasis ours)
</blockquote>
<P>
Moreover, the English translation of Sunan Abu Dawud has a note stating 
that the view that Allah literally descends and ascends, and that he actually 
does have hands, shin etc., is the position held by the majority of scholars:
<P>
<blockquote>
700. It should be noted that the verses and the traditions which indicate 
the actions and qualities of Allah like those of men should be interpreted 
literally without knowing how (<i>bila kaif</i>) they are. Abu Hanifah was 
once asked about the descending of Allah to the lowest heaven. He replied: 
He descends but how He descends is not known to us. <u>This is the view 
held by the majority of scholars and traditionists. Moreover, it is not advisable 
to interpret such traditions figuratively</u>. As the essence of Allah is not 
similar to man, His actions and qualities too do not correspond to those 
of man. How Allah acts is beyond the understanding of man. Hence it is 
better to believe in the actions and attributes of Allah as they are mentioned 
in the texts ('<i>Awn al-Ma'bud</i>, I, 506-507) (<i>Sunan Abu Dawud</i>, 
English Translation with Explanatory Notes by Prof. Ahmad Hasan [Sh. 
Muhammad Ashraf Publishers, Booksellers & Exporters; Lahore, Pakistan, 
1984], Volume I, II. Kitab Al-Salat (Book of Prayer), Chapter 462: Which 
Part of Night is Better (For Prayer)?, p. 346; underline emphasis ours)
</blockquote>
<P>
The late Iranian Islamic scholar Ali Dashti also mentioned a few Muslims 
who took the above descriptions from the Quran quite literally:
<P>
<blockquote>
Many Moslems, however, have had rigid minds. Such men only accepted 
interpretations which are confirmed by Hadiths, and they considered any use 
of reason in religious matters to be misleading and impermissible. They took 
the above quoted Qur'anic phrases literally and believed that God possesses 
a head, mouth, eyes, ears, hands, and feet just like those of a human being. 
In the opinion of Abu Ma'mar al-Hodhali (d. 236/850), a preacher in Baghdad, 
<b><u>anyone who denied this belief was an infidel</u></b>. Adherents 
of the school of the famous traditionist and lawyer Ahmad b. Hanbal 
(164/780-241/855) have stuck to the same unthinking literalism ever since. 
The school's chief later exponent, Ahmad b. Taymiya, was so fanatical that 
he called the Mo'tazelites infidels and Ghazali a heretic; on one celebrated 
occasion, after quoting the Qor'an in a sermon, he said to the congregation 
as he stepped down from the pulpit of the Great Mosque at Damascus, 
"<b><u>God will step down from His throne in the same way as I am stepping 
down from this pulpit</u></b>."
<P>
These narrow-minded bigots considered not only the Mo'tazelite but even the 
Ash'arite theologians to be un-Islamic and condemned any sort of divergence 
from their own crudely simplistic views as pernicious innovation. Abu 'Amer 
ol-Qorashi, a Moor from Majorca who died at Baghdad in 524/1130, declared 
that it was heretical to understand the sentence "There is nothing similar 
to Him" in verse 9 of <i>sura</i> 42 (<i>osh-Showra</i>) as meaning what it 
says; it meant, in his opinion, that nothing resembles God in respect of His 
divinity, <b><u>because "God possesses limbs and organs like yours and 
mine</u></b>." As proof of God's possession of such limbs and organs, Abu 
'Amer ol-Qorashi cited the description of the last judgement in verse 42 of 
<i>sura</i> 68 (<i>ol-Qalam</i>) "On the day when the leg will be bared and 
they will be bidden to kneel but cannot," <b><u>and then slapped his thigh 
and said, "God has legs just like mine</u></b>." (Dashti, <i>23 Years: A 
Study of the Prophetic Career of Muhammad</i> [Costa Mesa, Ca. 1994; Mazda 
Publishers], pp. 157-158; bold and underline emphasis ours)
</blockquote>
<P>
Therefore, according to these Islamic sources a Muslim cannot just claim 
that the Qualities of Allah, His Face, Hands etc. are simply metaphorical. 
A Muslim must affirm that these things are actual. Yet, at the same time 
a Muslim must not assume that Allah's Face, Hands, Feet etc. are anything 
like what we see and find in creation.
<P>
In light of these preceding factors we are left with two possibilities:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Allah has an actual body. If so, this either makes Allah an exalted 
and glorified man. Or, Allah's body is spiritual not material. If so, 
then this implies that Allah cannot be omnipresent, spaceless or timeless. 
Hence, the dimensions of time, space and matter become binding upon Allah. 
This being the case we end up with a Greek pagan concept where both God 
and matter are eternal!</LI>
<P>
<LI>Allah assumes a visible body without this actually being his form. 
If so, then Muslims have no basis to reject the OT theophanies of God 
and the Incarnation of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. If Allah can appear 
visibly, then the God of the Bible can appear as a man and actually take 
on human nature at the Incarnation without Muslims having a legitimate 
basis to argue against this fact.</LI>
</OL>

<P>
In either case, Muslims have no valid objection against the doctrine 
of the Trinity and the Deity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 
<P>
Seeing that Islam poses more problems than solutions we invite Muslims 
to embrace the truth of God as recorded in the Holy Bible. The Holy Bible 
is the only inspired and inerrant Word of God for all times and for all 
men, leading everyone to the knowledge of God's complete truth.
<P>
Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Amen. Come Lord Jesus.

<b>NOTE:</b>

<P>Muslims might object at our uncritical use of certain hadiths 
in this article, which they may feel are not sound. In case such 
an argument is presented we simply would like to point out that 
the reliability of the Hadith is not the issue. The issue is that 
both the Quran and early Islamic scholarship affirm the visible 
and bodily nature of Allah. Hence, even if some of the hadiths 
were questionable this still would not refute our arguments. This 
is due to the fact that it is Muslims who wrote down even these 
weaker hadiths, affirming that these Muslims had no problem in 
attributing a body to Allah. Hence, no matter from what angle one 
looks at it the conclusion that Allah has a body becomes inescapable.
