										<h3>What are varicose veins?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									Varicose veins, which afflict 10% to 20% of all adults, are swollen, twisted, blue veins that are close to the surface of the skin. Because valves in them are damaged, they hold more blood at higher pressure than normal.  That forces fluid into the surrounding tissue, making the affected leg swell and feel heavy.<br><br>Unsightly and uncomfortable, varicose leg veins can promote swelling in the ankles and feet and itching of the skin.  They may occur in almost any part of the leg but are most often seen in the back of the calf or on the inside of the leg between the groin and the ankle.  Left untreated, patient symptoms are likely to worsen with some possibly leading to venous ulceration. <br>

										<h3>What causes varicose veins?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									The normal function of leg veins - both the deep veins in the leg and the superficial veins - is to carry blood back to the heart. During walking, for instance, the calf muscle acts as a pump, contracting veins and forcing blood back to the heart. <br><br>To prevent blood from flowing in the wrong direction, veins have numerous valves.  If the valves fail (a cause of venous reflux), blood flows back into superficial veins and back down the leg. This results in veins enlarging and becoming varicose.  The process is like blowing air into a balloon without letting the air flow out again-  the balloon swells.   <br><br>To succeed, treatment must stop this reverse flow at the highest site or sites of valve failure.  In the legs, veins close to the surface of the skin drain into larger veins, such as the saphenous vein, which run up to the groin.  Damaged valves in the saphenous vein are often the cause of reversed blood flow back down into the surface veins. <br>

										<h3>Why does it occur more in the legs?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									Gravity is the culprit.  The distance from the feet to the heart is the furthest blood has to travel in the body.  Consequently, those vessels experience a great deal of pressure. If vein valves can't handle it, the backflow of blood can cause the surface veins to become swollen and distorted.<br>

										<h3>Who is at risk for varicose veins?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									Conditions contributing to varicose veins include genetics, obesity, pregnancy, hormonal changes at menopause, work or hobbies requiring extended standing, and past vein diseases such as thrombophlebitis (i.e. inflammation of a vein as a blood clot forms.)  Women suffer from varicose veins more than men, and the incidence increases to 50% of people over age 50.<br>

											<p>
											

																	

									Varicose veins may ache, and feet and ankles may swell towards day's end, especially in hot weather.  Varicose veins can get sore and inflamed, causing redness of the skin around them.  In some cases, patients may develop venous ulcerations.<br>

										<h3>What are venous leg ulcers?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									Venous ulcers are areas of the lower leg where the skin has died and exposed the flesh beneath. Ulcers can range from the size of a penny to completely encircling the leg. They are painful, odorous open wounds which weep fluid and can last for months or even years. Most leg ulcers occur when vein disease is left untreated. They are most common among older people but can also affect individuals as young as 18. <br>

									ESES (pronounced SS) is an easy way to remember the conservative approach.  It stands for Exercise Stockings Elevation and Still. Exercising, wearing compression hose, elevating and resting the legs will not make the veins go away or necessarily prevent them from worsening because the underlying disease (venous reflux) has not been addressed.  However, it may provide some symptomatic relief.  Weight reduction is also helpful. <br><br>If there are inflamed areas or an infection, topical antibiotics may be prescribed. If ulcers develop, medication and dressings should be changed regularly. <br><br>There are also potentially longer-term treatment alternatives for visible varicose veins, such as sclerotherapy and phlebectomy.<br>

									A chemical injection, such as a saline or detergent solution, is injected into a vein causing it to “spasm” or close up. Other veins then take over its work. This may bring only temporary success and varicose veins frequently recur.  It is most effective on smaller surface veins, less than 1-2mm in diameter.<br>

											<p>
											

																	

									If the source of the reverse blood flow is due to damaged valves in the saphenous vein, the vein may be removed by a surgical procedure known as vein stripping.  Under general anesthesia, all or part of the vein is tied off and pulled out.  The legs are bandaged after the surgery but swelling and bruising may last for weeks.<br>

											<p>
											

																	

									Closure is used, like vein stripping, to eliminate reverse blood flow in the saphenous vein, but without physically removing the vein, and can be performed without general anesthesia.   Like other venous procedures, the Closure procedure involves risks and potential complications.  Each patient should consult their doctor to determine whether or not they are a candidate for this procedure, and if their condition presents any special risks.  Complications reported in medical literature include numbness or tingling (paresthesia) skin burns, blood clots, temporary tenderness in the treated limb.<br>

										<h3>What are the three main categories of veins?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									Deep leg veins return blood directly to the heart and are in the center of the leg, near the bones. Superficial leg veins are just beneath the skin.  They have less support from surrounding muscles and bones than the deep veins and may thus develop an area of weakness in the wall.  When ballooning of the vein occurs, the vein becomes varicose. Perforator veins serve as connections between the superficial system and the deep system of leg veins.<br>

										<h3>What is superficial venous reflux?</h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									Superficial venous reflux is a condition that develops when the valves that usually keep blood flowing out of your legs become damaged or diseased. This causes blood to pool in your legs. Common symptoms of superficial venous reflux include pain, swelling, leg heaviness and fatigue, as well as varicose veins in your legs.<br>

										<h3>What is the Closure&reg; procedure? </h3>
										
							

						

						
							
										
											<p>
											

																	

									The Closure procedure is a minimally invasive treatment for superficial venous reflux. A thin catheter is inserted into the vein through a small opening. The catheter delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy to the vein wall, causing it to heat, collapse, and seal shut.<br>

											<p>
											

																	

									During a stripping procedure, the surgeon makes an incision in your groin and ties off the vein, after which a stripper tool is threaded through the saphenous vein and used to pull the vein out of your leg through a second incision just above your calf. <br><br>In the Closure procedure, there is no need for groin surgery. Instead, the vein remains in place and is closed using a special (Closure) catheter inserted through a small puncture. This may eliminate the bruising and pain often associated with vein stripping (i.e., that may result from the tearing of side branch veins while the saphenous vein is pulled out). Vein stripping is usually performed in an operating room, under a general anesthetic, while the Closure procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, typically using local or regional anesthesia. <br><br>Three randomized trials of the Closure procedure vs. vein stripping, including the most recent multi-center comparative trial, show very similar results. In the multi-center comparative trial, the Closure procedure was superior to vein stripping in every statistically significant outcome. In the study, 80.5% of patients treated with the Closure procedure returned to normal activities within one day, versus 46.9% of patients who underwent vein stripping. Also, Closure patients returned to work 7.7 days sooner than surgical patients. Patients treated with the Closure procedure had less postoperative pain, less bruising, faster recovery and fewer overall adverse events.<br>

									Since valves can't be repaired, the only alternative is to re-route blood flow through healthy veins. Traditionally, this has been done by surgically removing (stripping) the troublesome vein from your leg. The Closure procedure provides a less invasive alternative to vein stripping by simply closing the problem vein instead. Once the diseased vein is closed, other healthy veins take over and empty blood from your legs.<br>

									As with any medical intervention, potential risks and complications exist with the Closure procedure. All patients should consult their doctors to determine if their conditions present any special risks. Your physician will review potential complications of the Closure procedure at the consultation, and can be reviewed in the safety summary. Potential complications can include: vessel perforation, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, phlebitis, hematoma, infection, paresthesia (numbness or tingling) and/or skin burn.<br>

									The most important step in determining whether or not the Closure procedure is appropriate for you is a complete ultrasound examination by your physician or qualified clinician. Age alone is not a factor in determining whether or not the Closure procedure is appropriate for you. The Closure procedure has been used to treat patients across a wide range of ages.<br>

									The vein simply becomes fibrous tissue after treatment. Over time, the vein will gradually incorporate into surrounding tissue. One study reported that 89% of treated veins are indistinguishable from other body tissue one year after the Closure procedure was performed. <br>
