<p>MICROSOFT TRANSLATOR</p>
<p>ONLINE SERVICE AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Dated: March 2016</p>
<p>Section 1 - Description of Services <br>
<br>
Microsoft Translator delivers automatic translation of text or speech into a specified language, and other language-related functionality (the &quot;Service&quot;). Microsoft provides access to the Service by means of the Microsoft Translator application programming
 interface (the &quot;API&quot;) to allow software applications, websites or other products (the &quot;Application&quot;) to interact with the Service. An Application does not include an interface that emulates the functionality or is substantially similar to the API. You may
 subscribe to the API for your Applications to interact with the Service by way of the Microsoft Azure Marketplace Service (the &quot;Marketplace Service&quot;). The Marketplace Service is an online market place located at
<a target="_blank" href="">https://datamarket.azure.com/home</a> where the Marketplace Service, catalogues, data, applications, software, sites, information, materials, content and updates are made available to you. The Marketplace Service is governed by the
 terms of the Microsoft Windows Azure Marketplace Agreement (the &quot;Marketplace Terms of Use&quot;) located at
<a target="_blank" href="https://datamarket.azure.com/terms">https://datamarket.azure.com/terms</a>.
</p>
<p>Section 2 - Acceptance of Terms <br>
<br>
This Online Service Agreement is a contract between you and the Microsoft Company listed in Section 23. This contract applies to your use of the Service, the API and any documentation, media, services, updates and other materials made available from time to
 time through the Microsoft Translator webpages of the Marketplace Service. You can view the most current version of this contract at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.aka.ms/TranslatorTOU">https://www.aka.ms/TranslatorTOU</a>. Microsoft may update this contract by posting new terms and conditions. The new terms and conditions will automatically take effect and amend your terms of use
 of the Service contract after 30 days from posting. If you do not agree to accept the new terms and conditions, you must stop using the Service within the 30-day period from the posting of the new terms and conditions. Your use of certain elements of the Service
 may be subject to additional guidelines, posted notices, codes of conduct, or the Marketplace Terms of Use. These are incorporated by reference into this contract.
<br>
<br>
By creating an account or accepting this contract, you represent that you are at least 18 years old or have reached the age of &quot;majority&quot; where you live, if that is not 18 years of age. If you are under 18 or have not reached the age of majority, your parent
 or legal guardian must set up an account on your behalf and accept this contract. Please note that Microsoft does not provide warranties for the Service. This contract also limits our liability. These terms are in sections 10 and 14. Please read them carefully.
</p>
<p>Section 3 - License <br>
<br>
During the term of your subscription and subject to your compliance with this contract, Microsoft provides you a non-exclusive, nontransferable, nonsublicensable, worldwide license to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>use the API and access the Service to embed the API and underlying content into the Application so that the Application can interface directly with the Service;
</li><li>use the API and access the Service to host and present results from the Service on the Application; and
</li><li>use the documentation, media, and other materials made available by Microsoft from time to time for use with the Service and API solely in support of you exercising your rights in this license.
</li></ol>
Microsoft will provide you with the means for obtaining unique access credentials to access the Service through the API solely for the purposes stated in this license. You are solely responsible for: (a) keeping your access credentials confidential; (b) any
 and all activities that occur under your access credentials, and (c) ensuring these credentials remain available to the appropriate person if one of more users leave the company. Microsoft cannot transfer your subscription from one account to another. A loss
 of credentials will require you to create a new account and news credentials and, potentially, to rewrite some part of your software. You must promptly notify Microsoft of any unauthorized use of your access credentials or any other breach of security. Microsoft
 will not be liable for any loss that you incur if someone else uses your access credentials, either with or without your knowledge. However, you could be held liable for losses incurred by Microsoft or another party if someone else uses your access credentials.
<p></p>
<p>Section 4 - Microsoft Marks <br>
<br>
During the term of your subscription, you will provide attributions to the Service as outlined on

https://www.aka.ms/TranslatorSupport</a> regarding such changes or deletions. Other than as provided in Section 8, or if required to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation, or legal process, Microsoft will not cancel, suspend or terminate your

</li><li>Knowingly transmit any virus, worm, defect, or any other item intended to destroy, surreptitiously interfere with, expropriate, or exert unauthorized control over any system or data or to defraud any person; and
</li><li>Remove, modify, or tamper with any notice or link that is incorporated into the Service.
</li></ol>

 internet domain, or IP address. Microsoft may at all times: (a) disclose any information as Microsoft deems necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; or (b) edit or to remove any information or materials, in
 whole or in part.
