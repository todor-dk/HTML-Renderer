<h2><span style="color: #c91e1e;">What is Tubidy?</span></h2>

It is stylized in so many genres using so many wondrous instruments that a person can listen to it keeping his or her own likes and interests at priority. And this particular categorizing of music brought forth the concept of musical genres, how it is performed on various platforms and stages and to how a person will simply just make a playlist and listen to his or her heart&#8217;s content, the music to their very own taste.</p>
<p>With the rise in Digital Media, Music has also seen a great deal of up gradation as to how it is listened on various mediums and distributed. Earlier music was heard on stage performances, operas, concerts, stereos, and walkmans, and so on. There were limited resources that catered to musical listening. But today music can be heard almost everywhere. When a person goes to a restaurant, a store, a hotel lobby etc. and he or she will hear some type of music playing. Every smartphone today has music player compartments, every laptop today makes a place for music, devices such as iPods, Bluetooth speakers, digital music players, portable track phones etc. cater to just pure music listeners. So basically Music is simply everywhere these days. And with the amazing invention that is the internet, obtaining Music has become such an easy task. There are online sharing portals, downloading portals and storage portals that provide music from all over the world, including all types and forms of music; from a small advertisement jingle to a remote folk song. So what does the internet not provide when it comes to music? Nothing, it has everything.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tubidy</em></strong> is one such amazing music la-la land on the web that users can make solid use of. Basically, Tubidy is a simple to use and totally free online music applicant that provides all music lovers with an astonishing and different experience in downloading music. Tubidy helps its users download various types of music-related media, like music videos, songs, and a long list of amazing music in general. It also allows the users to watch music videos on their smartphones. It is meant to be very easy to use because it is said to have simplified features and their music library is very easy to navigate though because it is kept in a neat, categorized order for users to understand. It was made by Tubidy Limited and provides music in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, and Turkish languages. Tubidy&#8217;s seller is Mobiventura Limited.</p>
<p>People who make use of Tubidy have a few other privileges too. They can make use of it to access their favorite music sure; but they can also listen to MP4, MP3 and many video files that are available on the internet and make use of Tubidy&#8217;s software without having to download a particular application. In order to provide their music lovers with their content in a neat, organized manner in various genres and categories, Tubidy makes use of Google&#8217;s Search Algorithm.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #c91e1e;">Tubidy App</span></h3>
<p>Tubidy, like mentioned, earlier can be heard without actually having to download an application as well. But, it is available for iOS and Android in the form of Apps too. For people who want to use it on their iOS, they need to buy iTunes first and then download Tubidy. It usually requires iOS 7.0 or later versions and is compatible with iPhones, iPads, and iPod touch for Apple. It is a free application. Tubidy Top Music is an Android application, that is also free and can be downloaded for Android devices via Google Play apps. This app provides playlists such as Indonesian Top Songs, Malaysian Top Songs, Thai Top Songs, Korean Top Songs, Chinese Top Songs, and Global Top Songs. It requires and works for Android version 2.3.3 and above.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #c91e1e;">Tubidy Music Engine</span></h3>
<p>There is also something called the Tubidy Search Engine or Tubidy Music Engine, that basically plays a search engine to look for music or music videos. For music video search, there is something called a Tubidy Music Video Engine. These search engines are available all over the internet, but users must be aware of the fake sites. Since Tubidy is one of a kind, it will definitely have several non-authentic versions to it as well. Hence, users must first make sure that they are completely aware of a particular website or portal before downloading any content from within it. It can carry certain types of vicious and harmful malware with it that will have the ability to completely destroy or cause certain types of damages to the devices the music lovers are using. Hence, it is always advisable that Users who are looking to download certain Tubidy related content, to look into other user reviews about various types of websites that provide such downloading facilities. This way they will be aware of any harmful viruses online and will avoid going to such websites.</p>
<p>Many websites make use of Tubidy&#8217;s music engine. One such site is called MP3 Downloads and is usually the first site to pop up when a user searches for Tubidy Music Engine. This site caters mostly to those users who are looking to download MP3 Tubidy files. But like mentioned previously, it is better to just check out the safety of the site before actually beginning to make use of it. This particular search engine is known as Tubidy S Engine MP3. The site has managed to provide almost 37590 songs in total for music lovers, and these songs were brought in keeping in mind the queries users made previously or asked for previously. Each page doesn&#8217;t show more than 10 song results and this they claim is due to certain API limit restrictions.</p>
<p>Before downloading any MP3 song from this website, the users can first check out its preview by clicking or pressing the play button to listen to it first. After he or she is satisfied that it is the right file they are looking for, they can click on the download button and start downloading from a long list of quality HD files, all MP3. YouTube files are all usually video based. And hence, MP3 Downloads first converts all these files for the users to download so that they do not have to do it by themselves. And also, these search options are based on previous search results their users already made on other search engines. So making that as a fundamental or base for their list of MP3 options, they have selected the videos from YouTube and converted them into MP3 files accordingly.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #c91e1e;">Tubidy Genres</span></h3>
<p>Tubidy tries to cater to its music lovers by providing almost every genre there is. This, however, can be limited to just music files and not music video files. Although they do have an extremely impressive Music Video list, they still have a much better Music or Songs list. Users can hence, download any song of their choice in any form they would like and then listen to it whenever they feel like it. There are however certain ratings that every Tubidy user must know of when it comes to certain songs. Tubidy is a more free and broadened music portal and hence some of their music is for people 12 years and above. There will be songs that will make references to alcohol, tobacco or drug use although they won&#8217;t be so frequent or constant. There will also be songs that will make references to gambling, casinos etc. also not very frequently, though, so there is that. Some songs will also make references to mild suggestive and mild mature themes that are not suitable for a certain group of listeners and this too, will not be a constant occurrence. Tubidy will also list out songs that will spell out themes such as realistic violence, sexual content and nudity (Especially in music videos and also some songs), Cartoon violence or fantasy violence, information about certain not so usually heard of medical treatments, profanity and crude language and humor and finally horror and fear related themes.</p>
<p>Like mentioned earlier, Tubidy does like to make sure that they have listeners from different corners of the world and to people who have access to them. Every person has his or her own interest, style and personality and many a time, art forms like music, dance, painting etc. depict the person&#8217;s personality basing on the kind of genres or styles they listen to, move along with or paint (with reference to the mentioned art forms). And hence, Tubidy doesn&#8217;t hold back on its content either, rather it believes in coming forth with disclaimers and warnings that certain type of music is not suitable for all listeners.</p>
