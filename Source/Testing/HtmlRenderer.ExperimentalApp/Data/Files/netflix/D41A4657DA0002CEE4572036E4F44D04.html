<p>[<strong>Last Updated: July 7th</strong>]</p>
<p>We’ve all been there. You&#8217;ve decided you’re going to watch a movie. You have the entirety of Netflix at your disposal, including even a pared down list of films you’ve already noted to watch at a future date. But then there’s the <em>choosing</em>. You’ve gotta find something that fits your mood, or something you and your friend/significant other/couch companion can agree on. You spend hours browsing, and by the time you stumble on something you think <em>maybe</em> is the one, it’s too late, you’re too tired, and indecision has won out.</p>
<p>Never fear, though, because we here at Collider have a guide to help you find the perfect Netflix choice. We’ve thumbed through the library and assembled a list of some of the best films currently available for streaming, so peruse our highlights below, which will be updated weekly and are currently up to date for July 2017. Maybe the perfect choice is right here.</p>

Propelled by <b>Yann Tiersen<\/b>\u2019s spellbinding score, the whimsical tale focuses on young Amelie Poulin (Tautou), who tries to counterbalance her quiet and lonely life with a keen sense of observation, and an elaborate belief in exacting justice for those around her in order to ensure their happiness. But what of her own?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eventually, Amelie becomes caught up with a cat-and-mouse game with a potential love interest, the quirky Nino (Kassovitz), which twirls them through Paris as they ascertain whether or not they should ever actually speak to one another. The dazzling movie is a visual feast and an emotional story about romance, shyness, colorful vigilantism, and connecting with the smallest pieces and pleasures of the world around us in ways that add up to something wonderful. <i>\u2014 Allison Keene<\/i><\/p>\n","embed":""},{"slug":"sunset-boulevard","title":"Sunset Boulevard","images":["http:\/\/collider.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/sunset-boulevard.jpg"],"content":"<p><strong>Director<\/strong>: Billy Wilder<\/p>\n<p><strong>Writer:<\/strong> Charles Brackett<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cast<\/strong>: William Holden, Gloria Swanson, Erich von Stroheim, Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Lloyd Gough, Jack Webb<\/p>\n<p><strong>Billy Wildler<\/strong>\u2019s 1950 film noir is a classic for a reason.
