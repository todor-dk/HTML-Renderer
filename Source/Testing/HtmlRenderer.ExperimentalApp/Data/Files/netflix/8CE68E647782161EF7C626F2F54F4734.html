<p align="justify">If the site is UP but you cant access the page, try one of the below solutions:</p>
<p><b>Browser Related Problems</b></p>
<div class="bullet"></div><p class="list-text">Force a full refresh for the site. This can be achieved by pressing CTRL + F5 keys at the same time on your favourite browser (Firefox, Chrome, Explorer, etc.)</p><div class="bullet"></div><p class="list-text">Try alternative urls such as movies.netflix.com, netflix.ca</p><div class="bullet"></div><p class="list-text">Clear the temporary cache and cookies on your browser to make sure that you have the most recent version of the web page. For instructions choose your browser : <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/how-to/clear-firefox-cache.html"><span class="firefox"></span></a> <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/how-to/clear-chrome-cache.html"><span class="chrome"></span></a> <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/how-to/clear-internet-explorer-cache.html"><span class="explorer"></span></a></p>

<p><b>Fix DNS Problems</b></p>
<p align="justify">A Domain Name System (DNS) allows a site IP address (192.168.x.x) to be identified with words (*.com) in order to be remembered more easily, like a phonebook for websites. This service is usually provided by your ISP.</p>
<div class="bullet"></div><p class="list-text">Clear your local DNS cache to make sure that you grab the most recent cache that your ISP has. For Windows - (Start > Command Prompt > type "ipconfig /flushdns" and hit enter). For details choose your operating system : <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/how-to/flush-dns-cache-in-windows.html"><span class="windows"></span></a> <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/how-to/flush-dns-cache-in-linux.html"><span class="linux"></span></a> <a href="http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/how-to/flush-dns-cache-in-mac.html"><span class="mac"></span></a></p>
<div class="bullet"></div><p class="list-text">If you can access a website at office or from a 3G network yet it's not working on your computer, it is a good idea to use an alternative DNS service other than your ISPs. <a href="http://use.opendns.com/" target="_blank" class="textlink">OpenDNS</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/" target="_blank"class="textlink">Google Public DNS</a> are both excellent and free public DNS services.</p>

<p class="ctext">Hi everyone, I'm so excited share my testimonies about how i got my ex husband back with the help of real spell caster online that is powerful.. My husband and I have been married for about 7 yrs now. We were happily married with two kids, a boy and a girl. 3 months ago, I started to notice some strange behavior from him and a few weeks later I found out that my husband is seeing someone else. He started coming home late from work, he hardly care about me or the kids anymore, Sometimes he goes out and doesn't even come back home for about 2-3 days. I did all I could to rectify this problem but all to no avail. I became very worried and needed help. As I was browsing through the internet one day, I came across a website that suggested that Dr Unity can help solve marital problems, restore broken relationships and so on. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and and told him my problems and he told me what to do and i did it and he did a spell for me. 28 hours later, my husband came to me and apologized for the wrongs he did and promise never to do it again. Ever since then, everything has returned back to normal. I and my family are living together happily again.. All thanks to Dr Unity. If you have any problem contact him and i guarantee you that he will help you. He will not disappoint you. Email him at: Unityspelltemple@gmail.com or call him on: +2348072370762..Natasha Hayes from London,UK.</p></div>
