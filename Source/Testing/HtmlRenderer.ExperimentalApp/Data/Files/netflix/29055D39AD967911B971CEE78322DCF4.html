I guess it'll all depend how I am in the house with different girls.<\\\/p><p><strong>The player he wants to emulate:<\\\/strong>Cody and Derrick. How smooth their season went is mind blowing. They were never a threat to go home. It was just crazy how it worked out for them. I'm more Cody in a way. Cody played a perfect game -- obviously not perfect because he didn't win. But the way he was with the girls -- no showmances, but he was comfortable with all of them, cuddling and just made all of them smile. He had a very good social game. Cody played a hell of a game.<\\\/p><p><strong>What comps will be his strong suit:<\\\/strong>Endurance, numbers. I'm great with numbers, which is going to shock people.

Or what we call southern hospitality, where we have a way of persuasion, and especially being a female, we can get you to do something we want you to do and get you to think it's your idea. So that's more of my strategy versus flat-out lying. If you flat-out lie in <em>Big Brother<\\\/em>, usually you get busted and usually you lose all the credibility you built up.<\\\/p><p><strong>Whether she's worried about how she'll be perceived:<\\\/strong>Not that I'm not worried about it, but I'm not going to allow that perception to dictate my game. I'm going to make sure the end result is aligned with my core values and that's important to me.

They have a lot of good qualities. With Frankie, his social game was incredible. He made friends. He made his house fun. Even when he put people on the block, they forgave him so quickly because he was so likable. And with Derrick, he did that same thing where he made a lot of big moves without houseguests realizing it was him. He was manipulative and strategic. He did a lot of behind the scenes work. And they both lied about what they did for a living, which I'm also going to do.<\\\/p><p><strong>Why she plans to lie about her job:<\\\/strong> I'm going to say I work in radio, which is absolutely true. I've done a lot of different things in radio. I've played a lot of roles. [I won't say] I've been an on-air radio personality because I don't want the other houseguest to think that I have got this giant fan base back home. I don't want that to put a target on my back for whatever reason it might. It might not. They might think it's really cool or they might not have an opinion on it at all or they might think it's really lame. But they could probably think all those things about the rest of my radio job I do. And I won't risk the target.<\\\/p><p><strong>The chances she'll enter a showmance:<\\\/strong> I don't know. I'm so torn. I've been against showmances for the longest but my mom has really been pushing it. She wants me to have a boyfriend and I'm like, I want to have $500,000. I can probably find a boyfriend easier once I have $500,000.  But if there's a guy in there that can make me laugh, it's something to pass the time, I guess. And it's always an alliance. There's pros and cons to a showmance. You want somebody who always has your back, but if the showmance puts a target on your back, are you doing yourself any favors?<\\\/p>\",\"alt\":\"bigbrother-11.jpg\",\"credits\":\"Bill Inoshita\\\/CBS\"}","{\"caption\":\"<p><strong>Age:<\\\/strong> 32<br><strong>Hometown: <\\\/strong>Lake Mills, Iowa.<br><strong>Current City: <\\\/strong>Plano, Texas<br><strong><\\\/strong><strong>Occupation: <\\\/strong>Construction Sales Rep<br><strong>His strategy:<\\\/strong>I'm going to try and win that first HOH.

They have a lot of good qualities. With Frankie, his social game was incredible. He made friends. He made his house fun. Even when he put people on the block, they forgave him so quickly because he was so likable. And with Derrick, he did that same thing where he made a lot of big moves without houseguests realizing it was him. He was manipulative and strategic. He did a lot of behind the scenes work. And they both lied about what they did for a living, which I'm also going to do.<\/p><p><strong>Why she plans to lie about her job:<\/strong> I'm going to say I work in radio, which is absolutely true. I've done a lot of different things in radio. I've played a lot of roles.

I don't want that to put a target on my back for whatever reason it might. It might not. They might think it's really cool or they might not have an opinion on it at all or they might think it's really lame.

The Montagues and Capulets are desperate to \"bring peace\" to their new city as a new prince takes over -- but each family is still eager to control all of the power. Imagine all your favorite Rhimes-esque soapy drama but with Elizabethan England costumes and luxurious set designs (the show was filmed on location in Spain last year). Oh, and don't forget all the affairs and romance too.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Sunday, June 4 at 10\/9c<\/p><p>The Los Angeles comedy scene of the 1970s gets explored in Showtime's (loose) adaptation of William Knoedelseder's book <em>I'm<\/em> <em>D<em>ying Up Here: Heartbreak &amp; High Times in Stand-Up Comedy's Golden Era.<\/em> <\/em>While the book chronicled the rise of such soon-to-be legends as Jay Leno, this series -- from Jim Carrey and starring Melissa Leo, RJ Cyler and Michael Angarano -- follows a group of unknowns as they struggle to make it big in Hollywood. The show does a mostly good job of making the drama interesting and the comedic moments land, though its speed-reading of heavy social movements, including women's lib, and inevitably hokey 70s nostalgia can get grating. Still, for people who love comedy -- and seeing the tears that go into creating it -- <em>I<\/em><em>'m Dying Up Here<\/em> is good, dirty fun. And no drink minimum!  <\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Monday<strong>, <\/strong>June 5 at 10\/9c<\/p><p>Ever wonder what it's like behind the scenes of <em>The View? Daytime Divas <\/em>may not give all the answers but it's a good approximation: The show is based on the book <em>Satan's Sisters<\/em> from former <em>View<\/em> host Star Jones and it's full of crazy, catty drama. It's got star power too: Vanessa Williams plays Maxine Robinson, creator of daytime show <em>The Lunch Hour; Everybody Hates Chris<\/em>' Tichina Arnold plays one of the co-hosts, Mo Evans; and rapper Eve and R&amp;B diva Patti LaBelle have recurring roles. <\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Sunday, June 11 at 9\/8c<br><br>Welcome to the seedy underworld of nail salons! Produced by Rashida Jones, the series follows five manicurists at the Nail Artisan of Manatee County in South Florida, where manis and pedis are merely a front for the money laundering going on for a nearby pain clinic. Niecy Nash plays Desna, the owner who cares for her mentally ill brother Dean (Harold Perrineau). Carrie Preston, Judy Reyes, Jenn Lyon and Karrueche Tran play the other manicurists, while Jack Kesy stars as Roller, the own of the shady pain clinic.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Thursday, June 22 at 10\/9c<\/p><p>Based on Stephen King's 1984 novella, <em>The Mist<\/em> is a 10-episode miniseries that follows the citizens of a small town in Maine as it gets slowly engulfed by the threatening titular mist, cutting the residents off from the rest of the world and sending the local area into chaos. In particular, the series focuses on the members of one family, the Copelands, who are dealing with the aftermath of a horrible crime. Frances Conroy, Morgan Spector and Alyssa Sutherland star.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Friday, June 23<br><br>From executive producer Jenji Kohan (<em>Orange Is the New Black<\/em>), Netflix's newest dramedy stars <em>Community<\/em>'s Alison Brie as Ruth Wilder, a down-on-her-luck actress who unwittingly auditions for an all-women's wrestling circuit called <em>GLOW<\/em> (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling). Marc Maron co-stars as coach Sam Sylvia.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:  <\/strong>Wednesday, July 5 at 10\/9c<\/p><p>From <em>Boyz n the Hood<\/em> director John Singleton, FX's newest addictive drama is set in 1983 Los Angeles, against the backdrop of the beginning of the crack cocaine epidemic. The story is told through a number of characters on a violent collision course, including a young, intelligent dealer (Damson Idris), a Mexican wrestler caught in the middle of a power struggle (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), a CIA operative (Carter Hudson) who gets involved with Nicaraguan Contras, and the daughter of a Mexican crime lord (Emily Rios).<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Monday, July 10 at 9\/8c<br><br>William Shakespeare will get the <em>A Knight's Tale<\/em> treatment. The 10-episode series follows a 20-something Shakespeare (Laurie Davidson) during the 16th century theater scene, which was <em>wild<\/em> back then. So wild that the show will be backed by contemporary tunes. We know what you're thinking: Why wasn't this called <em>The Young Bard<\/em>? The cast includes Olivia DeJonge, Ewen Bremner, Colm Meaney, Mattias Inwood, Jamie Campbell Bower, William Houston, Lukas Rolfe, Max Bennette and Jasmin Savoy Brown.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Tuesday, July 11 at 9\/8c<br><br>Inspired by former <em>Cosmopolitan<\/em> editor Joanna Coles, the drama stars Katie Stevens, Aisha Dee and Meghann Fahy as young employees trying to climb the fashion magazine ladder at the fictional <em>Scarlet<\/em> magazine. Melora Hardin plays Jacqueline, the editor-in-chief and Coles surrogate. Not to be confused with E!'s reality series <em>So Cosmo<\/em> about <em>Cosmopolitan<\/em> employees that actually stars Coles, who's now the chief content officer there.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Wednesday, July 12 at 9\/8c<br><br>An asteroid is on a collision course with Earth! No, this isn't <em>Armageddon the Show<\/em>. <em>Big Little Lies<\/em>' Santiago Cabrera and <em>Red Band Society's<\/em> Charlie Rowe star as tech billionaire Darius Tanz and MIT grad student Liam Cole, respectively, who inform Pentagon official Grace Barrows (Jennifer Finnigan) that they just discovered an asteroid is six months away from hitting Earth. The twist: the Pentagon already knows about it and is hiding it from the public. The drama comes from Alex Kurtzman, Bob Orci, Peter Lenkov, and <em>Necessary Roughness<\/em> creators Liz Kruger and Craig Shapiro.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Thursday, July 13 at 9\/8c<\/p><p>A British import coming to The CW this summer, the eight-episode <em>Hooten &amp; the Lady<\/em> follows two treasure hunters, the American Ulysses Hooten, played by Michael Landes, and the British Lady Alex Lindo-Parker, played by Ophelia Lovibond. Although they initially butt heads, the duo embarks on incredible adventures as they search for the world's greatest mysteries, like the location of the tomb of Alexander the Great.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Friday, July 21 at 10\/9c after <em>Descendants 2<\/em>; regular timeslot: Fridays at 8:30\/7:30c<br><br>Raven (Raven-Symone) and Chelsea (Anneliese van der Pol) are back in this <em>That's So Raven<\/em> spin-off!

Isaac Brown and Navia Robinson will play Raven's 11-year-old twins Booker and Nia. Jason Maybuam will play Chelsea's 9-year-old son Levi. Sky Katz plays Nia's best friend Tess.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Monday, July 24 at 10\/9c<\/p><p>Set in Midnight, Texas, the drama tells the story of the city's population of vampires, witches, psychics and well, anyone who doesn't quite fit in. The small town is a haven for outsiders, but when it's threatened by <em>other<\/em> outsiders, those who call Midnight, Texas, home must band together to form an unconventional family. The series, based on novels by Charlaine Harris (<em>True Blood<\/em>), stars Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud, Dylan Bruce, Arielle Kebbel, Sarah Ramos and Peter Mensah, among others.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Wednesday, Aug. 2 at 10\/9c<br><br>Forgive her, Father, for Mary Camden has sinned. Jessica Biel returns to TV for the first time since <em>7th Heaven<\/em> in this eight-episode limited series about Cora Tannetti (Biel), a young mother who inexplicably murders a stranger but doesn't know why. Bill Pullman stars as Harry Ambrose, the detective investigating the murder and Cora's true motives. The cast also includes Christopher Abbott as Mason Tannetti, Cora's husband, Abby Miller as Caitlin Sullivan, a cop whose personal connection to the Tannettis complicates the investigation, and Dohn Norwood as Dan Leory, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ambrose.<\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres: <\/strong>Wednesday, Aug. 16 at 9\/8c<\/p><p>Famed funnyman Marlon Wayans plays a version of himself in this sitcom about co-parenting. Wayans plays a guy named Marlon, a devoted if immature dad raising two kids with his ex-wife Angie. She's played by Essence Atkins, who'll have great chemistry with her co-star; the duo starred in goofball parodies <em>A Haunted House <\/em>and<em> Haunted House 2 <\/em>together. Angie will be as much of a mom to him as she will the children: Marlon is a big kid himself, giving his young'uns wacky advice and generally behaving like their slightly more responsible guardian while showering them with love.  <\/p>","<p><strong>Premieres:<\/strong> Friday, Aug. 18<\/p><p>After each tackling their personal demons in their own series, Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and Iron Fist (Finn Jones), will team up in Netflix's latest Marvel superhero series.
