Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/i-PnRci1FDS0TFdvnrP3OFR9foQ=/800x360/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ENAbNopEGtgCn_FYsYCugs1dy08=/1600x720/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

Here are the five we're most hyped about, so you can mark your calendar in advance.\n1. Star Trek: Discovery (Sept. 24, CBS All Access)\n\nIt's been a long road (sorry), but the latest Star Trek series is almost here, and everything we've seen so far, from the fierce first photo to the epic trailer, has our phasers set to pumped. With The Walking Dead's Sonequa Martin-Green as the first woman of color to lead the franchise and uncharted territory to explore, the iconic franchise is boldly going in a direction we can't wait to experience for ourselves. \n2. The Defenders (Aug. 18, Netflix)\n\nMarvel and Netflix's collaboration has given us three epic series -- and Iron Fist -- over the past three years, and The Defenders will finally bring all four heroes together for a team-up that may not have the special effects budget of an Avengers movie, but will undoubtedly feature just as much snark and ass-kicking. \nOkay, so we're really hoping that the show will be 90 percent Jessica and Luke relentlessly mocking Danny (and 10 percent them making out), but whatever your feelings on each of the four shows, it's thrilling to imagine Marvel's four \"street-level\" crime fighters joining forces, if only to see what kind of hallway brawl the stunt team comes up with. Defenders, assemble! \n3. The Tick (Aug. 25, Amazon Video)\nBehold good world, @serafinowicz is finally suited up for the first week on set. #TheTick pic.twitter.com/bjDlpWcULN— The Tick (@TheTickTV) March 10, 2017\n\nBen Edlund is bringing back his big blue bug for a new live-action comedy, courtesy of Amazon. Since the spooftastic superhero was originally designed as a parody of other comic book characters, Edlund and his team should have plenty of material to work with in the reboot, which stars a pitch-perfect Peter Serafinowicz in the titular, spoon-loving role. \n4. Future Man (Fall, Hulu)\n\nHunger Games star Josh Hutcherson heads to the small screen for this high-concept sci-fi comedy from executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Hutcherson stars as Josh Futterman, a janitor by day/world-ranked gamer by night who is tasked with preventing the extinction of humanity after mysterious visitors from the future proclaim him the key to defeating an imminent super-race invasion. The show also features Glenne Headly's last role -- the Dick Tracy actress died unexpectedly during production on the series, in which she played the mother of Hutcherson's character. \n5. The Deuce (Sept. 10, HBO)\n\nThe Wire creator David Simon is returning to HBO for a lavish new period drama set in 1970s New York, exploring the rise of the porn industry and the many players within it. James Franco pulls double duty as twin brothers Vincent and Frankie Martino, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal as entrepreneurial sex worker Candy. Seedy and seductive in equal measure, it looks like just the right blend of character drama and cultural specificity we've come to expect from Simon's work.\nWATCH: ‘Star Trek’ was filmed in a brewery, and other little-knowns"},"shares":{"facebook":144,"twitter":540,"google_plus":9,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":2,"total":699},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/laRsNvUveehR3adPUnEpVyEH2ns=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525130%2F88a90ced-c2e6-4c2d-a78f-a39bffb4e9ee.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/t40PcQ8Oxc6AE6K37Pu3ZDxYrMY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AqfJ7DKbuyBxjbwpxrGuxrygz_o=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TJ31iKV2BGEE1qGVWlYa7kSzUkc=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tcLIlE","display_title":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"z63nwNQ05E","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Mark your calendars!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017"},{"_id":"5964d8b528cc360acf000770","id":"2017/07/11/stranger-things-season-2-poster-new-release","title":"Turns out we'll get to see 'Stranger Things' Season 2 sooner than expected","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-07-11T13:53:53+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 13:53:53 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"590","sort_key":"1DuWxm","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/stranger-things-season-2-poster-new-release/","content":{"plain":"Things are getting Stranger this Halloween -- in fact, a few days earlier, on Oct. 27.

Hulu offers three tiers: standard at $7.99 per month, ad-free at $11.99 per month, and $39.99 per month for the latest live TV plan. \nHBO Now, the company's standalone service, also costs $14.99 per month on its own. You can also add a HBO subscription to Amazon Prime, DirecTV, and Sling TV for the same cost.\nThe hook here is that you can create a Hulu bundle that's perhaps more exciting to you than a cable subscription with HBO, or HBO Now by itself, or HBO combined with any of those other services. \nThe deals are big for Hulu as it tries to woo more cord-cutters to its service, competing with the likes of YouTube, Amazon Video, Netflix, and, of course, traditional cable subscriptions. A recent comScore report revealed that Netflix dominates in viewing times, commanding more than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \n\"By combining HBO's iconic programming with our world class user experience and deep content offering, Hulu is giving viewers easy and highly personalized access to the very best of television,\" Tim Connolly, senior VP and head of distribution and partnerships at Hulu, said in a statement. \n\"With this important new partnership, fans can now watch Game of Thrones live every Sunday, binge watch all six seasons of The Sopranos or catch up on Westworld alongside our live TV, sports, classic TV shows and Hulu originals — all without ever having to leave the Hulu app,\" he continued.\nHulu is also competing for subscribers by offering its own exclusive programming, such as The Handmaid's Tale. \nWATCH: 'Game of Thrones' cast blows up social media with Season 7 news"},"shares":{"linked_in":165,"facebook":106,"google_plus":8,"twitter":209,"total":488},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MYxOBJF5eRmsjMNZzagQWLVAU2o=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528282%2Fefc612ac-80a2-44f7-810e-6fb74cd80f2a.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IslvsTncVLgebE8FPLUhuPJXcZY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q_xkbYdyI3NuBCTr7wvKVdMCu60=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TfhS1RKpSm-j9b4rlr9ruxkVeVI=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tupERS","display_title":"Hulu will now offer HBO and Cinemax, but it's going to cost you","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"vxL0XMKnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Hulu's deal with HBO comes just ahead of the Games of Thrones premiere.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Hulu will now offer HBO and Cinemax, but it's going to cost you"},{"_id":"59652eb928cc365bb5000221","id":"2017/07/11/netflix-marvel-lucy-liu-luke-cage","title":"Lucy Liu set to direct 'Luke Cage' premiere, realizing dreams we didn't know we had","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-07-11T20:01:43+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:01:43 +0000","formatted_date":" 21 hours ago","formatted_shares":"289","sort_key":"1Dv1lR","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/netflix-marvel-lucy-liu-luke-cage/","content":{"plain":"Netflix isn't kidding about its commitment to diversity; not only does the platform boast stories about a mix of genders, sexual orientations, and races, but the Netflix team strives for diversity behind the camera, too -- like by getting film star Lucy Liu to direct the first episode of Luke Cage Season 2.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Defenders' poster is basically a tough Snapchat selfie\n“What a thrill to collaborate with Marvel and Netflix, two industry titans, who paint our world with inspiring stories and beguiling characters,” Liu said in a press release. “It is such an honor to work with such a passionate and fearless team.”\nLiu currently stars on CBS's Elementary as Dr. Joan Watson, and has two film releases this year.

His writing coupled with Bá's signature art style created a book that earned accolades and Eisner Awards – the comic equivalent of an Oscar or Grammy.\nWay took to Instagram to announce this exciting development.  \n    It's really happening! #umbrellaacademy #netflix #darkhorsecomics A post shared by Gerard Way (@gerardway) on Jul 11, 2017 at 2:28pm PDT\n\"I couldn’t think of a better place for the vision Gabriel Bá and myself had when creating the comic, and cannot wait for people to experience that world as a live action show,” Way said in a press release from Universal Cable Productions and Dark Horse Entertainment, the company that originally published the comic.\nAnd yes, you read that correctly. Even though this may seem like a perfect opportunity for an animated series, The Umbrella Academy will indeed be live action. Seems like it may be a miss for source material so dependent on illustration, but we'll reserve judgement until we get a trailer. \nFor now, let's just rejoice that this is actually happening. \nWATCH: 7 more things you didn't know about 'Planet of the Apes'"},"shares":{"facebook":94,"google_plus":3,"linked_in":2,"twitter":182,"pinterest":2,"total":283},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FraYFTqSI0me3femFwhncxFWUSo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F533280%2F5d5e78fb-2b46-4e00-ae88-6baeb8505e5d.jpeg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lpyVt4vKj2J9ES3AbXLgeTckz8Y=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51146%2Fd472c693-ae80-4d3b-9428-b204d195afc1.jpeg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mCDaee0srb-LpVRk1sT_Zm5DBvo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51146%2Fd472c693-ae80-4d3b-9428-b204d195afc1.jpeg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XGLLw0bLDiQ5Bri3Zagz6f5jTZk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51146%2Fd472c693-ae80-4d3b-9428-b204d195afc1.jpeg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iWNuvmSYsI5OISVjZk--XUZIRvk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51146%2Fd472c693-ae80-4d3b-9428-b204d195afc1.jpeg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RroM8GxOtw3_7en8GB8Np9QSgns=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51146%2Fd472c693-ae80-4d3b-9428-b204d195afc1.jpeg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sNu9pr","display_title":"Netflix is adapting the brilliant comic from the guy who fronted My Chemical Romance","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG5RzoNv","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"We are so, so excited about \"The Umbrella Academy.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Netflix is adapting the brilliant comic from the guy who fronted My Chemical Romance"},{"_id":"59652eb928cc365bb5000221","id":"2017/07/11/netflix-marvel-lucy-liu-luke-cage","title":"Lucy Liu set to direct 'Luke Cage' premiere, realizing dreams we didn't know we had","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-07-11T20:01:43+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:01:43 +0000","formatted_date":" 21 hours ago","formatted_shares":"289","sort_key":"1Dv1lR","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/netflix-marvel-lucy-liu-luke-cage/","content":{"plain":"Netflix isn't kidding about its commitment to diversity; not only does the platform boast stories about a mix of genders, sexual orientations, and races, but the Netflix team strives for diversity behind the camera, too -- like by getting film star Lucy Liu to direct the first episode of Luke Cage Season 2.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Defenders' poster is basically a tough Snapchat selfie\n“What a thrill to collaborate with Marvel and Netflix, two industry titans, who paint our world with inspiring stories and beguiling characters,” Liu said in a press release. “It is such an honor to work with such a passionate and fearless team.”\nLiu currently stars on CBS's Elementary as Dr. Joan Watson, and has two film releases this year.

The study found that three-quarters of U.S. moms (71%) admit to sneaking in TV “me-time” to keep up with their favorite shows in surprising ways and places.

Hulu offers three tiers: standard at $7.99 per month, ad-free at $11.99 per month, and $39.99 per month for the latest live TV plan. \nHBO Now, the company's standalone service, also costs $14.99 per month on its own. You can also add a HBO subscription to Amazon Prime, DirecTV, and Sling TV for the same cost.\nThe hook here is that you can create a Hulu bundle that's perhaps more exciting to you than a cable subscription with HBO, or HBO Now by itself, or HBO combined with any of those other services. \nThe deals are big for Hulu as it tries to woo more cord-cutters to its service, competing with the likes of YouTube, Amazon Video, Netflix, and, of course, traditional cable subscriptions. A recent comScore report revealed that Netflix dominates in viewing times, commanding more than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \n\"By combining HBO's iconic programming with our world class user experience and deep content offering, Hulu is giving viewers easy and highly personalized access to the very best of television,\" Tim Connolly, senior VP and head of distribution and partnerships at Hulu, said in a statement. \n\"With this important new partnership, fans can now watch Game of Thrones live every Sunday, binge watch all six seasons of The Sopranos or catch up on Westworld alongside our live TV, sports, classic TV shows and Hulu originals — all without ever having to leave the Hulu app,\" he continued.\nHulu is also competing for subscribers by offering its own exclusive programming, such as The Handmaid's Tale. \nWATCH: 'Game of Thrones' cast blows up social media with Season 7 news"},"shares":{"linked_in":165,"facebook":106,"google_plus":8,"twitter":209,"total":488},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MYxOBJF5eRmsjMNZzagQWLVAU2o=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528282%2Fefc612ac-80a2-44f7-810e-6fb74cd80f2a.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IslvsTncVLgebE8FPLUhuPJXcZY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E0tsY57--YEeaR5fBLZY41Kn8g4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_F2t836ugk_NzahT6UkCFap5qiU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YIdtuAzc6xFFMV55mkLdrpHeJk0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dsPZZS5nLgd7VCyKr0z7dglDRGU=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tupERS","display_title":"Hulu will now offer HBO and Cinemax, but it's going to cost you","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"vxL0XMKnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Hulu's deal with HBO comes just ahead of the Games of Thrones premiere.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Hulu will now offer HBO and Cinemax, but it's going to cost you"},{"_id":"595d7499f11b2c594a000089","id":"2017/07/05/netflix-most-viewed-comscore","title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","title_tag":null,"author":"Adario Strange","post_date":"2017-07-05T23:21:17+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 05 Jul 2017 23:21:17 +0000","formatted_date":"07/05/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1DsUVQ","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/netflix-most-viewed-comscore/","content":{"plain":"When it comes to streaming video on your TV, Netflix is king.  \nThat's the finding from a recent comScore report on over-the-top (OTT) content, which says that Netflix commands more viewing time than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \nSEE ALSO: Netflix rolls out new way to get you to watch more Netflix\nThe report goes on to reveal that the average U.S. Wi-Fi–enabled household streams an average of one hour and 40 minutes of Netflix content directly to their television on a daily basis. Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSjWqWkDINnhkXvQrnUvsNO8sTo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XKJTawuolV38Rzjm2JwfV9Fbybk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VaD72qGLTHS1EWmv_eqk_xqSiHs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q1Vb6EZBWpyB4tt3e1iKYIjIl_o=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

I played the first edition of Assassin's Creed the year I moved to Los Angeles to pursue my dream. At that moment I knew absolutely no one in the industry and could never have imagined that one day Ubisoft would ask me to take the world of Assassin's Creed and create an original story set in it as an anime series. If anyone tells you not to follow your passion in life they are wrong.\nThat's all Shankar had to say. There's no sense of how far along this project is -- or if work has even begun. But it's happening, and with Ubisoft's blessing.\nCastlevania -- which also leans on an art style reminiscent of anime -- comes to Netflix on July 7. We know that series takes a page from the games: it follows Simon Belmont, a vampire hunter, as he faces off against an army of monsters commanded by Dracula.\nAssassin's Creed will no doubt do that same thing, though which source Shankar draws from remains to be seen. There's a loose canonical chronology guiding the Assassin's series, but not all works are created equally.\nUbisoft's 2016 movie, for example, effectively re-wrote many of the series fictional trappings while sticking the the core \"Assassins vs. Templars\" conflict. And in a few months from now, Assassin's Creed Origins -- which is set in ancient Egypt -- will codify the beginnings of that conflict in a game that also re-thinks many of the series' core rules.\nSpeaking as a fan, this is great news. Last year's movie featured some beautiful cinematography and choreography -- as well as a largely coherent plot (something that has eluded Assassins games in the past) -- but ultimately it suffered for setting out to tell a story that was too big for a two-and-a-half hour movie to capture.\nNetflix has the ability to eliminate that problem. We don't yet know how many episodes there will be or the running time on each one, but the episodic format alone should help to de-mystify some of the deeply nerdy sci-fi embedded in Assassins stories. \nI think it's also smart for this to land with a streaming service rather than cable TV. Young people in general are quicker to embrace cord-cutting, and I'd wager that gamers are among those leading the charge. Given the ubiquity of Netflix apps on current-generation gaming consoles, this feels like a good fit for the audience.\nNow we just need to see if Ubisoft can deliver where 2016's movie fell short. Even without having seen Shankar's Castlevania treatment, there is reason to be hopeful. He also served as executive producer on a number of top-tier Hollywood productions, including The Grey, Dredd, and Lone Survivor.\nWATCH: 'Golden Girls' starring 4 best dog friends will be your favorite fluffy remake"},"shares":{"twitter":165,"google_plus":2,"facebook":18,"linked_in":2,"total":187},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KpbGE4ASRY_hMCnnZw6CtGf83Mg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527154%2Fc0d104b9-a3d6-4f07-9ade-fce0a02cd56d.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5HvpbalIbH3Z2DVeQ6sbBZa_Up0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TlD8xPa2YlHwFkTtNgjarRgUXIo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z0BJ-B_U5aD3uhIar6d0bztyFIA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rsgXKzu39ixzfQ-azofhjVQCHyQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8LWiYbnMCpj78c-gorvXqriYnGo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tMhLtc","display_title":"Netflix is the perfect home for an 'Assassin's Creed' anime series","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"NyanmAOnK9","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Here for this.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Netflix is the perfect home for an 'Assassin's Creed' anime series"},{"_id":"595b94999111ae2c3d0002a7","id":"2017/07/04/new-tv-shows-2017-defenders-star-trek-discovery","title":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017","title_tag":null,"author":"Laura Prudom","post_date":"2017-07-04T13:13:04+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 13:13:04 +0000","formatted_date":"07/04/2017","formatted_shares":"699","sort_key":"1Dspam","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/04/new-tv-shows-2017-defenders-star-trek-discovery/","content":{"plain":"We may be counting the days until the return of Game of Thrones, but there are plenty of brand new shows making their debut in the coming months. Here are the five we're most hyped about, so you can mark your calendar in advance.\n1. Star Trek: Discovery (Sept. 24, CBS All Access)\n\nIt's been a long road (sorry), but the latest Star Trek series is almost here, and everything we've seen so far, from the fierce first photo to the epic trailer, has our phasers set to pumped. With The Walking Dead's Sonequa Martin-Green as the first woman of color to lead the franchise and uncharted territory to explore, the iconic franchise is boldly going in a direction we can't wait to experience for ourselves. \n2. The Defenders (Aug. 18, Netflix)\n\nMarvel and Netflix's collaboration has given us three epic series -- and Iron Fist -- over the past three years, and The Defenders will finally bring all four heroes together for a team-up that may not have the special effects budget of an Avengers movie, but will undoubtedly feature just as much snark and ass-kicking. \nOkay, so we're really hoping that the show will be 90 percent Jessica and Luke relentlessly mocking Danny (and 10 percent them making out), but whatever your feelings on each of the four shows, it's thrilling to imagine Marvel's four \"street-level\" crime fighters joining forces, if only to see what kind of hallway brawl the stunt team comes up with. Defenders, assemble! \n3. The Tick (Aug. 25, Amazon Video)\nBehold good world, @serafinowicz is finally suited up for the first week on set. #TheTick pic.twitter.com/bjDlpWcULN— The Tick (@TheTickTV) March 10, 2017\n\nBen Edlund is bringing back his big blue bug for a new live-action comedy, courtesy of Amazon. Since the spooftastic superhero was originally designed as a parody of other comic book characters, Edlund and his team should have plenty of material to work with in the reboot, which stars a pitch-perfect Peter Serafinowicz in the titular, spoon-loving role. \n4. Future Man (Fall, Hulu)\n\nHunger Games star Josh Hutcherson heads to the small screen for this high-concept sci-fi comedy from executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Hutcherson stars as Josh Futterman, a janitor by day/world-ranked gamer by night who is tasked with preventing the extinction of humanity after mysterious visitors from the future proclaim him the key to defeating an imminent super-race invasion. The show also features Glenne Headly's last role -- the Dick Tracy actress died unexpectedly during production on the series, in which she played the mother of Hutcherson's character. \n5.

The buzz that's made the show such a hit was just building steam then -- and certainly not in time to make it Hall H-worthy.\nSEE ALSO: TV peaked exactly 4 years ago today, with this one 'Game of Thrones' episode\nHall H, prepare to go upside-down: With a year under its belt and a new season right around the corner, Netflix is moving into the big kids' room, bringing Stranger Things and a couple of original films to the 6,000-seat monolith where so many Comic-Con legends are born.\n\nNetflix has certainly been in San Diego for Comic-Con in years past, with their Marvel shows Luke Cage and The Defenders -- but those were in the smaller halls upstairs, in conjunction with the Marvel TV panels. The migration downstairs is all part of the massive influx of TV into Comic-Con, and those shows and networks have a lot more room to work with in Hall H now, as pirates continue to scare away the major film studios. \nAs the film studios' presence has dwindled, TV is taking over\n(Mashable has learned that Paramount, Sony and Universal/Legendary will once again not host Hall H panels this year, while Fox's plans are still taking shape. Definitely on board: Warner Bros. and Marvel, the only two major film studios to present in 2016.)\nAs the film studios' presence has dwindled, TV and streaming is taking over. Game of Thrones moved in to H a few years ago, and others (The Walking Dead) have followed suit.\nNetflix original films Bright (from Suicide Squad director David Ayer) and Japanese manga adaptation Death Note are hosting their very own Hall H panel on Thursday, a slot that would've hosted the likes of Paramount or Universal in years past. (Later that night, Netflix will host a \"surprise screening\" of \"an upcoming original film\" at the Horton Grand Theater -- gee, which one could it be?)\n\nStranger Things gets its turn with its very own Hall H panel on Saturday -- at 3 p.m., an interesting spot, immediately between when DC/Warner Bros. and Marvel/Disney went head-to head last year.\nNetflix will also host a convention-floor booth through the entire weekend, described as an \"interactive brand experience where [fans] will be surrounded by 360 Degrees of Netflix originals.\" And if that isn't enough, it's also creating \"The Netflix Experience\" at the Hilton Gaslamp, where fans will get even more sneak-peeks and swag.\nJeez, and we thought streaming was taking over Sundance!\nWATCH: 'Stranger Things' retold in 8-bit arcade fashion got us real nostalgic"},"shares":{"twitter":217,"facebook":49,"google_plus":3,"linked_in":1,"pinterest":3,"total":273},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9hTrK57pIUmN6XtFYhTlQsqnNDk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525020%2F04c35d51-5127-4bef-991a-e094ab2884ae.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pM0KrhSbNaj1-kuls-aKlWSsjgU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50342%2F967684d5-cf28-4718-a6ee-1384b078826a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VT6JgviFtV8qB8EQBVH7hrwH4GQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50342%2F967684d5-cf28-4718-a6ee-1384b078826a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IeKFG9P4wwhW2kdFOMrpMs2dBc8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50342%2F967684d5-cf28-4718-a6ee-1384b078826a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/g8QcbBZGbEJQCVXxhguH-IXMDqM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50342%2F967684d5-cf28-4718-a6ee-1384b078826a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sA3yISpu68meq5mKIfu-AzAMCQw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50342%2F967684d5-cf28-4718-a6ee-1384b078826a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tyUdsv","display_title":"'Stranger Things' is going where no Netflix show ever has: Comic-Con's Hall H","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xa50qy10Mg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"With only two movie studios at Comic-Con once again, TV is taking over Hall H in a big way.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Stranger Things' is going where no Netflix show ever has: Comic-Con's Hall H"},{"_id":"59555ed7f11b2c7769000153","id":"2017/06/29/sense8-netflix-canceled-special-finale","title":"'Sense8' will return for a two-hour special on Netflix because sometimes things work out","title_tag":null,"author":"Sasha Lekach","post_date":"2017-06-29T20:11:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 20:11:02 +0000","formatted_date":"06/29/2017","formatted_shares":"873","sort_key":"1DqHOl","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/29/sense8-netflix-canceled-special-finale/","content":{"plain":"It looks like the hashtags and petitions to bring back the canceled Netflix series Sense8 are working.

Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSjWqWkDINnhkXvQrnUvsNO8sTo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XKJTawuolV38Rzjm2JwfV9Fbybk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VaD72qGLTHS1EWmv_eqk_xqSiHs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q1Vb6EZBWpyB4tt3e1iKYIjIl_o=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

Here are the five we're most hyped about, so you can mark your calendar in advance.\n1. Star Trek: Discovery (Sept. 24, CBS All Access)\n\nIt's been a long road (sorry), but the latest Star Trek series is almost here, and everything we've seen so far, from the fierce first photo to the epic trailer, has our phasers set to pumped. With The Walking Dead's Sonequa Martin-Green as the first woman of color to lead the franchise and uncharted territory to explore, the iconic franchise is boldly going in a direction we can't wait to experience for ourselves. \n2. The Defenders (Aug. 18, Netflix)\n\nMarvel and Netflix's collaboration has given us three epic series -- and Iron Fist -- over the past three years, and The Defenders will finally bring all four heroes together for a team-up that may not have the special effects budget of an Avengers movie, but will undoubtedly feature just as much snark and ass-kicking. \nOkay, so we're really hoping that the show will be 90 percent Jessica and Luke relentlessly mocking Danny (and 10 percent them making out), but whatever your feelings on each of the four shows, it's thrilling to imagine Marvel's four \"street-level\" crime fighters joining forces, if only to see what kind of hallway brawl the stunt team comes up with. Defenders, assemble! \n3. The Tick (Aug. 25, Amazon Video)\nBehold good world, @serafinowicz is finally suited up for the first week on set. #TheTick pic.twitter.com/bjDlpWcULN— The Tick (@TheTickTV) March 10, 2017\n\nBen Edlund is bringing back his big blue bug for a new live-action comedy, courtesy of Amazon. Since the spooftastic superhero was originally designed as a parody of other comic book characters, Edlund and his team should have plenty of material to work with in the reboot, which stars a pitch-perfect Peter Serafinowicz in the titular, spoon-loving role. \n4. Future Man (Fall, Hulu)\n\nHunger Games star Josh Hutcherson heads to the small screen for this high-concept sci-fi comedy from executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Hutcherson stars as Josh Futterman, a janitor by day/world-ranked gamer by night who is tasked with preventing the extinction of humanity after mysterious visitors from the future proclaim him the key to defeating an imminent super-race invasion. The show also features Glenne Headly's last role -- the Dick Tracy actress died unexpectedly during production on the series, in which she played the mother of Hutcherson's character. \n5. The Deuce (Sept. 10, HBO)\n\nThe Wire creator David Simon is returning to HBO for a lavish new period drama set in 1970s New York, exploring the rise of the porn industry and the many players within it. James Franco pulls double duty as twin brothers Vincent and Frankie Martino, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal as entrepreneurial sex worker Candy. Seedy and seductive in equal measure, it looks like just the right blend of character drama and cultural specificity we've come to expect from Simon's work.\nWATCH: ‘Star Trek’ was filmed in a brewery, and other little-knowns"},"shares":{"facebook":144,"twitter":540,"google_plus":9,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":2,"total":699},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/laRsNvUveehR3adPUnEpVyEH2ns=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525130%2F88a90ced-c2e6-4c2d-a78f-a39bffb4e9ee.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/t40PcQ8Oxc6AE6K37Pu3ZDxYrMY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gHnmaNeWPOzIzsXB3-hrL1TSONs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YL5nQHBqSYm04pJJl_LSVA2cUiY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lBwwvBvw59D-daQi4vg5PkgLosY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZcIPvNltZaUBJV5FdXYH-TQCd5w=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tcLIlE","display_title":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"z63nwNQ05E","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Mark your calendars!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017"},{"_id":"5964d8b528cc360acf000770","id":"2017/07/11/stranger-things-season-2-poster-new-release","title":"Turns out we'll get to see 'Stranger Things' Season 2 sooner than expected","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-07-11T13:53:53+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 13:53:53 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"590","sort_key":"1DuWxm","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/stranger-things-season-2-poster-new-release/","content":{"plain":"Things are getting Stranger this Halloween -- in fact, a few days earlier, on Oct. 27.

Hulu offers three tiers: standard at $7.99 per month, ad-free at $11.99 per month, and $39.99 per month for the latest live TV plan. \nHBO Now, the company's standalone service, also costs $14.99 per month on its own. You can also add a HBO subscription to Amazon Prime, DirecTV, and Sling TV for the same cost.\nThe hook here is that you can create a Hulu bundle that's perhaps more exciting to you than a cable subscription with HBO, or HBO Now by itself, or HBO combined with any of those other services. \nThe deals are big for Hulu as it tries to woo more cord-cutters to its service, competing with the likes of YouTube, Amazon Video, Netflix, and, of course, traditional cable subscriptions. A recent comScore report revealed that Netflix dominates in viewing times, commanding more than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \n\"By combining HBO's iconic programming with our world class user experience and deep content offering, Hulu is giving viewers easy and highly personalized access to the very best of television,\" Tim Connolly, senior VP and head of distribution and partnerships at Hulu, said in a statement. \n\"With this important new partnership, fans can now watch Game of Thrones live every Sunday, binge watch all six seasons of The Sopranos or catch up on Westworld alongside our live TV, sports, classic TV shows and Hulu originals — all without ever having to leave the Hulu app,\" he continued.\nHulu is also competing for subscribers by offering its own exclusive programming, such as The Handmaid's Tale. \nWATCH: 'Game of Thrones' cast blows up social media with Season 7 news"},"shares":{"linked_in":165,"facebook":106,"google_plus":8,"twitter":209,"total":488},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MYxOBJF5eRmsjMNZzagQWLVAU2o=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528282%2Fefc612ac-80a2-44f7-810e-6fb74cd80f2a.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IslvsTncVLgebE8FPLUhuPJXcZY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E0tsY57--YEeaR5fBLZY41Kn8g4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_F2t836ugk_NzahT6UkCFap5qiU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YIdtuAzc6xFFMV55mkLdrpHeJk0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dsPZZS5nLgd7VCyKr0z7dglDRGU=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50687%2Ff54be561-d326-4c41-9791-37f56e53598e.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tupERS","display_title":"Hulu will now offer HBO and Cinemax, but it's going to cost you","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"vxL0XMKnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Hulu's deal with HBO comes just ahead of the Games of Thrones premiere.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Hulu will now offer HBO and Cinemax, but it's going to cost you"},{"_id":"59652eb928cc365bb5000221","id":"2017/07/11/netflix-marvel-lucy-liu-luke-cage","title":"Lucy Liu set to direct 'Luke Cage' premiere, realizing dreams we didn't know we had","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-07-11T20:01:43+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:01:43 +0000","formatted_date":" 21 hours ago","formatted_shares":"289","sort_key":"1Dv1lR","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/netflix-marvel-lucy-liu-luke-cage/","content":{"plain":"Netflix isn't kidding about its commitment to diversity; not only does the platform boast stories about a mix of genders, sexual orientations, and races, but the Netflix team strives for diversity behind the camera, too -- like by getting film star Lucy Liu to direct the first episode of Luke Cage Season 2.\nSEE ALSO: 'The Defenders' poster is basically a tough Snapchat selfie\n“What a thrill to collaborate with Marvel and Netflix, two industry titans, who paint our world with inspiring stories and beguiling characters,” Liu said in a press release. “It is such an honor to work with such a passionate and fearless team.”\nLiu currently stars on CBS's Elementary as Dr. Joan Watson, and has two film releases this year.

If anyone tells you not to follow your passion in life they are wrong.\nThat's all Shankar had to say. There's no sense of how far along this project is -- or if work has even begun. But it's happening, and with Ubisoft's blessing.\nCastlevania -- which also leans on an art style reminiscent of anime -- comes to Netflix on July 7. We know that series takes a page from the games: it follows Simon Belmont, a vampire hunter, as he faces off against an army of monsters commanded by Dracula.\nAssassin's Creed will no doubt do that same thing, though which source Shankar draws from remains to be seen. There's a loose canonical chronology guiding the Assassin's series, but not all works are created equally.\nUbisoft's 2016 movie, for example, effectively re-wrote many of the series fictional trappings while sticking the the core \"Assassins vs. Templars\" conflict. And in a few months from now, Assassin's Creed Origins -- which is set in ancient Egypt -- will codify the beginnings of that conflict in a game that also re-thinks many of the series' core rules.\nSpeaking as a fan, this is great news. Last year's movie featured some beautiful cinematography and choreography -- as well as a largely coherent plot (something that has eluded Assassins games in the past) -- but ultimately it suffered for setting out to tell a story that was too big for a two-and-a-half hour movie to capture.\nNetflix has the ability to eliminate that problem. We don't yet know how many episodes there will be or the running time on each one, but the episodic format alone should help to de-mystify some of the deeply nerdy sci-fi embedded in Assassins stories. \nI think it's also smart for this to land with a streaming service rather than cable TV. Young people in general are quicker to embrace cord-cutting, and I'd wager that gamers are among those leading the charge. Given the ubiquity of Netflix apps on current-generation gaming consoles, this feels like a good fit for the audience.\nNow we just need to see if Ubisoft can deliver where 2016's movie fell short. Even without having seen Shankar's Castlevania treatment, there is reason to be hopeful. He also served as executive producer on a number of top-tier Hollywood productions, including The Grey, Dredd, and Lone Survivor.\nWATCH: 'Golden Girls' starring 4 best dog friends will be your favorite fluffy remake"},"shares":{"twitter":165,"google_plus":2,"facebook":18,"linked_in":2,"total":187},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KpbGE4ASRY_hMCnnZw6CtGf83Mg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527154%2Fc0d104b9-a3d6-4f07-9ade-fce0a02cd56d.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5HvpbalIbH3Z2DVeQ6sbBZa_Up0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TlD8xPa2YlHwFkTtNgjarRgUXIo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z0BJ-B_U5aD3uhIar6d0bztyFIA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rsgXKzu39ixzfQ-azofhjVQCHyQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8LWiYbnMCpj78c-gorvXqriYnGo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50543%2F75d6d527-065a-4d5b-b61e-e7d88df80e5e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tMhLtc","display_title":"Netflix is the perfect home for an 'Assassin's Creed' anime series","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"NyanmAOnK9","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Here for this.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Netflix is the perfect home for an 'Assassin's Creed' anime series"},{"_id":"5964bdc2f11b2c012e000486","id":"2017/07/11/netflix-moms-sneak","title":"Breaking: Moms find time to sneak in Netflix just like everyone else","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-07-11T12:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 12:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"176","sort_key":"1DuTPG","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/netflix-moms-sneak/","content":{"plain":"Peak TV is how we connect with other people now, so what do you do if you've got no time to watch?\nNetflix conducted a study with over 1,000 moms in the U.S. about how they find time in their schedules to stream TV -- how they \"sneak\" in their streaming and why they do it.\nSEE ALSO: Netflix rolls out new way to get you to watch more Netflix\nAlmost all the women surveyed (97%) agreed that they had more “me time” before motherhood.

Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix.

Here are the five we're most hyped about, so you can mark your calendar in advance.\n1. Star Trek: Discovery (Sept. 24, CBS All Access)\n\nIt's been a long road (sorry), but the latest Star Trek series is almost here, and everything we've seen so far, from the fierce first photo to the epic trailer, has our phasers set to pumped. With The Walking Dead's Sonequa Martin-Green as the first woman of color to lead the franchise and uncharted territory to explore, the iconic franchise is boldly going in a direction we can't wait to experience for ourselves. \n2. The Defenders (Aug. 18, Netflix)\n\nMarvel and Netflix's collaboration has given us three epic series -- and Iron Fist -- over the past three years, and The Defenders will finally bring all four heroes together for a team-up that may not have the special effects budget of an Avengers movie, but will undoubtedly feature just as much snark and ass-kicking. \nOkay, so we're really hoping that the show will be 90 percent Jessica and Luke relentlessly mocking Danny (and 10 percent them making out), but whatever your feelings on each of the four shows, it's thrilling to imagine Marvel's four \"street-level\" crime fighters joining forces, if only to see what kind of hallway brawl the stunt team comes up with. Defenders, assemble! \n3. The Tick (Aug. 25, Amazon Video)\nBehold good world, @serafinowicz is finally suited up for the first week on set. #TheTick pic.twitter.com/bjDlpWcULN— The Tick (@TheTickTV) March 10, 2017\n\nBen Edlund is bringing back his big blue bug for a new live-action comedy, courtesy of Amazon. Since the spooftastic superhero was originally designed as a parody of other comic book characters, Edlund and his team should have plenty of material to work with in the reboot, which stars a pitch-perfect Peter Serafinowicz in the titular, spoon-loving role. \n4. Future Man (Fall, Hulu)\n\nHunger Games star Josh Hutcherson heads to the small screen for this high-concept sci-fi comedy from executive producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Hutcherson stars as Josh Futterman, a janitor by day/world-ranked gamer by night who is tasked with preventing the extinction of humanity after mysterious visitors from the future proclaim him the key to defeating an imminent super-race invasion. The show also features Glenne Headly's last role -- the Dick Tracy actress died unexpectedly during production on the series, in which she played the mother of Hutcherson's character. \n5. The Deuce (Sept. 10, HBO)\n\nThe Wire creator David Simon is returning to HBO for a lavish new period drama set in 1970s New York, exploring the rise of the porn industry and the many players within it. James Franco pulls double duty as twin brothers Vincent and Frankie Martino, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal as entrepreneurial sex worker Candy. Seedy and seductive in equal measure, it looks like just the right blend of character drama and cultural specificity we've come to expect from Simon's work.\nWATCH: ‘Star Trek’ was filmed in a brewery, and other little-knowns"},"shares":{"facebook":144,"twitter":540,"google_plus":9,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":2,"total":699},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/laRsNvUveehR3adPUnEpVyEH2ns=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525130%2F88a90ced-c2e6-4c2d-a78f-a39bffb4e9ee.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/t40PcQ8Oxc6AE6K37Pu3ZDxYrMY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gHnmaNeWPOzIzsXB3-hrL1TSONs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YL5nQHBqSYm04pJJl_LSVA2cUiY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lBwwvBvw59D-daQi4vg5PkgLosY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZcIPvNltZaUBJV5FdXYH-TQCd5w=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50379%2Fd77405a6-ed55-4435-bce1-5697b42e21c9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tcLIlE","display_title":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"z63nwNQ05E","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Mark your calendars!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"5 new shows we can't wait to see in 2017"},{"_id":"59555ed7f11b2c7769000153","id":"2017/06/29/sense8-netflix-canceled-special-finale","title":"'Sense8' will return for a two-hour special on Netflix because sometimes things work out","title_tag":null,"author":"Sasha Lekach","post_date":"2017-06-29T20:11:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 20:11:02 +0000","formatted_date":"06/29/2017","formatted_shares":"873","sort_key":"1DqHOl","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/29/sense8-netflix-canceled-special-finale/","content":{"plain":"It looks like the hashtags and petitions to bring back the canceled Netflix series Sense8 are working.

It’s our eight best picks for you, along with a bonus choice that, while not strictly one of the greats, deserves a guilty pleasure mention. Enjoy.\n1. The Handmaid's Tale\n\nThe best show of the year so far is also the hardest to watch, but don't you dare look away. While seeing women being stripped of their rights sadly isn't a far-fetched concept right now, no other series has captured the zeitgeist in such an effective way -- its impact can be seen all around us, from public protests across the country to a mansplaining Saturday Night Live parody. Confrontational, horrifying and beautiful in equal measure, Hulu's Handmaid's Tale is both a timely parable and an electrifying call to action against the evil that is allowed to flourish when good people do nothing. What could be more vital?\n2. The Good Fight\n\nOn paper, CBS All Access' first scripted series may not be as flashy as the upcoming Star Trek: Discovery, but The Good Fight is a worthy successor to The Good Wife, and that's a damn high bar to clear. It's every bit as fearless as its predecessor when it comes to interrogating thorny themes like racism, sexism and ageism in corporate America, and showrunners Robert and Michelle King are still among the best writers in the medium for distilling some of the country's most challenging ideological issues -- from police brutality to cyber-bullying -- into deeply personal stories. The only downside? The show's agonizingly short 10-episode order, compared with its forebear's 22-episode seasons. We're counting the days until Season 2. \n3. Big Little Lies\n\nExecutive produced by Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, who also starred alongside Shailene Woodley, Laura Dern and Zoe Kravitz, this supposedly closed-ended HBO miniseries already has fans clamouring for a second season -- and they just might get one. \nThe show is noteworthy for giving us one of the most unflinching representations of domestic violence ever seen on TV without ever being gratuitous or preachy, but it's the relationships between the fully-realized women at its core that kept viewers coming back for more. A lot of the credit for the beauty of the show and its gracefully unfurling mystery is owed to director Jean-Marc Vallée and writer David E. Kelley -- we just wish the decidedly female-driven narrative had featured female writers or directors too.\n4. Dear White People\n\nJustin Simien's Netflix adaptation of his own movie may have completed production before last November's election, but no show has a better response to the myth of \"post-racial America\" than this comedic gem. Brutally honest and blazingly funny, Dear White People might be hard to swallow for some sensitive snowflakes, but we need more shows with this level of self-awareness, humor and heart. \n5. Glow\n\nEven though it was only released on June 23, this ode to '80s women's wrestling is already one of the year's most entertaining new entries -- a breezy binge that nonetheless packs a powerful punch thanks to its roster of painfully relatable female leads.  Co-created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, with Orange is the New Black creator Jenji Kohan on board as an executive producer, Glow has all the charm and quirkiness of OITNB, and -- with a svelte 30-minute run time and 10 episode order -- none of its bloat. \n6. Shots Fired\n\nThe only show from a broadcast network to make the list, this Fox limited series tackled the issue of  police brutality from both sides of the thin blue line with enviable nuance and grace. Created by Gina Prince-Bythewood and Reggie Rock Bythewood and anchored by powerhouse performances from Sanaa Lathan and Stephan James, this vital murder mystery wasn't afraid to ask the tough questions, or provide even tougher answers.\n7. American Gods\n\nShowrunners Bryan Fuller and Michael Green set themselves an almost impossible task in trying to adapt Neil Gaiman's beloved novel, but the weird, wild freshman season of their Starz drama proved that they were more than up to the challenge. Every bit as artful as Fuller's Hannibal, with all the compelling character drama of Green's Logan script, this trippy road trip hooked us from the start, and we still have many miles to go before we sleep, thank the gods. \n8. 13 Reasons Why\n\nUnderstandably divisive but undeniably compelling, Netflix's uncompromising teen drama hit close to home for many viewers, sparking a vital conversation about mental health, bullying and suicide that the TV industry usually shies away from. While mental health professionals criticized its graphic depiction of self-harm, the show undoubtedly touches on themes that are all-too relatable for many teens (and plenty of adults) -- and uses a refreshingly diverse and intersectional cast to deliver them. Whether you thought it was too much or just enough, its cultural impact can't be overstated.\n8.5 Riverdale\n\nThe CW's soapy teen drama owes a lot to Twin Peaks, but while the Showtime revival is drowning in self-indulgence, this deliciously twisted take on Archie, Betty and Veronica offers a tightly-plotted murder mystery while still making time for high school hijinx and Dynasty-esque family feuding. Riverdale might not be an Emmy contender, but in the era of Peak TV, when we have a dozen identical shows jostling for prestige drama status, it's refreshing to find a series that knows exactly what it is and consistently delivers that addictive blend of camp, noir and sass with its pussycat ears firmly in place. \nWATCH: '13 Reasons Why' hid a finale clue in the music"},"shares":{"facebook":768,"google_plus":6,"twitter":262,"linked_in":19,"pinterest":2,"total":1057},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cuwMfygg6X4Aws0gq3Dxb317FhY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F520204%2Ff599070a-6e1d-426b-bf89-ed7cf8d114c9.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Nq93F98kl3jKqCwiZrcm-uCuWVA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49507%2Fe83e679d-2018-403f-8a6f-01df62e46802.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Lkhbz-wvFd3WNqfNhURlBxlFQng=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49507%2Fe83e679d-2018-403f-8a6f-01df62e46802.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ri7DWtRGXyqGOjru-9r61cQsqmE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49507%2Fe83e679d-2018-403f-8a6f-01df62e46802.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JxjX3VEMEmSp58NtC67Z9yeLr-g=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49507%2Fe83e679d-2018-403f-8a6f-01df62e46802.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0w3cGuhKfAV8nDIGsjhuQR2rPpM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49507%2Fe83e679d-2018-403f-8a6f-01df62e46802.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tiuowA","display_title":"The best new TV shows of 2017 (so far)","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xgldrVz076","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Add these shows to your binge list, stat.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"These are the best new shows of 2017, so start bingeing"},{"_id":"594c8ebd28cc3605390001b4","id":"2017/06/22/to-the-bone-trailer-netflix","title":"Netflix's new film is already getting '13 Reasons Why' criticism — and it's not even out yet","title_tag":null,"author":"Rebecca Ruiz","post_date":"2017-06-23T03:44:59+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 03:44:59 +0000","formatted_date":"06/23/2017","formatted_shares":"527","sort_key":"1Dorzb","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/22/to-the-bone-trailer-netflix/","content":{"plain":"To the Bone doesn't premiere on Netflix until July 14, but the streaming platform is already facing sharp online criticism from people who say the trailer's portrayal of a young woman's eating disorder is triggering and potentially harmful. \nOne look at the Twitter hashtag #TotheBone and it's easy to see why those who've had eating disorders are worried about how the film portrays a complex condition like anorexia, which often isn't accurately or responsibly depicted in the media. \nSEE ALSO: Netflix rolls out new way to get you to watch more Netflix\nThe two-minute trailer focuses on Ellen, played by actress Lily Collins, who counts calories and becomes increasingly frail until a presumably triumphant turnaround. Ellen's extreme thinness is the subject of much of the criticism, as are fears that the movie romanticizes what can be a fatal disorder. The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) recommends against showing \"dangerous thinness\" because of the way that imagery can affect people experiencing or recovering from an eating disorder. \n\"The images, for someone who is at risk or struggling, it can be a very visceral experience.\n\"The images, for someone who is at risk or struggling, it can be a very visceral experience, it can trigger all kinds of upsetting feelings,\" says Claire Mysko, CEO of NEDA. Some viewers, she says, may see it as a \"race to the bottom\" to lose even more weight. \nThe trailer has been viewed more than 1 million times since debuting Tuesday.\nMarti Noxon, the film's writer and director, responded to the criticism on Twitter soon after the trailer dropped. \"We hope the film helps people talk about a subject that is too often ignored,\" she wrote.\nShe followed up with a more comprehensive statement Thursday night that acknowledged her own experiences with anorexia and bulimia and stressed the importance of responsibly portraying what it's like to have an eating disorder. \n\"My goal with the film was not to glamorize EDs, but to serve as a conversation starter about an issue that is too often shrouded by secrecy and misconceptions,\" she wrote. \n#ToTheBone @netflix pic.twitter.com/ULlsJco3oV— marti noxon (@martinoxon) June 23, 2017\n\nThe initial fallout over the trailer probably feels like familiar territory for Netflix. When the streaming platform released the fictional young adult series 13 Reasons Why in March, mental health experts and suicide survivors argued that the show's graphic portrayal of suicide might negatively influence young, impressionable viewers. Researchers have shown that news reports and dramatizations of suicide may be linked to a temporary spike in suicides.\nAside from the complicated subject matter, To the Bone shares another similarity with 13 Reasons Why: Both projects were made with the hope that they'd tell an important story by tackling a common but highly stigmatized experience. Noxon based the film on her own experiences and Collins has talked about previously battling an eating disorder as well. \nI appreciate the concern but no one made me do this film. I wanted, needed to. I'm so proud of what we accomplished. Time we talk about it!— Lily Collins (@lilycollins) June 21, 2017\n\n“I was writing to try to help people who don’t understand, who can’t relate to why someone would starve, or throw up, or just spend their life obsessed with food, or obsessed with their body size,” Noxon told Indiewire earlier this year.\nThirty million Americans experience an eating disorder at some point in their lives, according to NEDA. In order to help raise awareness, To the Bone partnered with Project Heal, an organization that raises money to help people get access to treatment. In her statement issued Thursday, Noxon described how she spoke with survivors to inform the film and worked with Project Heal throughout the production \"in the hopes of being truthful in a way that wasn't exploitative.\" \n\"There are a lot of people who struggle in higher-weight bodies, people of all ages, races and genders whose stories don’t get told.\" \nWhile Mysko wishes the trailer had fewer scenes portraying extreme thinness, she is hopeful that the film will share an important story about illness and recovery without glorifying eating disorders or erasing the diversity of people's experiences. Collins' character is cast as a thin, white, middle-class woman. \n\"There are a lot of people who struggle in higher-weight bodies, people of all ages, races and genders whose stories don’t get told,\" says Mysko. \nWhile the public commonly associates extreme thinness with anorexia, not everyone with the disorder has that body type. Hollywood, however, often defaults to the stereotype even as other aspects of a person's life, including their work, relationships, and education, are deeply affected by anorexia and offer alternative ways to show the condition's impact. \nAndrea LaMarre&#x200f, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Family Relations and Applied Nutrition at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, who has spoken about her own eating disorder, says that the passionate reaction to the trailer reflects a larger frustration with how these stories are told and whose experiences they feature. \n\"It's representative of an ongoing tension in the field, and this [trailer] has crystallized it,\" she says. \nI'm not going to lie, I'm pretty tired of how media, research, and treatment for #EatingDisorders fixate on anorexia— Andrea LaMarre (@andrealala89) June 21, 2017\n\nCritics of the trailer also pointed out that it offered no mental health resources for those who might need support after seeing the images pop up in their newsfeed. Mysko is hopeful that Netflix, which received the same criticism over graphic episodes of 13 Reasons Why, will air the film with the contact information for appropriate helplines. \nShe is cautiously optimistic given that, prior to the film's Netflix distribution deal, NEDA partnered with its actors to produce a public service announcement addressing common myths about eating disorders. \n\n\"I do believe that there is a commitment to not only raising awareness but connecting people to resources,\" she says. \nThe trailer controversy, in tandem with the 13 Reasons Why criticism, holds important lessons for Netflix. While the streaming giant continues to take risks on programming that tackles highly stigmatized issues, it still hasn't quite learned how to respond to the outpouring of feedback from tight-knit communities of patients, survivors, and advocates who have strong feelings about the experiences its shows and films portray. It also hasn't figured out how to anticipate viewers' needs for things like trigger warnings and crisis information at every step of the way. \nUntil it begins to master those aspects of producing and distributing entertainment meant to confront shame and stigma, it'll continue to discover its blind spots by trial and error.\nIf you want to talk to someone about your experience with disordered eating, text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741. Organizations like the National Eating Disorder Association (U.S.),National Eating Disorder Information Centre (Canada), The Butterfly Foundation (Australia), the National Centre for Eating Disorders (UK) and We Bite Back can also offer support.\nWATCH: This robotic spoon is changing the lives of people with limited mobility"},"shares":{"facebook":238,"twitter":280,"linked_in":3,"google_plus":5,"pinterest":1,"total":527},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RdVNAXzBCSyjKHHOExJogH42Nx4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F516426%2Fe2fda736-d80b-448b-a00e-729f1098eb27.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gdTQG1Xuv6eUbnjWGT_OSxrvyeU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49538%2F6dfb9da2-6384-4f8b-8549-fbeeac92082a.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DYjlKllVIxn4kpkqlX6vysDYGYw=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49538%2F6dfb9da2-6384-4f8b-8549-fbeeac92082a.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yBO_WRbjNe13LzeuUhKk4ZyOFu8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49538%2F6dfb9da2-6384-4f8b-8549-fbeeac92082a.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NVM4W0kqbEwW_7IMmNzNjyteQSM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49538%2F6dfb9da2-6384-4f8b-8549-fbeeac92082a.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CoO3N_2apZ0xe-ZDp5C7O1Jmu5A=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49538%2F6dfb9da2-6384-4f8b-8549-fbeeac92082a.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tUDJqz","display_title":"Netflix's new film is already getting '13 Reasons Why' criticism — and it's not even out yet","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"WwozRNroN4","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Survivors and experts are worried about the portrayal of eating disorders in \"To the Bone.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Social Good","channel_label":"Social Good","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/social-good/","tweet_text":"Netflix's new film is already getting '13 Reasons Why' criticism — and it's not even out yet"},{"_id":"594ab6e1f11b2c2ac30006df","id":"2017/06/21/star-wars-rogue-one-netflix","title":"Netflix finally gets its first live-action 'Star Wars' film","title_tag":null,"author":"Marcus Gilmer","post_date":"2017-06-21T18:11:44+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 18:11:44 +0000","formatted_date":"06/21/2017","formatted_shares":"3.3k","sort_key":"1DnKXf","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/21/star-wars-rogue-one-netflix/","content":{"plain":"Finally, there is peace in the streaming galaxy as a roving band of rebels have made it to their destination just as the prophecy foretold. In English? Rogue One is coming to Netflix.\nThe news it's notable as Rogue One is officially the first non-animated Star Wars film to come to Netflix. It's hitting the service in July, The Verge reports. \nIt's part of deal that old deal Disney and Netflix signed that would bring a slew of Disney stuff -- including Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar properties -- to the streaming service. That means you'll see those films on Netflix before Hulu or Amazon and before pay-TV networks like HBO, though the film has already been available for rent and purchase on iTunes.\nSEE ALSO: These are the 11 most important Star Wars scenes ever. Fight me.\nWhy Rogue One and not another Star Wars film? The Netflix agreement applies to Disney films released in 2016 onward; The Force Awakens was released in the final days of 2015 and thus, at least for U.S. audiences, fell under Disney's previous deal with Starz. \nAnd the \"2016 and onward\" part of the deal excludes the first six Star Wars saga films, though it's worth noting Disney only owns five of the six films -- 21st Century Fox still owns A New Hope. \n\nThere has been one Star Wars film streaming on Netflix: the animated 2008 Clone Wars movie which saw a theatrical release in 2008 and launched the animated Clone Wars television series. Besides its release date, the fact that the film was produced by Warner Brothers also separates it from the Disney deal.  \nStill, Rogue One is a big get for Netflix which should give it a nice boost in the ongoing streaming wars.\nNow, if only someone will start streaming Ewoks: The Battle For Endor.\nWATCH: Homemade ‘Star Wars’ affordably reenacts the Battle of Hoth"},"shares":{"facebook":995,"twitter":284,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":2032,"pinterest":1,"total":3319},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/z98iNsuwUqQzsMhhm1aFPNjkbgs=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F515057%2Fb0994ac4-faa0-436b-a30f-24df70c3403f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ux0mzHgXoa8A-7uc7dLXwuhO8yQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49379%2Ff76fb4dc-1abd-48cf-9207-806ea3e7da47.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/brs3Hp0b0NClLvKEGoP-rLQGnAI=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49379%2Ff76fb4dc-1abd-48cf-9207-806ea3e7da47.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pdqAZV7Sy02Jl0RC-AX1uxpK2UE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49379%2Ff76fb4dc-1abd-48cf-9207-806ea3e7da47.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/loXH1eDkxTidMm6w2s0v0LEoL70=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49379%2Ff76fb4dc-1abd-48cf-9207-806ea3e7da47.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8XWHkvPBDEY-1qKxaysj8xHLFUA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49379%2Ff76fb4dc-1abd-48cf-9207-806ea3e7da47.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ttTNAt","display_title":"Netflix finally gets its first live-action 'Star Wars' film","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG2a80Nv","data-source":"blueprint"},{"data-slug":"OEGoA4Nl16","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The first of many.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Netflix finally gets its first live-action 'Star Wars' film"},{"_id":"59491cf9f11b2c17b60009b8","id":"2017/06/20/netflix-interactive-tv","title":"Netflix introduces interactive TV where you can pick the outcome","title_tag":null,"author":"Proma Khosla","post_date":"2017-06-20T13:02:47+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 13:02:47 +0000","formatted_date":"06/20/2017","formatted_shares":"572","sort_key":"1Dnjfp","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/20/netflix-interactive-tv/","content":{"plain":"Trust Netflix to be the platform that introduces choose-your-own-adventure TV.
