<p>Chatting on the mobile devices seems to be pretty fun but users can also opt to use the WhatsApp Application on their PCs. Yes, friends! Users can also use the app on their PCs to enhance their chatting experience. Also, users can send images and files that are stored on the PC storage, which is quite large compared to mobile device storages.<img class="wp-image-65 alignright" src="https://whatsuply.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/download-whatsapp-for-pc-windows.png?x51602" alt="Download WhatsApp for PC Windows" width="570" height="432" srcset="https://whatsuply.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/download-whatsapp-for-pc-windows.png 650w, https://whatsuply.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/download-whatsapp-for-pc-windows-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px" /></p>

<li>2GB RAM of the processor.</li>
<li>About 100MB free space to avoid system lags.</li>

<p>One more important thing needed for running WhatsApp on the PC is an Android Emulator. To run any Android based application on the PC we require an Android Emulator in the PC. This is a Software application that runs Android APK files and installs the apps on the PCs.</p>
<p>There are various Android emulators in the market these days. If you already have one, then good for you but if you do not have one, then follow the link given below to download the Bluestacks App for your PC.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Download Bluestacks for PC</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Allow the download to complete as it may take some time. Install the Bluestacks application and launch it on your PC. You will have to link your Google Account in the Bluestacks application just like the Google Play Store requirements to continue using the application. Now we will proceed with the WhatsApp Download process:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Download the WhatsApp APK file for Android devices from the links given in the above respective section.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Locate the APK file on your PC and open it with Bluestacks App.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">The file will run its setup and the App will install on the Bluestacks app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you will be able to see the app&#8217;s icon on your PC through the Bluestacks app. It means that whenever you wish to launch the App on your PC you must use the Bluestacks application to do this. This is the easiest way to the Whatsapp Download and installation process complete on your PC devices.</div></div><div class="su-note" style="border-color:#9ed3bd;border-radius:6px;-moz-border-radius:6px;-webkit-border-radius:6px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-clearfix" style="background-color:#b0ebd2;border-color:#effbf6;color:#000000;border-radius:6px;-moz-border-radius:6px;-webkit-border-radius:6px;">
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span id="Download_WhatsApp_for_Mac_OS">Download WhatsApp for Mac OS</span></h2>
<p>WhatsApp is undoubtedly the most wanted and used application, as it handles around 64bilion messages in a day. This is tough for any app-based system to navigate. Just as we can use the App on the PCs, similarly we can use it on the Mac device too. WhatsApp is also applicable and compatible with the Mac OS. The WhatsApp iOS App is available for Mac OS download for free through the web.</p>
<p>Before we jump to the method(s) for <a href="https://whatsuply.com/whatsapp-for-pc-download-mac-windows-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp Download on the Mac OS devices</a>, we have to look at some of its system requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X 10.9 and higher versions</li>
<li>64-bit processor</li>
<li>WhatsApp dmg file for installation.</li>
<li>*Android emulator</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-74" src="https://whatsuply.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/whatsapp-for-mac-download.png?x51602" alt="WhatsApp for Mac Download" width="500" height="325" srcset="https://whatsuply.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/whatsapp-for-mac-download.png 500w, https://whatsuply.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/whatsapp-for-mac-download-300x195.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />To get the app on Mac devices, we have two methods in line for our readers. You can try either of them to successfully download and install the WhatsApp on your Mac device. There is one way, of using the older Bluestacks version or different emulators for the process, or another way is to use the official dmg file released by the WhatsApp for Mac OS devices.</p>
<p>We will discuss both the methods here in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Using Emulator:</strong></span>
<ul>
<li>Bluestacks Emulator is also available for the Mac OS but sometimes it fails to support the WhatsApp Application file to install. Although you can still use the older version of Bluestacks application to run the WhatsApp application on your Mac. Click on the file given here to download the Bluestacks beta version for Mac OS: <a href="http://cdn.bluestacks.com/public/mac-beta/BlueStacks_AppPlayer-Beta.dmg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Download Bluestacks Beta version for Mac OS</a></li>
<li>After downloading this file drag the file to the Applications folder and let the Mac OS system install it like any other apps.</li>
<li>Create your account and then search for WhatsApp on the Bluestacks search bar.</li>
<li>Allow download of the file and install it through the Bluestacks application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This way you will be able to get the WhatsApp Download App on your Mac device. As we said, Bluestacks is no longer responding well to the Mac OS system and hence you may have to find an alternative Android emulator for Mac OS or you can use this official method to get the app on your Mac OS device.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WhatsApp Download through Official dmg file release:</strong></span> To get this method right do the following:
<ul>
<li>Click on the link given here to visit the official Download page: <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">WhatsApp for Mac(official)</a></li>
<li>Next, under the download for PC option, you will see the option for &#8220;Mac OS&#8221; devices.</li>
<li>Click on the option &#8220;<strong>Download for Mac OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>&#8221; and the download will initiate.</li>
<li>After the download is complete, unzip the file and allow its setup to run.</li>
<li>To install it on your Mac OS select the option and drag the dmg file icon of WhatsApp to the Application folder and allow the installation to begin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the app will be ready for use on your Mac through its official website. Hence, you have seen a couple of ways to get the WhatsApp Download for Mac OS devices. Try these out and hopefully one of them will definitely work for your Mac OS.</div></div><div class="su-note" style="border-color:#e5e5e5;border-radius:6px;-moz-border-radius:6px;-webkit-border-radius:6px;"><div class="su-note-inner su-clearfix" style="background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#ffffff;color:#000000;border-radius:6px;-moz-border-radius:6px;-webkit-border-radius:6px;">
