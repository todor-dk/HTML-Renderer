          <p class="question">How do I register and receive donations for my charitable organization?</p>
          <p class="answer">Registering your organization is easy. In order to register and receive donations, you must be an official representative of an eligible organization, and then follow these easy steps:<ol>
              <li>Search for your charitable organization by name or EIN number and then select the organization you represent. Be sure to confirm you are selecting the correct organization, as many charitable organizations have similar names. </li>
              <li>Create an organization administrator account and accept the AmazonSmile Participation Agreement on behalf of your organization. </li>
              <li>Verify your email address (we recommend that you use an email address that is associated with your charitable organization).</li>
              <li>Submit your organization’s bank account information.</li>
              <li>Upload a copy of a voided check or bank statement to verify your organization’s bank account information.</li>
              <p></p></ol>
          </p>
          <p class="question">What is an organization administrator?</p>
          <p class="answer">An organization administrator is an official representative of an organization that has authority to access and manage AmazonSmile program information on behalf of their charitable organization. </p>
          <p class="question">Why do you need an email address for my charitable organization?</p>
          <p class="answer">We require a valid email address so that we can communicate important program information to each registered organization. From time to time we will send emails with information about your organization’s donation amounts and information about AmazonSmile program promotions.</p>
          <p class="question">Can you mail our organization a donation check instead of sending an electronic funds transfer?</p>
          <p class="answer">We do not mail donation checks due to the expense of check processing and fulfillment. We distribute donations using electronic transfer to reduce operational expenses so we can donate 100% of the funds to eligible charitable organizations.</p>
          <p class="question">Will customers still be able to select my charitable organization if I don’t register?</p>
          <p class="answer">Yes. As long as your organization is listed by <a href="http://www.guidestar.org">GuideStar</a> and meets our eligibility criteria, customers will be able to select your organization. However, no donations will be made to your organization until you complete your free registration. See "What happens if we do not register ..." under Receive Donations for more information on how donations are processed for organizations that do not register and provide bank account information.</p>
          <p class="question">What happens if another person has already registered my charitable organization and they were not authorized to do so?</p>
          <p class="answer">If your organization has been registered by an unauthorized person please <a href="/contact-us/ref=org_sls_ulp_cucc_cuf">contact us</a>.</p>

        <div id="aboutAmazonSmile" style="display:none;">
          <h2>About AmazonSmile</h2>
          <p class="question">What is AmazonSmile?</p>
          <p class="answer">AmazonSmile is a website operated by Amazon that lets customers enjoy the same wide selection of products, low prices, and convenient shopping features as on Amazon.com. The difference is that when customers shop on AmazonSmile (<a href="http://smile.amazon.com/ref=org_sls_ulp_sas_sml">smile.amazon.com</a>), the AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the price of eligible purchases to the charitable organizations selected by customers. </p>
          <p class="question">What are the eligibility requirements for charitable organizations to participate?</p>
          <p class="answer">Organizations must be registered and in good standing with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) to be eligible to participate.  Organizations must be public charitable organizations (not private foundations) and may not be supporting organizations, unless identified specifically as a Type I, Type II, or functionally integrated Type III supporting organization.   Eligible charitable organizations must also be located in one of the 50 U.S. states or the District of Columbia. Organizations that engage in, support, encourage, or promote intolerance, hate, terrorism, violence, money laundering, or other illegal activities are not eligible to participate. Amazon relies on the US Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Southern Poverty Law Center to determine which registered charities fall into these groups. Charitable organizations must also adhere to the  <a href="/agreement/ref=org_sls_ulp_cpa">AmazonSmile Participation Agreement</a> to maintain eligibility. Charitable organizations may choose not to participate in AmazonSmile at any time. Although we aim to include only charitable organizations that are in good standing and do not engage in any of the activities described above, we cannot guarantee the good standing and/or conduct of any charitable organization. For complete details, see the  <a href="/agreement/ref=org_sls_ulp_cpa">AmazonSmile Participation Agreement</a>.</p>
          <p class="question">How does AmazonSmile work?</p>
          <p class="answer">When first visiting AmazonSmile, customers are prompted to select a charitable organization from almost one million eligible organizations. In order to browse or shop at AmazonSmile, customers must first select a charitable organization. For eligible purchases at AmazonSmile, the AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the purchase price to the customer’s selected charitable organization.</p>
          <p class="question">Is there any cost to charitable organizations or to customers?</p>
          <p class="answer">No. There is no cost to charitable organizations or to AmazonSmile customers. The shopping experience is identical to Amazon.com with the added benefit that the AmazonSmile Foundation will donate to the charitable organizations selected by customers.</p>
          <p class="question">Do you charge any administrative fees or take any deduction from the donation amount?</p>
          <p class="answer">No. Charities must register to receive donations and have a valid bank account to which we can route donations, but there is no charge to participate and we do not deduct any fees from the donation amount.</p>
          <p class="question">Can charitable organizations outside the U.S. participate?</p>
          <p class="answer">No. Eligible charitable organizations must be qualified under Section 501(c)(3) and located in one of the 50 U.S. States or the District of Columbia.</p>
          <p class="question">What are spotlight charities?</p>
          <p class="answer">From time to time we may highlight one or more charitable organizations from the total list of eligible organizations. We do this to make it easier for customers to choose an organization to support from the almost one million available, but we do not endorse any particular organization or the causes they support. To apply for consideration as a spotlight charity, please submit a spotlight charity application. Note that you must first register your charitable organization at org.amazon.com. Sign in to org.amazon.com, then click the Help link at the top of the page, then under General Program Information, select the Spotlight Charities link to access the application form. </p>
          <p class="question">What is the AmazonSmile Foundation?</p>
          <p class="answer">The AmazonSmile Foundation is a 501(c)(3) private foundation created by Amazon to administer the AmazonSmile program. All donation amounts generated by the AmazonSmile program are remitted to the AmazonSmile Foundation. In turn, the AmazonSmile Foundation donates those amounts to the charitable organizations selected by our customers. Amazon pays all expenses of the AmazonSmile Foundation; they are not deducted from the donation amounts generated by purchases on AmazonSmile.</p>
          <p class="question">May customers make direct donations to charitable organizations through the AmazonSmile program?</p>
          <p class="answer">Not at this time. The only way for customers to support their selected charitable organization is by shopping at smile.amazon.com.</p>
          <p class="question">Does the AmazonSmile Foundation take any portion of donations to fund its operations?</p>
          <p class="answer">No. Amazon funds the operations of the AmazonSmile Foundation.</p>
          <p class="question">How do I contact AmazonSmile?</p>
          <p class="answer">To submit a question to the org.amazon.com support team, use this <a href="/contact-us/ref=org_sls_ulp_cu_cuf">contact us</a> form.</p>
          <p class="question">If I do not want my organization to participate in the AmazonSmile program, what do I do?</p>

          <p class="question">Where did you get my organization's information?</p>

          <p class="answer">Sign in to Org Central and select Settings at the top of the page.  Click on the "Remove me as administrator" button. Then, a new administrator will need to register the organization and resubmit bank account information at org.amazon.com.  <br><br>If your administrator is no longer with the company or you believe your account was claimed by someone outside your organization, please <a href="/contact-us/ref=org_sls_ulp_cu_cuf" id="as-contact-us">contact us</a> and include a request in your message to remove the current administrator.

        <div id="receiveDonations" style="display:none;">
          <h2>Receive Donations</h2>
          <p class="question">How does my charity receive the donations?</p>
          <p class="answer">Each quarter, the AmazonSmile Foundation makes donations to eligible charitable organizations by electronic funds transfer. Donations will be transferred approximately 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter. To account for product returns, a portion of the quarterly donations will be withheld until the next donation cycle, subject to any reduction due to returns from prior quarters. See the <a href="/agreement/ref=org_sls_ulp_cpa">AmazonSmile Participation Agreement</a>
 for more details.</p>
          <p class="question">What happens if we do not register our charitable organization and provide a bank account for an electronic transfer?</p>
          <p class="answer">If you have not registered and have donations allocated to your organization, we will attempt to contact you with instructions on how to register. If you do not register your charitable organization, including providing accurate bank account information for an electronic transfer, the AmazonSmile Foundation will still track and store donations earned in each calendar quarter. Once you’ve registered your charitable organization, your organization will be eligible to receive in the next donation cycle all donation amounts that were previously allocated to your organization and were not subject to reallocation under the Participation Agreement. Please note that donations that have been allocated to an unregistered charitable organization from customers that made their first supporting purchase more than eight full quarters ago and have not been distributed will be reallocated to other registered charitable organizations.</p>
          <p class="question">How much of the customers’ purchase price does Amazon donate?</p>
          <p class="answer">The AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the purchase price from customers’ eligible AmazonSmile purchases to the charitable organizations they select. The purchase price for each item is the sale price, excluding shipping, handling, and gift-wrapping fees, taxes, and service charges, and less any rebates, returns, and bad debt. Certain items are not eligible for and will not result in donations.</p>
          <p class="question">What purchases are eligible for donations?</p>
          <p class="answer">Tens of millions of products on AmazonSmile are eligible for donations. You will see eligible products marked “Eligible for AmazonSmile donation” on their product detail pages. Recurring Subscribe-and-Save purchases and subscription renewals are not currently eligible. For more information, see Qualifying Purchases in the <a href="/agreement/ref=org_sls_ulp_cpa">AmazonSmile Participation Agreement</a>.</p>

          <p class="question">In order to receive a donation disbursement, what is the minimum amount my organization needs to have accrued from customer purchases?</p>
          <p class="answer">The minimum amount a charitable organization must accrue to receive a quarterly donation is $5.00. If the total donation amount due to your organization, based on the purchases by all customers who selected your charitable organization, is less than $5.00 as of the end of a given calendar quarter, the AmazonSmile Foundation will hold the donation amounts and add them to donation amounts allocated to your organization in subsequent calendar quarters. However, if you have an accrued donation that remains below $5.00 for four consecutive quarters, the AmazonSmile Foundation will disburse accrued donation amounts to you in the donation cycle following the fourth quarter, even if the donation amount is less than $5.00. For complete details, see the <a href="/agreement/ref=org_sls_ulp_cpa">AmazonSmile Participation Agreement</a>.</p>
          <p class="question">Can I view the amount of donations my charitable organization has received?</p>
          <p class="answer">We currently do not provide reports that enable viewing of donations received.</p>
          <p class="question">I registered but didn't receive a donation. What happened?</p>
          <p class="answer">If you registered, but did not receive a donation disbursement, please ensure that you have added the correct bank account information for your organization to your Org Central account. Also, you will not receive a donation disbursement if your  organization’s earnings are below the minimum donation amount of $5.00. Note that donations accrued during each calendar quarter are disbursed approximately 45 days after the end of that calendar quarter. Even if your organization does not accrue at least $5.00 in donations, the AmazonSmile Foundation will make a donation at least once per year.
