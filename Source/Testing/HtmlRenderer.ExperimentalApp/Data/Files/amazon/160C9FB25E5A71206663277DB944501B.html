Customers simply arrange their shipment ahead of time, visit the store, and access their order via a barcode scanner on the side of the machine. Each package is preloaded by workers.\nSEE ALSO: Walmart tests a giant self-serve kiosk that dispenses groceries\nThe massive orange towers stand 16 feet tall by 8 feet wide and deliver items through a conveyor belt inside the contraption. Walmart began testing the system last fall in an Arkansas store near its headquarters.\n\nThe device isn't the only giant vending machine being implemented as the retailer looks for ways to compete with Amazon's hyper-efficient service. Earlier this year, Walmart unveiled a similar, much larger storage unit for grocery orders.\nWalmart is banking on its thousands of stores and army of store employees to serve as a key advantage in its ongoing war with the online shopping juggernaut. Other experiments that cater to these strengths include a program in which store workers deliver packages on the way home from work and a partnership with Uber for short-distance delivery orders.\nAmazon's pending blockbuster deal to acquire Whole Foods will only up the ante as the company leverages its own major network of brick-and-mortar stores for the first time.\nWATCH: Amazon has so many orders that it needs its own cargo plane\n  "},"shares":{"twitter":187,"facebook":361,"linked_in":1881,"google_plus":9,"pinterest":2,"total":2440},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TEUxzZhS3tOVmaG8y_km0Y1vg2A=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XzPlduuDNHXww_lY4PSR70XKj6g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uQp4hPb5blIFYBQB4Shr_nGa5yc=/800x360/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":true,"size":"800x360#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2Ue2gLS8UrdDmQycJ81bKqAvuLo=/1600x720/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1600x720#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tRmXfw","display_title":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"W3bokPB07M","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Walmart is doubling down on the human-free experience.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders"}

If it's in a 12.5-ounce plastic container with the number P-8827 inside the USDA's inspection mark, you might be in trouble.\nIt's a cause for concern as tuna is a known food allergen. According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, symptoms of fish allergy could include hives, nausea, indigestion, stuffy noses, and in the worst case, anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction that impedes breathing and needs immediate medical attention.\nIn a statement to Mashable, Willow Tree confirmed that the error was first discovered by a Whole foods employee who realized the ready-made containers actually contained cranberry apple tuna salad.\nMashable also reached out to Whole Foods for comment, and will update the story when the company replies. \nThe USDA said there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions yet. \nUnfortunate shoppers who ended up with the product have been asked to toss it out or return it to their local store. \nToo bad we can't return the salad with free Amazon drone delivery yet.

If it were true, Google's market cap would fall from $623 billion to about $83 billion, while Microsoft's market cap would be propelled to nearly $1 trillion. \nSEE ALSO: New York Times is using Google’s AI to expand online comments\nThe odd occurrence was caused by a data glitch, the Financial Times reported late Monday, that affected only some of the stocks listed on Nasdaq. While the stock prices remained unaltered on Nasdaq itself, third-party services such as Google Finance and Bloomberg displayed the erroneous $123.47 price for a while.  \nStock market API erroneously publishing 123.47 stock quotes for Amazon, eBay, Apple, MSFT and others. #infosec #nyse #nasdaq pic.twitter.com/jK2FG3E1VR— Robb Ware (@robbware) July 4, 2017\n\nAccording to a statement from Nasdaq, the error occurred after \"certain third parties improperly propagated test data that was distributed as part of the normal evening test procedures.\"\nWhile temporary, the glitch was scary, and reminiscent of the 2010 flash crash, in which major U.S. stock indexes, including Nasdaq, collapsed within minutes, erasing trillions of dollars of value before quickly rebounding. That, however, was a far more dangerous occurrence, as the stock prices really did plummet due to a combination of market manipulations and automated high-frequency trading tools which initiated a selling frenzy. \nMonday's glitch was different. Despite sporadic claims of some trades being made at the $123.47 price, Nasdaq told the FT that it did not affect market trading. The biggest consequences appear to be a bit of confusion among traders and a fun day for companies like Sears and Zynga, who saw their stock prices suddenly jump by a few thousand percent. \nWATCH: The future of selfies is this camera drone with facial recognition"},"shares":{"linked_in":513,"twitter":381,"google_plus":10,"facebook":227,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HD5cr-AeSEj3-VYrtBbyxGY5anY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F526213%2F7ca4c779-f75b-4336-b871-a7f8979fa0fc.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ilyz0EZDCaA2B75IRrVGUlkptVs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vvG96ZxowxKSyYSxD6UXtnz8TFE=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nEHZgvvn-Km5J8YuAk3nm_6EjW0=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ukMNq5","display_title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"R6k01Z9nVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"An odd glitch Monday caused the stock prices of several companies listed on Nasdaq to be exactly the same: $123.47.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday"},{"_id":"5964e46028cc360acf000816","id":"2017/07/11/how-to-track-amazon-prime-day-deals","title":"Here's how to track the hottest deals on Amazon Prime Day","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-07-11T14:44:47+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 14:44:47 +0000","formatted_date":" 23 hours ago","formatted_shares":"722","sort_key":"1DuY42","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/how-to-track-amazon-prime-day-deals/","content":{"plain":"Amazon Prime Day, the e-commerce bacchanal, is well underway, and if you want to make the most of it, you'll have to shop smart.\nThere are so many ridiculous deals out there — we're keeping track of the best of the best for you — but many of them won't drop until a predetermined time during the day. \nThese Lightning Deals will strike quickly and sell out fast, so you'll need to keep a close eye on them if you don't want to miss out. Thankfully, Amazon gives you the ability to track the products you're itching to buy, so that you won't miss out and get stuck on the Waitlist.\nHere's how to track the best deals on Prime Day.\nSEE ALSO: The real point of Amazon Prime Day\nOn a PC\nOn a PC, head over to Amazon using your web browser. Once you've logged into Prime, go to the Prime Day section of the site. Scroll on down to Upcoming Deals, where you'll be treated to a seemingly endless list of sales that will soon strike the site. Click on the \"Watch this deal\" button, and the product will be saved to a list in your account. \n\nScroll down further, and you'll be able to check out the deals you've selected to watch. There's not a ton of use here, since there are no desktop alerts, but it is helpful to keep everything in one place if you're planning on doing your Prime Day shopping on a computer.\n\nOn mobile\nThe easiest way to track your deal is on mobile the using Amazon app — unlike the browser version of the site, you'll be sent notifications directly to your smartphone. Instead of actively watching the screen and letting Prime Day dominate your life, you can kick back, relax, and let the deals come to you. \nBut before you do anything, make sure you turn on notifications within the app itself. If you don't set this up, you won't be able to get alerts when the sales are activated — so you can kiss those savings goodbye when the item sells out to all those other savvy Prime members out there. \nWhen you open your app, head to the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the page. Tap Settings, then Notifications. From there, just swipe on Your Watched & Waitlisted Deals, as seen below.  \n\nAfter that, you're ready to shop. To stake out the top Lightning Deals before they strike, swipe over to the Upcoming section of the Prime Day menu. \n\nAs you swipe through the feed of specials and something catches your eye, just press on the \"Watch this deal\" button underneath the product image. \n\nYou can keep track of all the deals your watching by swiping over in the Prime Day menu. Products you select on a PC will show up here, too.  \n\nWhen a deal goes live, you'll be alerted via push notification — if you have the proper settings activated.

Amazon had halved the gadget's price to $90 for the occasion.\nThe performance isn't much of a surprise considering how aggressively Amazon discounts and promotes its own electronic products each time the contrived date rolls around. Other big sellers this year included its miniature cousin, the Echo Dot, and Amazon's Fire 7 tablet.\nIt was selling \"thousands per minute.\"\nEven by the company's own standards, though, the Echo was a big sales hit this year. Amazon said the Echo had already doubled last year's total Prime Day haul in the U.S. and tripled it worldwide in about half the time. A source told TechCrunch it was selling \"thousands per minute.\"\nAmong the most popular deals without the Amazon stamp were 23andMe DNA tests and Senso Bluetooth headphones. And as far as sales by category, tech, home goods, and cooking-ware won the day.\nJust hours into the annual promotional holiday -- which was extended into the preceding night this year -- Amazon had already declared it a success, vaguely boasting of customers shopping at \"record levels\" without elaborating on what exactly that meant. The company did not immediately return our request for clarification.\nAmazon's heavy focus on its own gadgetry makes a lot of sense investment-wise. Even if it sells these products at a loss, they still provide valuable avenues through which it can insert its other business tentacles into people's lives. \nFor instance, Amazon now sets the default choice to its own in-house brands when shoppers ask Alexa -- Amazon's equivalent of Siri -- to order, say, batteries, provided they've bought them in the past. Brands are already experimenting with sponsored messages within Alexa, a capability that will no doubt be eventually folded into Amazon's burgeoning ads business.\nAs some analysts predicted, Amazon also took the promotional day as an opportunity to plug some of its newer apparel and food private labels that customers may not yet be familiar with. Prime-exclusive clothing -- a category that encompasses Amazon's new stable of fashion lines -- and grocery labels like Wickedly Prime snacks and Happy Belly coffee were all marked down as much as 50 percent. \nEven as competitors do their best to undercut the flagship promotional period, it seems Amazon still owns the day.\nWATCH: Amazon has so many orders that it needs its own cargo

All this said, it's a lot of information to dig through. Most of the sales are just mediocre — but there are a few that stand head and shoulders above the rest.\nWe've selected five of the absolute best deals available for Prime Day across all categories -- one's that you really shouldn't pass up. Inventory on the best deals tends to run out quickly, so if you like what you see, we'd recommend putting them in your shopping cart right away. With that in mind, here are the five best deals of Amazon Prime Day 2017.\nMotorola G5 Plus\n\nThe Moto G5 Plus gives you a solid Android phone at an insanely low price — it's less than $200. The unlocked handset rocks a 5.2-inch full HD screen and 64 GB of storage with an expandable microSD card slot for even more media. You'll also get a fingerprint scanner, and a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera. It's not quite as good as the Samsung Galaxy S8 bundle that sold out earlier today, but it's a close second, and great phone for the price.\nPrice: $180 (normally, $240)\nAmazon Echo \n\nNo list of Prime Day deals would be complete without one of Amazon's own gadgets — and the king of them all is the full-size Echo. The OG Alexa housing is heavily discounted for the day, as the Echo line is evolving with the new Show and Look devices — but the the cylindrical speaker is still well worth it, especially at nearly $100 off the original price. \nPrice: $89.99 (normally $179.99)\nPlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Console - Uncharted 4 Bundle\n\nGamers who've been Microsoft or Nintendo loyalists will have a shot snagging at one of the best consoles of its generation with this PS4 Slim bundle. Along with Uncharted 4 in the box, you'll get a download code for the hit The Last of Us and access to a package of Comixology comics, which includes Star Wars and Mass Effect titles. \nPrice: $229.00 (normally $299.99)\nGame of Thrones Complete Seasons 1-6 Blu-ray package\n\nIf you didn't already know, winter is here. The mega popular HBO epic series Game of Thrones returns to primetime this weekend — and if you're not caught up, you might be able to sneak in a quick binge with this box set. You can also snag the set in regular old DVD form for $81.99, down from the normal $189.99.\nPrice: $74.99 (normally $129.99)\nSony XB950B1 Extra Bass Wireless Headphones\n\nSony isn't necessarily the first brand you think of when you're looking for headphones, but these babies have thousands of great reviews and clock in at under $100 -- who can match that?

As in there appear to be zero deals on offer. Hellooooooo? \nType in “sex” and a search of Prime Day deals brings up plenty of revealing lingerie, but not a single get-off gadget. It’s a shame, really. People like to buy and use these bedroom aids just as much as they do Instant Pots, and Kindles, and Clarisonics. \nSEE ALSO: Amazon Prime Day: Amazon’s not-so-secret plan to rule the retail world\nYou can’t get a cock ring deal, but you can get one on this 3-pack of silicone wedding rings.  You can't get a discount Fleshlight, but you can get this tactical flashlight. You can get this ceramic rabbit ring holder, but good luck scoring a rabbit vibrator this Prime Day.\nDoes it not seem nutso that you can get special discounts all manner of snazzy electronics, personal care products, exercise equipment, and random tools, yet there is nary a vibrator or butt plug or dildo deal to be had?\n\nIt’s not as if Amazon has steered clear of sex toys as a general rule. On an average day, you can pick up a plethora of extremely NSFW pleasure-inducing tools. But for some reason, they don’t feel these products are worth celebrating as part of their biggest day of the year.\nWhy does this matter? Sex toys can be spendy, so all price breaks are appreciated. But more importantly a decision like this reinforces the outdated notion that they are somehow taboo or not the same as any other personal care or wellness product.\nSEE ALSO: A new Alexa skill will help you set the mood. Oh, and buy condoms.\nThat only worsens problems like the orgasm gap, wherein women do not experience the same satisfaction as men in the getting off department, and that is just plain unfair.\nHere's hoping next year will be a more pleasurable experience for Prime members everywhere. \nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"facebook":46,"google_plus":2,"twitter":154,"linked_in":1,"pinterest":1,"total":204},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5xjFOeTzLMHsEytjLLLcVtV6MRg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51053%2F977037f5-c5cd-4f4e-9c9f-1e3651f78a47.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/awfGQiN3jZqTxAdREKfubn0nSLg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51053%2F977037f5-c5cd-4f4e-9c9f-1e3651f78a47.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fHbnXGf7LIcY90raFo7uYmM91DE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51053%2F977037f5-c5cd-4f4e-9c9f-1e3651f78a47.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UTtZa9k82Sm7-MDhHvkSaWm6pNA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51053%2F977037f5-c5cd-4f4e-9c9f-1e3651f78a47.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ml87_2vvXEHLdDoI6TBFbFZc5ZY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51053%2F977037f5-c5cd-4f4e-9c9f-1e3651f78a47.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vKx-Q4F9XF1CEyQsqc2_Omssoxo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51053%2F977037f5-c5cd-4f4e-9c9f-1e3651f78a47.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2u52og9","display_title":"There's not a single Prime Day deal for sex toys?

Thankfully, Amazon gives you the ability to track the products you're itching to buy, so that you won't miss out and get stuck on the Waitlist.\nHere's how to track the best deals on Prime Day.\nSEE ALSO: The real point of Amazon Prime Day\nOn a PC\nOn a PC, head over to Amazon using your web browser. Once you've logged into Prime, go to the Prime Day section of the site. Scroll on down to Upcoming Deals, where you'll be treated to a seemingly endless list of sales that will soon strike the site. Click on the \"Watch this deal\" button, and the product will be saved to a list in your account. \n\nScroll down further, and you'll be able to check out the deals you've selected to watch. There's not a ton of use here, since there are no desktop alerts, but it is helpful to keep everything in one place if you're planning on doing your Prime Day shopping on a computer.\n\nOn mobile\nThe easiest way to track your deal is on mobile the using Amazon app — unlike the browser version of the site, you'll be sent notifications directly to your smartphone. Instead of actively watching the screen and letting Prime Day dominate your life, you can kick back, relax, and let the deals come to you. \nBut before you do anything, make sure you turn on notifications within the app itself. If you don't set this up, you won't be able to get alerts when the sales are activated — so you can kiss those savings goodbye when the item sells out to all those other savvy Prime members out there. \nWhen you open your app, head to the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the page. Tap Settings, then Notifications. From there, just swipe on Your Watched & Waitlisted Deals, as seen below.  \n\nAfter that, you're ready to shop. To stake out the top Lightning Deals before they strike, swipe over to the Upcoming section of the Prime Day menu. \n\nAs you swipe through the feed of specials and something catches your eye, just press on the \"Watch this deal\" button underneath the product image. \n\nYou can keep track of all the deals your watching by swiping over in the Prime Day menu. Products you select on a PC will show up here, too.  \n\nWhen a deal goes live, you'll be alerted via push notification — if you have the proper settings activated. If you want to win Prime Day, that's your first step. Otherwise, you'll spend the the sales extravaganza stuck on the waitlist.\nWATCH: This prosthetic is an extra thumb you never knew you needed\nEvery editorial product is independently selected by Mashable journalists.

Each package is preloaded by workers.\nSEE ALSO: Walmart tests a giant self-serve kiosk that dispenses groceries\nThe massive orange towers stand 16 feet tall by 8 feet wide and deliver items through a conveyor belt inside the contraption.

Earlier this year, Walmart unveiled a similar, much larger storage unit for grocery orders.\nWalmart is banking on its thousands of stores and army of store employees to serve as a key advantage in its ongoing war with the online shopping juggernaut. Other experiments that cater to these strengths include a program in which store workers deliver packages on the way home from work and a partnership with Uber for short-distance delivery orders.\nAmazon's pending blockbuster deal to acquire Whole Foods will only up the ante as the company leverages its own major network of brick-and-mortar stores for the first time.\nWATCH: Amazon has so many orders that it needs its own cargo plane\n  "},"shares":{"twitter":187,"facebook":361,"linked_in":1881,"google_plus":9,"pinterest":2,"total":2440},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TEUxzZhS3tOVmaG8y_km0Y1vg2A=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XzPlduuDNHXww_lY4PSR70XKj6g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hlDeCV96uoIEHTK0luJwHcSBMzs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MKlwpjvcHBTa1cV7kJ0bpmqovjo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vNuHEwerti-sAgRYIJrNShyAamQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5gEAln4eulQrhXFhfztwim5bdM0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tRmXfw","display_title":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"W3bokPB07M","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Walmart is doubling down on the human-free experience.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders"},{"_id":"595a8da6f11b2c72ce001641","id":"2017/07/03/whole-foods-recalls-chicken-salad-tuna","title":"Chicken salad at Whole Foods recalled for not containing ... chicken","title_tag":null,"author":"Shishira Sreenivas","post_date":"2017-07-03T18:32:05+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 18:32:05 +0000","formatted_date":"07/03/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1Ds8Hr","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/03/whole-foods-recalls-chicken-salad-tuna/","content":{"plain":"Looks like Whole Foods is back in the news--and this time, Amazon has nothing to do with it.\nThe grocery giant sent shoppers a recall alert for approximately 404 pounds of \"buffalo style chicken salad\" for actually being ... tuna salad.\nSEE ALSO: What will Whole Foods of the future, powered by Amazon, look like?\nThe salad, distributed by Willow Tree Poultry Farm in Attelboro, Mass., was wrongly labeled \"buffalo style chicken salad\" and was distributed to approximately 35 Whole Foods stores in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.\nHow do you know if your salad is included in the recall? If it's in a 12.5-ounce plastic container with the number P-8827 inside the USDA's inspection mark, you might be in trouble.\nIt's a cause for concern as tuna is a known food allergen. According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, symptoms of fish allergy could include hives, nausea, indigestion, stuffy noses, and in the worst case, anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction that impedes breathing and needs immediate medical attention.\nIn a statement to Mashable, Willow Tree confirmed that the error was first discovered by a Whole foods employee who realized the ready-made containers actually contained cranberry apple tuna salad.\nMashable also reached out to Whole Foods for comment, and will update the story when the company replies. \nThe USDA said there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions yet. \nUnfortunate shoppers who ended up with the product have been asked to toss it out or return it to their local store. \nToo bad we can't return the salad with free Amazon drone delivery yet.

If it were true, Google's market cap would fall from $623 billion to about $83 billion, while Microsoft's market cap would be propelled to nearly $1 trillion. \nSEE ALSO: New York Times is using Google’s AI to expand online comments\nThe odd occurrence was caused by a data glitch, the Financial Times reported late Monday, that affected only some of the stocks listed on Nasdaq. While the stock prices remained unaltered on Nasdaq itself, third-party services such as Google Finance and Bloomberg displayed the erroneous $123.47 price for a while.  \nStock market API erroneously publishing 123.47 stock quotes for Amazon, eBay, Apple, MSFT and others. #infosec #nyse #nasdaq pic.twitter.com/jK2FG3E1VR— Robb Ware (@robbware) July 4, 2017\n\nAccording to a statement from Nasdaq, the error occurred after \"certain third parties improperly propagated test data that was distributed as part of the normal evening test procedures.\"\nWhile temporary, the glitch was scary, and reminiscent of the 2010 flash crash, in which major U.S. stock indexes, including Nasdaq, collapsed within minutes, erasing trillions of dollars of value before quickly rebounding. That, however, was a far more dangerous occurrence, as the stock prices really did plummet due to a combination of market manipulations and automated high-frequency trading tools which initiated a selling frenzy. \nMonday's glitch was different. Despite sporadic claims of some trades being made at the $123.47 price, Nasdaq told the FT that it did not affect market trading. The biggest consequences appear to be a bit of confusion among traders and a fun day for companies like Sears and Zynga, who saw their stock prices suddenly jump by a few thousand percent. \nWATCH: The future of selfies is this camera drone with facial recognition"},"shares":{"linked_in":513,"twitter":381,"google_plus":10,"facebook":227,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HD5cr-AeSEj3-VYrtBbyxGY5anY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F526213%2F7ca4c779-f75b-4336-b871-a7f8979fa0fc.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ilyz0EZDCaA2B75IRrVGUlkptVs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RLoWJmGA8pwiV_Ma6sNf_UcXxVU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xc8LsWxC-AUY2bOq_ogzL5PNx7M=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tDhi3bArj6aoFDOxhEipPuJczgM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/shF4UqFEfSkyjOdZy5V5qb4BlCc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ukMNq5","display_title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"R6k01Z9nVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"An odd glitch Monday caused the stock prices of several companies listed on Nasdaq to be exactly the same: $123.47.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday"},{"_id":"5964e46028cc360acf000816","id":"2017/07/11/how-to-track-amazon-prime-day-deals","title":"Here's how to track the hottest deals on Amazon Prime Day","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-07-11T14:44:47+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 14:44:47 +0000","formatted_date":" 23 hours ago","formatted_shares":"722","sort_key":"1DuY42","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/how-to-track-amazon-prime-day-deals/","content":{"plain":"Amazon Prime Day, the e-commerce bacchanal, is well underway, and if you want to make the most of it, you'll have to shop smart.\nThere are so many ridiculous deals out there — we're keeping track of the best of the best for you — but many of them won't drop until a predetermined time during the day. \nThese Lightning Deals will strike quickly and sell out fast, so you'll need to keep a close eye on them if you don't want to miss out. Thankfully, Amazon gives you the ability to track the products you're itching to buy, so that you won't miss out and get stuck on the Waitlist.\nHere's how to track the best deals on Prime Day.\nSEE ALSO: The real point of Amazon Prime Day\nOn a PC\nOn a PC, head over to Amazon using your web browser. Once you've logged into Prime, go to the Prime Day section of the site. Scroll on down to Upcoming Deals, where you'll be treated to a seemingly endless list of sales that will soon strike the site. Click on the \"Watch this deal\" button, and the product will be saved to a list in your account. \n\nScroll down further, and you'll be able to check out the deals you've selected to watch. There's not a ton of use here, since there are no desktop alerts, but it is helpful to keep everything in one place if you're planning on doing your Prime Day shopping on a computer.\n\nOn mobile\nThe easiest way to track your deal is on mobile the using Amazon app — unlike the browser version of the site, you'll be sent notifications directly to your smartphone. Instead of actively watching the screen and letting Prime Day dominate your life, you can kick back, relax, and let the deals come to you. \nBut before you do anything, make sure you turn on notifications within the app itself. If you don't set this up, you won't be able to get alerts when the sales are activated — so you can kiss those savings goodbye when the item sells out to all those other savvy Prime members out there. \nWhen you open your app, head to the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the page. Tap Settings, then Notifications. From there, just swipe on Your Watched & Waitlisted Deals, as seen below.  \n\nAfter that, you're ready to shop. To stake out the top Lightning Deals before they strike, swipe over to the Upcoming section of the Prime Day menu. \n\nAs you swipe through the feed of specials and something catches your eye, just press on the \"Watch this deal\" button underneath the product image. \n\nYou can keep track of all the deals your watching by swiping over in the Prime Day menu. Products you select on a PC will show up here, too.  \n\nWhen a deal goes live, you'll be alerted via push notification — if you have the proper settings activated.

According to authorities, the speaker heard these words, \"did you call the sheriffs\" and then called the police.\nSEE ALSO: Smart speaker calls 911 during domestic dispute, police rescue woman and daughter\nOn Sunday the Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. in New Mexico identified the incredibly helpful speaker as a Google Home device, only to recant a few hours later. \nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nGoogle confirmed on Monday to Mashable via email that not only did early reports misidentify the device, but Google Home still doesn't allow calling -- of any kind. \"That feature was announced at I/O, but hasn't been launched yet,\" wrote a spokesperson.\nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nSimilarly, Amazon confirmed to us via email that its voice assistant Alexa does not support calling 911. When we asked if there are any conditions under which this scenario could have occurred with an Amazon Echo Device, a spokesperson added, \"Alexa calling and messaging does not support calling 911, nor is the Alexa calling and messaging service able to connect to third-party calling services to do so.\" \nThere's even an Alexa Skills policy that disallows developers from including the ability to call 911 within their skills.\nWhich means it was, potentially, the \"sheriffs\" phrase that prompted Alexa's action. Mashable tried the phrase, \"did you call the sheriffs\" with both an Amazon Echo Show and Google Home. Neither responded. Even when engaged with the proper trigger words, Alexa and Home didn't understand the phrase as something actionable.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office deputy and spokesperson Felicia Romero admitted to Mashable on Monday that they're not particularly tech-savvy and are unsure of what device was hooked up to the Amazon Alexa system. They did not take photos of the scene.\nInstead, Romero described how Barros allegedly said, \"Did you call the sheriffs?\" which they believe may have been interpreted as \"Call the Sheriffs.\" \"Maybe \"Sheriff\" is programmed on the phone,\" offered Deputy Romero. Ultimately, they don't know what the system heard as a prompt.\nAmazon did introduce voice-calling features in May that work across all of its Echo devices as well as the Alexa app on iOS and Android. These systems can pull in your smartphone contacts and let you call them directly through an Alexa-enabled device. Even so, you always have to say \"Alexa, call [name of contact]\" to initiate an Alexa call.\nSome of the confusion surrounding this story can be traced back to the original police report, which Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. provided on Monday. Here's an excerpt:\nBarros then asked [the alleged victim] ‘did you call the Sheriff’s”. At this point Alexis [sic] which Affiant knows to be a Google Smart Radio, heard “call Sheriff’s”. Alexis the radio then called 911. This is when 911 was notified and deputies responded.  \nAs for the stereo system, the spokesperson explained that Alexa is connected to it and it's spread throughout the home so Barros can answer a phone call from any room in the house. Typically, Amazon's original Echo devices, which include a speaker (as does Google Home), are stand-alone devices. The cheaper, smaller Echo Dot, which includes a microphone listening array, but only a tiny speaker, is often hooked up to a user's stereo system. However, the Sheriff's Dept. offered no insight on which Alexa-supporting device Barros owns. \nWhat they did tell us, though, is that, just prior to the argument, the couple was using an Amazon system to watch a movie. \nEven with these new details, questions remain. Virtually all smart assistants, including smart home speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, listen only for their trigger words -- \"Alexa\" and \"Okay, Google\" (\"Hey, Siri\" for Apple's Siri) -- before listening for general commands and acting. It's unclear what words, if any preceded the \"sheriff\" comment.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office can confirm the existence of a call because, Deputy Romero told us, the line was left open and, in addition to the fighting the victim can be overheard in the background saying, \"Alexa, call 911,\" seemingly unaware that a call had already been made and that calling 911 isn't enabled on Amazon Echo devices.\nWe may never know exactly how (or if) Alexa made that call, but one thing is clear, the digital act may have saved someone's life.\nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"twitter":331,"facebook":261,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":36,"total":636},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MkGkoA09uIIqrLhh0Fhz7YBHTfA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531007%2F1ad09c39-e3a9-4b48-90f3-bfe3001dd670.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cMQpfrYM4H0LIIZrK6VbpvbaWzM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p2yUGLf_HRfnYRNRM6dEkkX2wVg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zWlSjZKCdkgP4oJ22jA7tM5rfsU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bdYbgGfaJIq2X-w6mKz7UkpEUog=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tLtr-3SbAP4R0kzfEjMysJJEX84=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2v4q4Oy","display_title":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvwg8okX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Did Alexa answer a cry for help?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute"},{"_id":"595d83ebf11b2c594a00011c","id":"2017/07/05/aoc-fa-studio-porsche-stylish-monitor","title":"Porsche and AOC's sleek new monitor is absolutely beautiful","title_tag":null,"author":"Molly Sequin","post_date":"2017-07-06T00:27:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:27:22 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"548","sort_key":"1DsVak","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/aoc-fa-studio-porsche-stylish-monitor/","content":{"plain":"A luxury car designer and HD display technology expert walk into a bar. The result? A single cable monitor.\nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nAOC and Studio F.A. Porsche partnered to bring the world a sleek, new monitor with just a single cable. The monitor comes in two versions -- the 24-inch PDS241 and 27-inch PDS271.\nThe premise of the new monitor is to provide something that's actually worth looking at to your workspace. Many other monitors are extremely functional and durable, but the loads of cords coming out of them can make your desk look like a wreck. \nAlong with the lone cable coming out of the back of the monitor, this new design gets some of its sleekness from how thin it is. The monitor boasts a 5.2mm depth, but it does get a little thicker at the bottom to house the internal electronics.\n\nThe connected breakout box includes the HDMI port and power port. This is arguably the bulkiest part of the monitor, but it's the same silver color as the rest, which helps it blend in a bit. \nThe smaller monitor sells for $199.99 while the larger model goes for $249.99. They'll be released exclusively on Amazon.com starting on July 24. \nWhile it looks great and comes at a reasonable price, the monitor has a few drawbacks.\nIt's not meant to be used with a gaming system like a lot of AOC's other products are. With the refresh rate capped at 60Hz, fast-moving images might turn up a little blurry. \nOn top of that, the monitor saved space on something that might make consumers a little upset -- there are no external speakers. This means you'll either have plug in your headphones every time you want to listen to something or buy external speakers.\n\nWhile the single cord design looks really neat, it also means that you can only plug in one device with the lone HDMI port. \nEven considering the slight drawbacks, this is a pretty cool monitor. Anyone who's deep into the specialized worlds of gaming or movie editing probably has a specific monitor to accomplish those tasks. But for consumers looking to complete normal tasks on a slightly more stylish monitor, AOC and Studio F.A. Porsche's new creation could make a great addition to your workspace. \nWATCH: This giant kinetic sculpture is actually a shape-shifting human face"},"shares":{"facebook":131,"linked_in":12,"twitter":396,"google_plus":8,"pinterest":1,"total":548},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1Y6OqYqTf2diiIYL38pUkU-99hI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527594%2F75e7f1bd-d8e0-4843-a1fb-f5f9e9507f19.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dO0nCmO-XAxsbFd-Qr-VXDBcZ94=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8U2dm2MOBh05O4Xoqhl6wtrN7Xg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xkrf4XyGz3sVxCrJQxb9VVpm_mQ=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TZIHw29AuT0in91J566T6spILEk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9QUgffF9lzbKwr44diUm1aF46bM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2trfLEF","display_title":"Porsche and AOC's sleek new monitor is absolutely beautiful","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOzPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Want.

Think of it like Black Friday on a Tuesday in the middle of summer or Christmas in July if you’re capable of planning your holiday shopping that far in advance.\nIt’s also another piece in Amazon’s strategy to become the Buy n Large of our times.\nSEE ALSO: Amazon announces third annual Prime Day, so goodbye bank account\nOver the past three years, Amazon has effectively built its eponymous day into a new shopping holiday, one that generates impressive amounts of FOMO if you’re not able to participate.\nThe golden ticket is, of course, a $99 Amazon Prime account. It’s the rapidly spinning wheel at the center of Amazon’s growing spokes of services and benefits that include free two-day shipping, streaming video and music, free content storage and access to All. Those. Deals.\nI’ve been a Prime member for years, but have some complicated feelings about Amazon and Prime Day. The company is driving inexorable change across the entire retail experience. Amazon is now a home page for many people. The first stop for any thought that could lead to a purchase. Its hardware has made Amazon inescapable with Alexa always waiting, listening for a new request. Amazon is seeking a level of shopping homogeny that sometimes gives me pause.\nPrime Day is also, obviously, an invention, something like the invented holidays that force us to remember family members one day a year as opposed to year-round. We know we should be better than this, yet we can’t ignore the forced-cheer and magnetic pull of a designated day – especially when they dangle the promise of spectacular deals in front of your face.\nLike everyone else, I get sucked in and, on the Prime Day, start poring over all the deals. It is the browsing act that I find most satisfying since, if we’re being honest here, many of the deals are for off-brand products (you won’t find Apple in there) or gear, gadgets and doo-dads we’ll never use and really don’t need.\nLike everyone else, I get sucked in and, on the Prime Day, start poring over all the deals.\nSome of the best deals are, unsurprisingly, reserved for Amazon’s own collection of services (Unlimited Music Streaming) and hardware: the Alexa-hosting Echos, Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders.  But, if you’re already a Prime Member, you probably already own one or more of these devices (I have at least one of each). \nSo, if so many people will browse and not buy, why have such a day?\nEven if only a small percentage of people shopping Amazon Prime Day deals find exactly whey they’re looking for, it doesn’t matter to Amazon.\nThe goal of the day is not massive product sales, though I’m sure Amazon won’t mind that happening.\nDuring a recent MashTalk Podcast recording, Mashable Business Reporter Emma Hinchcliffe posited that the goal is simply more Prime Members and I found myself in wild agreement.\nYes, Amazon will make serious bank if it sells millions of items on its special day, but nothing is more valuable to a business than annuities, fixed, recurring payments that can be relied on a monthly or yearly basis.\nOnce you sign up with Amazon Prime at $99, it’s doubtful you will ever end that subscription, and that’s not because you join and forget about it. In my house, Amazon Prime isn’t important one day of the year, it’s a service we access weekly and sometimes daily. Sometimes it’s something as simple as streaming music for free through my Amazon Echo. Other times, it’s getting a much-needed school book in my daughter’s hands within 48 hours. It might be one-button access via Amazon Dash to toothpaste or toilet paper.\nAnd Amazon Prime holds the potential of becoming even more useful in the coming months as Amazon concludes its Whole Foods acquisition and radically alters its distribution model. Everyone thinks that the next big wave of delivery technology from Amazon is going to be drones, but that’s just a shiny sideshow. The real story is what all those giant food stores, physical locations with lots of floor space, will do to Prime delivery. Will it become 1-day or even hours delivery? That’s possible if Prime Membership adds a pick-up-yourself service, using a portion of Whole Foods to stock often-purchased items, including Amazon hardware.\nAmazon doesn’t share its Prime subscriber numbers, but one recent estimate put it at 80 million. That’s a strong number, but leaves more than two thirds of the U.S. population on the table (Amazon Prime and Prime Day are global operations, too. Just imagine the global Prime Membership opportunity). People who are probably already watching the wall-to-wall coverage of this invested day and wondering, “How do I get in on that?”\nLast year, Amazon Prime day added, according to estimates, half a billion dollars to Amazon’s revenue. With Amazon’s aggressive marketing push and all the attention media (yes, including Mashable) is paying, this year will be even bigger. But the hidden impact will be the million or more new Amazon Prime customers all lining up to buy everything from shoes and TVs to computers and cookies not just one day a year, but every day and, very likely, forever. \nWATCH: What it's like to use an Amazon Echo Show"},"shares":{"facebook":53,"linked_in":220,"twitter":234,"google_plus":3,"total":510},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5F8YeMda9zM5ocQs56Z_5BRnaEs=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529257%2F274e7b51-52df-486d-8184-e3b6eb4a0d90.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u6rir5h_Kg5O7hEKBpnPuqO9aIY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50771%2F80bf0346-2c23-4a6e-824c-0a5cb5f1aaf4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/c4-qd1T7ccSXFpHzBzZZRAURLBI=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50771%2F80bf0346-2c23-4a6e-824c-0a5cb5f1aaf4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QGJOoZBZC_LLWpJYuPIRVbIz3xU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50771%2F80bf0346-2c23-4a6e-824c-0a5cb5f1aaf4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-oT7L_wTW_iXcW6qF4si2xQbOHE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50771%2F80bf0346-2c23-4a6e-824c-0a5cb5f1aaf4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IN9F2FFwEAUOwLZq3DrQQUvu1RI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50771%2F80bf0346-2c23-4a6e-824c-0a5cb5f1aaf4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tUOwVf","display_title":"Amazon Prime Day: Amazon’s not-so-secret plan to rule the retail world","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlv7DZokX","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Prime Day is not about the sales.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Amazon Prime Day: Amazon’s not-so-secret plan to rule the retail world"},{"_id":"596396ad28cc36557d0015a7","id":"2017/07/10/amazon-geek-squad-competitor","title":"Amazon is launching its own Geek Squad competitor","title_tag":null,"author":"Michael Nuñez","post_date":"2017-07-10T15:00:08+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 15:00:08 +0000","formatted_date":"07/10/2017","formatted_shares":"483","sort_key":"1DuB2D","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/amazon-geek-squad-competitor/","content":{"plain":"Amazon is stretching its tentacles into a wide range of different industries and services.

Once you've logged into Prime, go to the Prime Day section of the site. Scroll on down to Upcoming Deals, where you'll be treated to a seemingly endless list of sales that will soon strike the site. Click on the \"Watch this deal\" button, and the product will be saved to a list in your account. \n\nScroll down further, and you'll be able to check out the deals you've selected to watch. There's not a ton of use here, since there are no desktop alerts, but it is helpful to keep everything in one place if you're planning on doing your Prime Day shopping on a computer.\n\nOn mobile\nThe easiest way to track your deal is on mobile the using Amazon app — unlike the browser version of the site, you'll be sent notifications directly to your smartphone. Instead of actively watching the screen and letting Prime Day dominate your life, you can kick back, relax, and let the deals come to you. \nBut before you do anything, make sure you turn on notifications within the app itself. If you don't set this up, you won't be able to get alerts when the sales are activated — so you can kiss those savings goodbye when the item sells out to all those other savvy Prime members out there. \nWhen you open your app, head to the dropdown menu in the top left corner of the page. Tap Settings, then Notifications. From there, just swipe on Your Watched & Waitlisted Deals, as seen below.  \n\nAfter that, you're ready to shop. To stake out the top Lightning Deals before they strike, swipe over to the Upcoming section of the Prime Day menu. \n\nAs you swipe through the feed of specials and something catches your eye, just press on the \"Watch this deal\" button underneath the product image. \n\nYou can keep track of all the deals your watching by swiping over in the Prime Day menu. Products you select on a PC will show up here, too.  \n\nWhen a deal goes live, you'll be alerted via push notification — if you have the proper settings activated. If you want to win Prime Day, that's your first step. Otherwise, you'll spend the the sales extravaganza stuck on the waitlist.\nWATCH: This prosthetic is an extra thumb you never knew you needed\nEvery editorial product is independently selected by Mashable journalists.

According to authorities, the speaker heard these words, \"did you call the sheriffs\" and then called the police.\nSEE ALSO: Smart speaker calls 911 during domestic dispute, police rescue woman and daughter\nOn Sunday the Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. in New Mexico identified the incredibly helpful speaker as a Google Home device, only to recant a few hours later. \nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nGoogle confirmed on Monday to Mashable via email that not only did early reports misidentify the device, but Google Home still doesn't allow calling -- of any kind. \"That feature was announced at I/O, but hasn't been launched yet,\" wrote a spokesperson.\nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nSimilarly, Amazon confirmed to us via email that its voice assistant Alexa does not support calling 911. When we asked if there are any conditions under which this scenario could have occurred with an Amazon Echo Device, a spokesperson added, \"Alexa calling and messaging does not support calling 911, nor is the Alexa calling and messaging service able to connect to third-party calling services to do so.\" \nThere's even an Alexa Skills policy that disallows developers from including the ability to call 911 within their skills.\nWhich means it was, potentially, the \"sheriffs\" phrase that prompted Alexa's action. Mashable tried the phrase, \"did you call the sheriffs\" with both an Amazon Echo Show and Google Home. Neither responded. Even when engaged with the proper trigger words, Alexa and Home didn't understand the phrase as something actionable.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office deputy and spokesperson Felicia Romero admitted to Mashable on Monday that they're not particularly tech-savvy and are unsure of what device was hooked up to the Amazon Alexa system. They did not take photos of the scene.\nInstead, Romero described how Barros allegedly said, \"Did you call the sheriffs?\" which they believe may have been interpreted as \"Call the Sheriffs.\" \"Maybe \"Sheriff\" is programmed on the phone,\" offered Deputy Romero. Ultimately, they don't know what the system heard as a prompt.\nAmazon did introduce voice-calling features in May that work across all of its Echo devices as well as the Alexa app on iOS and Android. These systems can pull in your smartphone contacts and let you call them directly through an Alexa-enabled device. Even so, you always have to say \"Alexa, call [name of contact]\" to initiate an Alexa call.\nSome of the confusion surrounding this story can be traced back to the original police report, which Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. provided on Monday. Here's an excerpt:\nBarros then asked [the alleged victim] ‘did you call the Sheriff’s”. At this point Alexis [sic] which Affiant knows to be a Google Smart Radio, heard “call Sheriff’s”. Alexis the radio then called 911. This is when 911 was notified and deputies responded.  \nAs for the stereo system, the spokesperson explained that Alexa is connected to it and it's spread throughout the home so Barros can answer a phone call from any room in the house. Typically, Amazon's original Echo devices, which include a speaker (as does Google Home), are stand-alone devices. The cheaper, smaller Echo Dot, which includes a microphone listening array, but only a tiny speaker, is often hooked up to a user's stereo system. However, the Sheriff's Dept. offered no insight on which Alexa-supporting device Barros owns. \nWhat they did tell us, though, is that, just prior to the argument, the couple was using an Amazon system to watch a movie. \nEven with these new details, questions remain. Virtually all smart assistants, including smart home speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, listen only for their trigger words -- \"Alexa\" and \"Okay, Google\" (\"Hey, Siri\" for Apple's Siri) -- before listening for general commands and acting. It's unclear what words, if any preceded the \"sheriff\" comment.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office can confirm the existence of a call because, Deputy Romero told us, the line was left open and, in addition to the fighting the victim can be overheard in the background saying, \"Alexa, call 911,\" seemingly unaware that a call had already been made and that calling 911 isn't enabled on Amazon Echo devices.\nWe may never know exactly how (or if) Alexa made that call, but one thing is clear, the digital act may have saved someone's life.\nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"twitter":331,"facebook":261,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":36,"total":636},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MkGkoA09uIIqrLhh0Fhz7YBHTfA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531007%2F1ad09c39-e3a9-4b48-90f3-bfe3001dd670.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cMQpfrYM4H0LIIZrK6VbpvbaWzM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p2yUGLf_HRfnYRNRM6dEkkX2wVg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zWlSjZKCdkgP4oJ22jA7tM5rfsU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bdYbgGfaJIq2X-w6mKz7UkpEUog=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tLtr-3SbAP4R0kzfEjMysJJEX84=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2v4q4Oy","display_title":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvwg8okX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Did Alexa answer a cry for help?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute"},{"_id":"595ea02228cc3667b000008c","id":"2017/07/06/walmart-vending-machines-pick-up-orders","title":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-07-06T20:39:58+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 20:39:58 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"2.4k","sort_key":"1DteKS","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/06/walmart-vending-machines-pick-up-orders/","content":{"plain":"{\"player\":{\"description\":null,\"image\":\"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ewYjNjJqu4zxQAP1oTfm9Td45lk=/https%3A%2F%2Fvdist.aws.mashable.com%2Fcms%2F2017%2F7%2F979fc9e3-d062-3744%2Fthumb%2F00001.jpg\",\"mediaid\":\"eGlv71YokX\",\"preload\":false,\"title\":\"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders\",\"sources\":[{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/7/979fc9e3-d062-3744/hls.m3u8\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/7/979fc9e3-d062-3744/dash.mpd\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/7/979fc9e3-d062-3744/mp4/1080.mp4\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/7/979fc9e3-d062-3744/mp4/720.mp4\"},{\"file\":\"https://vdist.aws.mashable.com/cms/2017/7/979fc9e3-d062-3744/mp4/480.mp4\"}]},\"options\":{\"disableAds\":false,\"disableSharing\":false,\"embedUrl\":\"http://mashable.com/videos/blueprint:eGlv71YokX/embed/?player=offsite\",\"standaloneUrl\":null,\"post\":{\"url\":\"http://mashable.com/2017/07/06/walmart-vending-machines-pick-up-orders/\",\"date\":\"2017-07-06T20:39:58.000Z\",\"bp_id\":50716,\"wp_id\":null}},\"advertising\":{\"params\":{\"keywords\":\"\",\"sec0\":null,\"sec1\":\"\",\"prc\":\"\"}},\"analytics\":{\"labels\":\"\",\"videoSeriesName\":null}}Walmart is on a quest to make its in-store pickup process free of human interaction.\nThe big-box store is rolling out a giant self-serve kiosk tower for online orders to more than a dozen locations.

Each package is preloaded by workers.\nSEE ALSO: Walmart tests a giant self-serve kiosk that dispenses groceries\nThe massive orange towers stand 16 feet tall by 8 feet wide and deliver items through a conveyor belt inside the contraption. Walmart began testing the system last fall in an Arkansas store near its headquarters.\n\nThe device isn't the only giant vending machine being implemented as the retailer looks for ways to compete with Amazon's hyper-efficient service. Earlier this year, Walmart unveiled a similar, much larger storage unit for grocery orders.\nWalmart is banking on its thousands of stores and army of store employees to serve as a key advantage in its ongoing war with the online shopping juggernaut. Other experiments that cater to these strengths include a program in which store workers deliver packages on the way home from work and a partnership with Uber for short-distance delivery orders.\nAmazon's pending blockbuster deal to acquire Whole Foods will only up the ante as the company leverages its own major network of brick-and-mortar stores for the first time.\nWATCH: Amazon has so many orders that it needs its own cargo plane\n  "},"shares":{"twitter":187,"facebook":361,"linked_in":1881,"google_plus":9,"pinterest":2,"total":2440},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TEUxzZhS3tOVmaG8y_km0Y1vg2A=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XzPlduuDNHXww_lY4PSR70XKj6g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hlDeCV96uoIEHTK0luJwHcSBMzs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MKlwpjvcHBTa1cV7kJ0bpmqovjo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vNuHEwerti-sAgRYIJrNShyAamQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5gEAln4eulQrhXFhfztwim5bdM0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50716%2F20652e22-0ccd-43e6-89ff-daf600a9a407.jpeg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tRmXfw","display_title":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"W3bokPB07M","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Walmart is doubling down on the human-free experience.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Walmart is rolling out giant vending machines for online pickup orders"},{"_id":"595d83ebf11b2c594a00011c","id":"2017/07/05/aoc-fa-studio-porsche-stylish-monitor","title":"Porsche and AOC's sleek new monitor is absolutely beautiful","title_tag":null,"author":"Molly Sequin","post_date":"2017-07-06T00:27:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 00:27:22 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"548","sort_key":"1DsVak","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/aoc-fa-studio-porsche-stylish-monitor/","content":{"plain":"A luxury car designer and HD display technology expert walk into a bar. The result? A single cable monitor.\nSEE ALSO: Step inside the secretive class that turns people into hackers\nAOC and Studio F.A. Porsche partnered to bring the world a sleek, new monitor with just a single cable. The monitor comes in two versions -- the 24-inch PDS241 and 27-inch PDS271.\nThe premise of the new monitor is to provide something that's actually worth looking at to your workspace. Many other monitors are extremely functional and durable, but the loads of cords coming out of them can make your desk look like a wreck. \nAlong with the lone cable coming out of the back of the monitor, this new design gets some of its sleekness from how thin it is. The monitor boasts a 5.2mm depth, but it does get a little thicker at the bottom to house the internal electronics.\n\nThe connected breakout box includes the HDMI port and power port. This is arguably the bulkiest part of the monitor, but it's the same silver color as the rest, which helps it blend in a bit. \nThe smaller monitor sells for $199.99 while the larger model goes for $249.99. They'll be released exclusively on Amazon.com starting on July 24. \nWhile it looks great and comes at a reasonable price, the monitor has a few drawbacks.\nIt's not meant to be used with a gaming system like a lot of AOC's other products are. With the refresh rate capped at 60Hz, fast-moving images might turn up a little blurry. \nOn top of that, the monitor saved space on something that might make consumers a little upset -- there are no external speakers. This means you'll either have plug in your headphones every time you want to listen to something or buy external speakers.\n\nWhile the single cord design looks really neat, it also means that you can only plug in one device with the lone HDMI port. \nEven considering the slight drawbacks, this is a pretty cool monitor. Anyone who's deep into the specialized worlds of gaming or movie editing probably has a specific monitor to accomplish those tasks. But for consumers looking to complete normal tasks on a slightly more stylish monitor, AOC and Studio F.A. Porsche's new creation could make a great addition to your workspace. \nWATCH: This giant kinetic sculpture is actually a shape-shifting human face"},"shares":{"facebook":131,"linked_in":12,"twitter":396,"google_plus":8,"pinterest":1,"total":548},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1Y6OqYqTf2diiIYL38pUkU-99hI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527594%2F75e7f1bd-d8e0-4843-a1fb-f5f9e9507f19.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dO0nCmO-XAxsbFd-Qr-VXDBcZ94=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8U2dm2MOBh05O4Xoqhl6wtrN7Xg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xkrf4XyGz3sVxCrJQxb9VVpm_mQ=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TZIHw29AuT0in91J566T6spILEk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9QUgffF9lzbKwr44diUm1aF46bM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50606%2F2c9df17d-d010-4498-86f6-975504430ec4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2trfLEF","display_title":"Porsche and AOC's sleek new monitor is absolutely beautiful","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOzPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Want.

If it were true, Google's market cap would fall from $623 billion to about $83 billion, while Microsoft's market cap would be propelled to nearly $1 trillion. \nSEE ALSO: New York Times is using Google’s AI to expand online comments\nThe odd occurrence was caused by a data glitch, the Financial Times reported late Monday, that affected only some of the stocks listed on Nasdaq. While the stock prices remained unaltered on Nasdaq itself, third-party services such as Google Finance and Bloomberg displayed the erroneous $123.47 price for a while.  \nStock market API erroneously publishing 123.47 stock quotes for Amazon, eBay, Apple, MSFT and others. #infosec #nyse #nasdaq pic.twitter.com/jK2FG3E1VR— Robb Ware (@robbware) July 4, 2017\n\nAccording to a statement from Nasdaq, the error occurred after \"certain third parties improperly propagated test data that was distributed as part of the normal evening test procedures.\"\nWhile temporary, the glitch was scary, and reminiscent of the 2010 flash crash, in which major U.S. stock indexes, including Nasdaq, collapsed within minutes, erasing trillions of dollars of value before quickly rebounding. That, however, was a far more dangerous occurrence, as the stock prices really did plummet due to a combination of market manipulations and automated high-frequency trading tools which initiated a selling frenzy. \nMonday's glitch was different. Despite sporadic claims of some trades being made at the $123.47 price, Nasdaq told the FT that it did not affect market trading. The biggest consequences appear to be a bit of confusion among traders and a fun day for companies like Sears and Zynga, who saw their stock prices suddenly jump by a few thousand percent. \nWATCH: The future of selfies is this camera drone with facial recognition"},"shares":{"linked_in":513,"twitter":381,"google_plus":10,"facebook":227,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HD5cr-AeSEj3-VYrtBbyxGY5anY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F526213%2F7ca4c779-f75b-4336-b871-a7f8979fa0fc.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ilyz0EZDCaA2B75IRrVGUlkptVs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RLoWJmGA8pwiV_Ma6sNf_UcXxVU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xc8LsWxC-AUY2bOq_ogzL5PNx7M=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tDhi3bArj6aoFDOxhEipPuJczgM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/shF4UqFEfSkyjOdZy5V5qb4BlCc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ukMNq5","display_title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"R6k01Z9nVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"An odd glitch Monday caused the stock prices of several companies listed on Nasdaq to be exactly the same: $123.47.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday"},{"_id":"595a8da6f11b2c72ce001641","id":"2017/07/03/whole-foods-recalls-chicken-salad-tuna","title":"Chicken salad at Whole Foods recalled for not containing ... chicken","title_tag":null,"author":"Shishira Sreenivas","post_date":"2017-07-03T18:32:05+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 18:32:05 +0000","formatted_date":"07/03/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1Ds8Hr","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/03/whole-foods-recalls-chicken-salad-tuna/","content":{"plain":"Looks like Whole Foods is back in the news--and this time, Amazon has nothing to do with it.\nThe grocery giant sent shoppers a recall alert for approximately 404 pounds of \"buffalo style chicken salad\" for actually being ... tuna salad.\nSEE ALSO: What will Whole Foods of the future, powered by Amazon, look like?\nThe salad, distributed by Willow Tree Poultry Farm in Attelboro, Mass., was wrongly labeled \"buffalo style chicken salad\" and was distributed to approximately 35 Whole Foods stores in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.\nHow do you know if your salad is included in the recall? If it's in a 12.5-ounce plastic container with the number P-8827 inside the USDA's inspection mark, you might be in trouble.\nIt's a cause for concern as tuna is a known food allergen. According to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, symptoms of fish allergy could include hives, nausea, indigestion, stuffy noses, and in the worst case, anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction that impedes breathing and needs immediate medical attention.\nIn a statement to Mashable, Willow Tree confirmed that the error was first discovered by a Whole foods employee who realized the ready-made containers actually contained cranberry apple tuna salad.\nMashable also reached out to Whole Foods for comment, and will update the story when the company replies. \nThe USDA said there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions yet. \nUnfortunate shoppers who ended up with the product have been asked to toss it out or return it to their local store. \nToo bad we can't return the salad with free Amazon drone delivery yet.

Calling one of the features on its site a \"smart address book,\" PlanetAll allowed users to connect with other groups around particular interests, offered news updates, horoscopes, and offered a calendar reminder service that worked with the then popular Palm Pilot mobile organizer.\nHowever, the move wasn't an example of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos somehow having the foresight to make Amazon a social network before Mark Zuckerberg. Instead, Amazon's acquisition was primarily designed to help Amazon get its books to more people. \n\n\"Portals are a great business to be in, but it just doesn't happen to be our business,\" said Bezos following the announcement of the acquisition. \"Amazon is and has always been focused on being an ecommerce destination, and that will remain the focus.\"\nBut as the Timeline profile on PlanetAll notes, Bezos and his team later realized its mistake and filed a patent application in 2008 for a 'social networking system,' but by then it was too late, a social networking gold rush was already in effect.   \n\"Portals are a great business to be in, but it just doesn't happen to be our business.\"\nAs for the title of \"first social network,\" that title belongs to GeoCities, which arrived around a year before PlanetAll and was eventually acquired by Yahoo. You see a trend here? The early players in social media that sold out too quickly soon disappeared under a fog of parent company mechanics, a fate Facebook managed to successfully avoid to become the world's biggest social network. \nRemember this the next time you think back to why Snapchat repeatedly turned down multi-billion dollar acquisition offers in just the last few years from Facebook. \nBut despite Bezos' apparent miss, he may ultimately have the last laugh. From the ubiquitous Amazon Prime, to the Kindle and internet appliance Amazon Show, to its growing reach in brick and mortar retail via Whole Foods, it's beginning to look like we'll all be using Amazon soon, in one way or another. \nWATCH: Willy Wonka's sideways-moving elevator could soon become a reality"},"shares":{"twitter":496,"facebook":180,"linked_in":27,"google_plus":14,"pinterest":2,"total":719},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VAEv-KklEg7xGxsOpNiT17TMZO8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525260%2F8b4853dc-e0a0-4933-96a4-b979df4bd8ac.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jo3qzS4o3fQdSFRytkHYJDkkLhk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HT3jTXDe4aAWRui39GdQ0x4zNTU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8Lwyk12QyI8TITgaqoYfWLsf_mA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/89BNhPnPB2h-ddD10PN2FLl_IL8=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nv6ZWDYazF-NrKIxGmLT4aJyuKw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50387%2Fcf1e5a0c-b486-4925-92e8-de1053a117ba.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uvtKsn","display_title":"That time Amazon had a social network years before Facebook","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOBPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Back when social networking was something many considered just another internet gamble not worth taking.

At around 9:00 a.m. on June 28, President Trump tweeted the following:\nThe #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017\n\nAside from the obvious inaccuracies in the president's tweet -- Amazon doesn't own The Washington Post (I do), the Post isn't \"the guardian of Amazon,\" and it isn't fake news -- there's one massive, glaring issue that I take with the message. \nContrary to what Mr. Trump says, I do pay internet tax, and I have done so for several years.\nSEE ALSO: I have drawn the Trump administration as Sonic the Hedgehog and I am ready to answer for it\nFor as long as I can remember, I have been paying my annual internet tax in the form of a personal check written out to the IRS. Each calendar year, I pull out my checkbook, write out a check for however many millions of dollars in internet tax I owe, put \"tax for internet\" in the memo and ship it first class in an envelope that says \"government\" on the front.\n\nThat's right, Mr. Trump. The joke is on you, because I have been sending internet tax to the federal government for YEARS. I do my part to help this country. Can you say the same?\nYou may be thinking, \"Jeff, what is internet tax and how do you calculate how much you owe?\" A good question, with a simple answer.\nInternet tax is a tax for the internet -- a contribution people make to continue using the world wide web. I learned about it on a weight lifting forum in 1999, back before anyone realized you could lie online. \nInternet tax is calculated pretty easily: each time you click the button on the mouse, you owe one dollar. Being a pretty prolific internet user, I pay an assistant $150,000 a year to live with me and count my clicks, and then I write out a check to the tax man. As you can see above, this year I clicked the mouse 28 million times. Yikes!\n\nMake no mistake: Internet tax is not the same thing as your internet bill. One is a bill, the other is a tax. They are different things. That being said, I would like to make it abundantly clear that if you have not been paying internet tax for as long as you have had the internet, you are breaking the law and will be arrested.\nOf course, if internet tax were as simple as I've made it out to be, we wouldn't all groan every time tax season rolls around, ha ha. Another more complicated part of the internet tax is that each year, about three weeks after sending the IRS your check, you will receive a call from the government informing you that they cannot accept your payment. They will tell you that you, \"Do not owe this money,\" and there \"Is not a tax on using the internet, it doesn't even make sense,\" and to \"Please stop wasting government time by sending these enormous sums of money to our office.\" Whenever that happens, I simply continue sending checks to the IRS until they cash them.\nMerely another element in the cat and mouse game of internet tax.\nYou know, sometimes, when I'm walking around in the big Amazon warehouse where I live with my whole extended family, I start to wonder if it's all worth it. Spending so much of my money, each and every year, on internet tax -- is the internet worth the trouble?\nThen, I open my computer and log onto Twitter dot com, and see another insanely bad tweet from the 45th President of the United States. And I think to myself: yes. It's all worth it.\nThanks for reading Mashable Humor: original comedy every day. Or most days. We're people, just like you, and we're trying our best.\n\nWATCH: Princess Charlotte and Prince George's balloon game reminds us of what childhood's really like"},"shares":{"facebook":1726,"twitter":255,"google_plus":5,"linked_in":619,"pinterest":1,"total":2606},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Du7CYCjVIpbgp0jsvS3W9wgQRjA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F521486%2Fe061975a-7537-42d1-8686-f03b324575d7.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6jDXW3U21K8U-rrRXPSFQSqwkGA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50063%2Fff001d43-1765-4f9c-95aa-ad986b6d162d.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pT1fq5sEglL9U8hhtstJTLmLPvE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50063%2Fff001d43-1765-4f9c-95aa-ad986b6d162d.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SiUJxk4BNAS_3DQvuSzr5HJ4pXA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50063%2Fff001d43-1765-4f9c-95aa-ad986b6d162d.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0eJ2olbK4PTYzr0DShn7NZNuHe8=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50063%2Fff001d43-1765-4f9c-95aa-ad986b6d162d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YYFVqKSLVzdw68WDchEWm-nLKtc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50063%2Fff001d43-1765-4f9c-95aa-ad986b6d162d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ttFBuC","display_title":"Internet tax is real and I have been paying it for years, by Jeff Bezos","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xa50qeM0Mg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Donald Trump accused my company of not paying \"internet tax.\" Wrong.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/culture/","tweet_text":"Internet tax is real and I have been paying it for years, by Jeff Bezos"}]
