If you are new to the Allegro game programming library and are looking for a place to start, well, you've hit the right place. Here, you'll find tutorials for the total beginner, assuming you have installed Allegro but have no idea how to really use it. Each tutorial will have the code fully explained in webpage format, as well as have the source available for download: so delve in!<br>      <br>      <strong>Note:</strong> Many of these tutorials were written with a version of Allegro that is much older than what is currently available. Therefore, when compiling these examples you may encounter warnings (and maybe even errors) about such functions like textprintf, which have now been upgraded to textprintf_ex. Consult the Allegro Manual for the newer versions of these functions that cause problems. </p>    <p><em>Please note that this code is not perfect!
