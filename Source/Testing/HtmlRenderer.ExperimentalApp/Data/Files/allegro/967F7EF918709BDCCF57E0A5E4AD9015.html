            &#8220;When I first hired Allegro, Carol asked me many questions about my lifestyle before we even began our
            design process. What type of entertaining, where were most meals taken, what rooms did kids use most, etc.
            With this insight, Allegro created an incredible living environment... quickly and within budget... My
            house is beautiful, inviting and yet <q>truly me.</q> I walk into my home and LOVE being there! She captured
            just what I had envisioned... ONLY BETTER!&#8221;

            &#8220;We bought our new home in September. We celebrated Christmas in our new DREAM HOME.. that very same
            year!! Our very first design project with Carol was 34 years ago, so we had no problem giving her <q>Carte
            Blanche</q> on our new home. Allegro incorporated all of our precious antiques into the new design plan. They
            reupholstered over 22 pieces of our furniture and helped us select all the other soft goods and case goods
            with trips to Dallas. Carol designed and Allegro fabricated custom window treatments and bedding throughout
            our home. Many imported French pieces were brought in, our existing artwork reframed, and  accessories, rugs
            and new artwork were included in the design process.  The week of our move, Allegro moved us from our old
            house into our new home. Allegro staff and trucks moved it all! They placed all furniture, hung all artwork,
            placed all rugs, lamps and accessories… down to florals and serving pieces!! We were truly HOME FOR THE
            HOLIDAYS!!!&#8221;
