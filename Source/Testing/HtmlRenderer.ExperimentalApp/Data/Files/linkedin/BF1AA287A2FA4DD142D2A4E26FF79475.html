        <p>In late 2002, Reid recruits a team of old colleagues from SocialNet and PayPal to work on a new idea. Six months later, LinkedIn launches. Growth is slow at first&#8212;as few as 20 signups on some days&#8212;but, by the fall, it shows enough promise to attract an investment from Sequoia Capital.</p>
