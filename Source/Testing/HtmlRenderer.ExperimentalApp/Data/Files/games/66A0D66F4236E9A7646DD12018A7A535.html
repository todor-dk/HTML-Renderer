		  Learning with Typing Games is fun and effective way to improve keyboarding skills. Various game genres (action, shooter, platformer, logic, racing etc.) motivate the whole classroom to develop their typing speed. The students will learn both hand eye coordination and muscle memory, two most important elements of touch typing.

                  <h3>How to Teach Keyboarding Skills </h3> 
				
                     <p>Free Typing Games has proven to be effective for learning how to quickly pick up a new skill. Students are challenged more and more at just the right times and rewarded upon completion. The idea of completing a challenge in exchange for a reward whether it is a certificate of completion or a name on the high score list is often enough to make the good experience for students. </p>				
					<h3>Gamified Learning with Keyboarding Games</h3>
					<p>An excellent way to make typing web lessons more fun is to turn each keyboarding lesson into a game by encouraging your students to type as fast as possible. A keyboarding game site helps students to practice their keyboarding skills by challenging them to work harder to reach each goal. A wpm test should be age appropriate and attainable for students based on their ability. For younger kids, try setting a timer for a period of 30 seconds and make the goal small so it is easy to accomplish.  For older children you can make the time period of the test to be at least a minute long. They key to encouraging students to participate is to offer positive feedback and give them several chances to try to beat their highest wpm.</p>
					<h3>Reaching the Goals</h3>
					<p>Children generally will feel some sort of accomplishment when they are able to reach goals. Younger kids will benefit from a simple sticker chart that shows their progress at the end of each class. Older children may like bar graphs or more formal charting.</p>
					<p>In conclusion, keyboarding classes do not have to be boring. You can make them fun by utilizing these tips. By doing so you will encourage kids to want to learn how to type and keyboarding will become the highlight of their week. Just remember to change up your lessons often as well as to offer continuous praise in order to for your students to successfully meet the goal of learning how to type proficiently.</p>
					<p>Kids are familiar with video gaming and over 90 per cent of school kids play them.  Keyboarding games tap into the interactive aspect of the way students learn that are the core of this process.  Through typing master games, students interact with the computer and their classmates to achieve both higher accuracy and speed.</p>
					
					<p>Keyboarding games allow kids to interact on both a personal and classroom level.  This happens by having goals that the student must meet or exceed.  On the classroom level, they might compete for prizes based on their performance or by beating a high score set by another student.</p>

										 

										 
									    <p>For younger students its also important to practice the correct rhythm. We now have a new music related <a href="http://www.typinggames.zone/dance-mat-typing-game">Dance Mat Typing Game</a> that generates simple variation of home row keys ( SDF JKL ) according to the selected song. Student can play the fun music game and practice rhythmic keyboarding even without thinking its learning process going on. For older kids and adults that want to type whole words we have <a href="http://www.typingtest.com/games/typing-attack/">the best online typing shooting game called Typing Attack.</a></p>				
										
					<h3>Keyboarding is a Core Skill</h3>					
<p>TypingMaster has made a keyboarding blog in addition to various keyboarding products for giving some ideas about keyboarding skills to teachers. TypingMaster also has arranged some webinars in web, in October 2014 webinar we had some great discussion and would like to feature the slides as well as some of the highlights of that day in the blog.</p>

<a href="http://www.typingblog.com" class="button" style="display: inline-block;">More information from typing blog</a> 

<p>For many students, learning touch type skills can be a frustrating task. It is not a suprise, considering there are so many new 
skills to learn at the same time: using all ten fingers, new finger movements, the idea of home keys, learning letter positions 
and typing without peeking at the keyboard.</p>

					<h4>Most Jobs Require Good Keyboarding Skills</h4>

<p>Most jobs nowadays require computer skills, even these jobs that years ago did not. In fact, many employers are even requiring candidates to be able to type properly at a reasonable minimum speed for productivity reasons. There are now even pre-employment typing test web sites for recruitment testing such as TypingTestPro.com. There are a variety of reasons that employers are looking for people with above average keyboarding skills. So there are real benefits that honing keyboard skills can give you. </p>
