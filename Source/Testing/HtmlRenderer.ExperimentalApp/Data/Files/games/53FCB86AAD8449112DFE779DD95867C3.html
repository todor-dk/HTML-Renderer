Bring your quirk, thoughts and heritage – everyone will respect your decisions and help you on your way to realise them.

We’ll review your application and if we like what we read, we’ll get in touch to organise a telephone interview or a work assessment (e.g. if you’re a budding Picasso we may ask you to design some artwork for a game). We’ll then invite you to a second interview, possibly over the phone again or maybe face-to-face. It’s a chance for you to find out as much about us as we find out about you. Assuming you’re impressed with us and vice-versa, you may have a couple more interviews before we make a decision, and then, hopefully, make you an offer you can’t refuse.","jobsAnswer_10":"Just get in touch with your contact in the recruitment team and they will help you to reschedule.","jobsAnswer_11":"Yes of course. A simple tip is to make sure you can demonstrate that you have addressed whatever it was that caused your previous application to be unsuccessful.","jobsAnswer_2":"Absolutely. English is the language we all work in at King, so you’ll need to be able to speak it confidently and write it well. If you can sing it well too, we might ask you to organise a karaoke event.","jobsAnswer_3":"Of course. There are people from over 60 countries at King. And if you need advice on relocation, all you need to do is speak to one of our magical recruiters.","jobsAnswer_4":"Just your CV and contact details.

It really does offer something magical for everyone, just like the games the studios based here help to create.","tour_berlin":"Based in the central borough of Berlin Mitte, ours is a backdrop that’s brimming with history. Culture vultures will find famous sites including Brandenburger Tor and Unter den Linden on our doorstep. The beautiful Tiergarten Park is just a short walk away, as is the infamous suburb of Kreuzberg with its vintage markets and vibrant night life - a must-see spot in this melting pot of a city.","tour_bucharest":"Famed for its cold winters and hot summers, Bucharest is the Romanian capital of media, arts and culture. It’s also home to our QA hub, where cutting-edge tech is used to build the testing tools of the future. Look out for stunning architecture of every style, from Bauhaus to Art Deco, and don’t miss soaking up some culture in the old town. Based in the famous Opera Centre, our office is a short walk to the beautiful botanical gardens and a short metro ride to the centre. Make you stay up late to experience our nightlife like a true local!","tour_chicago":"Chi-town is the Mecca of the Midwest. From the famous Art Institute, that you may have seen in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, to burger heavens such as Au Cheval. And if you’re passionate about sports, you’re definitely in the right city. Go watch a Cubs, White Sox or Chicago Bulls game. Feel the famous Chicago winds while taking a walk along the river.","tour_london":"Based in bustling Soho, the cultural-heart of the West End, our London office occupies all four floors of the landmark Ampersand building.

Also: it will never get below 10 degrees.","tour_malmo":"Opposite the central station at Bruksgatan 1, and just around the corner from Stortorget, our office is smack bang in the middle of Malmö’s centre and cultural heart.

It’s hard to get bored here. And if you do, you’ll probably make something creative out of it. New York is the melting pot of the universe. Do tourist stuff in Times Square, upgrade your style in Soho or take a day trip to Coney Island. This city is for everyone.","tour_sanfrancisco":"With its mild climate, stunning scenery and cosmopolitan character, San Francisco is one of North Americas most beautiful and exciting cities. You’ll find our studio within striking distance of the famous AT&T stadium – home to the SF Giants – and pleasantly close to the water and all its activities. It’s also just a tram ride away from the heart of the city where history, culture, world cuisine and, of course the Golden Gate Bridge await you.","tour_seattle":"Surrounded by ocean, mountains and evergreen forests, Seattle is known across the world as the ‘emerald city’.

Here, the team build epic, F2P games with great stories, great characters and even greater gameplay. And despite the rumours, it’s really not that rainy. Seattle usually receives less rainfall than New York and Chicago. Usually.","tour_stockholm":"The location of our first studio, Stockholm holds a special place in King’s heart. Built over 14 islands, it’s one of the world’s most unique and beautiful capital cities. And when you live and work with us, it’s yours to explore!

Closer to home, you can try local delicacies like sushi, tempura and noodles. In Tokyo, it’d be a crime not to.","tour_valletta":"With more hours of sunshine than most of Europe, there’s plenty of fun to be had outside of office hours in Malta. When they’re not crunching numbers, the team based here make full use of the pristine beaches and vibrant waterfront scene on their doorstep.
