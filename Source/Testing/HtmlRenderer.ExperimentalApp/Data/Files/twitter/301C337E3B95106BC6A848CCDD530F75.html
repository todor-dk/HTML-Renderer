But this time, the president's tweetstorm included one notable addition: a jab at his former campaign opponent's daughter, Chelsea Clinton.\nSEE ALSO: Why is everybody so worked up about Donald Trump's Twitter account?\nIt all started when Trump received some backlash after the president's daughter, Ivanka — you know, the woman who claims she tries to \"stay out of politics\" — sat in for her father at a session at the G20 summit on Saturday. The internet was not particularly pleased with Ivanka's appearance, and people began questioning what qualifies her to represent the country while conferring with world leaders.\nThis morning, Trump attempted to defend his decision to ask Ivanka to \"hold [his] seat,\" first noting that German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed seat-holding was \"standard.\" \nWhen I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\nThen Trump imagined how the media would have covered the incident had Hillary Clinton been the one who had asked her daughter to sit in during a meeting. \nIf Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother,as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\nIn the tweet, which included another attack on the \"dishonest media,\" Trump claimed that had Chelsea Clinton sat in for her mother while she \"gave our country away\" the \"Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!\" rather than criticizing the family.\nClinton quickly responded to the president's tweet, coming to the defense of both of her parents and throwing some shade in the process.\nGood morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not. https://t.co/4ODjWZUp0c— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) July 10, 2017\n\nThough Trump is no stranger to early morning Twitter rants, this particular tirade did seem to be especially broad and there's no denying the timing is certainly convenient. \nSince Trump seems to have mastered the art of distractions, one can't help but wonder if he's simply stirring up some social media trouble to draw attention away from reports that his son, Donald Trump Jr., met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 election in hopes of obtaining information on Hillary Clinton.\nDonald Trump Jr., who has been noticeably active on Twitter lately himself, also weighed in on the Ivanka controversy, asking those \"outraged\" by the sit-in if they'd prefer him to sub in for his father instead.\nIf the left is so \"outraged\" about Ivanka sitting in for a few minutes, maybe they'd be happier if I sub in for a while???

But, one former British Vogue editor just lifted the lid on what it's really like to work at Vogue. And, her account reads much like something out of The Devil Wears Prada. \nSEE ALSO: Vogue got trolled over Kendall and Gigi 3 times in 24 hours, didn't learn its lesson\nLucinda Chambers worked at British Vogue for 36 years, 25 of which were served as fashion director, but left the magazine in May 2017. For the first time since her departure, she has spoken out in a scathing interview about what really went down. The candid interview was published on fashion blog Vestoj, but subsequently taken down. A cached version of the interview was being circulated on Twitter, but some time Tuesday morning the blog put it back on the site with an editor's note.\nAt the time of Chambers' departure, British Vogue published an article announcing Chambers would \"step down\". But, Chambers' version of what happened doesn't quite tally up with this. \n\"A month and a half ago I was fired from Vogue. It took them three minutes to do it. No one in the building knew it was going to happen,\" begins the interview with Chambers. \n\"The management and the editor I’ve worked with for twenty-five years had no idea. Nor did HR. Even the chairman told me he didn’t know it was going to happen. No one knew, except the man who did it – the new editor [Edward Enninful],\" she claims. \nWhen contacted by Mashable, a spokesperson for Vogue said: \"It's usual for an incoming Editor to make some changes to the team.\"\n\"Any changes made are done with the full knowledge of senior management,\" the statement continued. The spokesperson declined to make any further comment on Chambers' interview. \n\"There are very few fashion magazines that make you feel empowered.\"\nBut, Chambers' honesty didn't end there. Oh, hell no. Chambers admitted that she hasn't read Vogue \"in years\" and that fashion magazines have \"lost the authority they once had\" and are no longer \"useful\".\n\"There are very few fashion magazines that make you feel empowered. Most leave you totally anxiety-ridden, for not having the right kind of dinner party, setting the table in the right kind of way or meeting the right kind of people. Truth be told, I haven’t read Vogue in years,\" she said. \nChambers said that the clothes featured in Vogue are \"just irrelevant for most people\" because they are \"so ridiculously expensive\". She also spoke about the impact of working in fashion on one's mental health. \n\"You’re not allowed to fail in fashion – especially in this age of social media, when everything is about leading a successful, amazing life. Nobody today is allowed to fail, instead the prospect causes anxiety and terror,\" she said. \nPeople have taken to Twitter to praise Chambers for her candour and bravery. \nEndless respect for Lucinda Chambers - both before and after her astonishingly candid interview about leaving Vogue https://t.co/t32Y12cW5w— Hattie Crisell (@hattiehattie) July 3, 2017\n\nA fucking great interview with Vogue's fashion director Lucinda Chambers on being fired, failure, nurturing, anxiety https://t.co/wO3QPtblpu— Laura Snapes (@laurasnapes) July 3, 2017\n\nLucinda Chambers walking out of Vogue on her last day like pic.twitter.com/hqkDnon7Xq— Otegha K.

But this time, the president's tweetstorm included one notable addition: a jab at his former campaign opponent's daughter, Chelsea Clinton.\nSEE ALSO: Why is everybody so worked up about Donald Trump's Twitter account?\nIt all started when Trump received some backlash after the president's daughter, Ivanka — you know, the woman who claims she tries to \"stay out of politics\" — sat in for her father at a session at the G20 summit on Saturday. The internet was not particularly pleased with Ivanka's appearance, and people began questioning what qualifies her to represent the country while conferring with world leaders.\nThis morning, Trump attempted to defend his decision to ask Ivanka to \"hold [his] seat,\" first noting that German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed seat-holding was \"standard.\" \nWhen I left Conference Room for short meetings with Japan and other countries, I asked Ivanka to hold seat. Very standard. Angela M agrees!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\nThen Trump imagined how the media would have covered the incident had Hillary Clinton been the one who had asked her daughter to sit in during a meeting. \nIf Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother,as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017\n\nIn the tweet, which included another attack on the \"dishonest media,\" Trump claimed that had Chelsea Clinton sat in for her mother while she \"gave our country away\" the \"Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!\" rather than criticizing the family.\nClinton quickly responded to the president's tweet, coming to the defense of both of her parents and throwing some shade in the process.\nGood morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not. https://t.co/4ODjWZUp0c— Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) July 10, 2017\n\nThough Trump is no stranger to early morning Twitter rants, this particular tirade did seem to be especially broad and there's no denying the timing is certainly convenient. \nSince Trump seems to have mastered the art of distractions, one can't help but wonder if he's simply stirring up some social media trouble to draw attention away from reports that his son, Donald Trump Jr., met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 election in hopes of obtaining information on Hillary Clinton.\nDonald Trump Jr., who has been noticeably active on Twitter lately himself, also weighed in on the Ivanka controversy, asking those \"outraged\" by the sit-in if they'd prefer him to sub in for his father instead.\nIf the left is so \"outraged\" about Ivanka sitting in for a few minutes, maybe they'd be happier if I sub in for a while???

But, one former British Vogue editor just lifted the lid on what it's really like to work at Vogue. And, her account reads much like something out of The Devil Wears Prada. \nSEE ALSO: Vogue got trolled over Kendall and Gigi 3 times in 24 hours, didn't learn its lesson\nLucinda Chambers worked at British Vogue for 36 years, 25 of which were served as fashion director, but left the magazine in May 2017. For the first time since her departure, she has spoken out in a scathing interview about what really went down. The candid interview was published on fashion blog Vestoj, but subsequently taken down. A cached version of the interview was being circulated on Twitter, but some time Tuesday morning the blog put it back on the site with an editor's note.\nAt the time of Chambers' departure, British Vogue published an article announcing Chambers would \"step down\". But, Chambers' version of what happened doesn't quite tally up with this. \n\"A month and a half ago I was fired from Vogue. It took them three minutes to do it. No one in the building knew it was going to happen,\" begins the interview with Chambers. \n\"The management and the editor I’ve worked with for twenty-five years had no idea. Nor did HR. Even the chairman told me he didn’t know it was going to happen. No one knew, except the man who did it – the new editor [Edward Enninful],\" she claims. \nWhen contacted by Mashable, a spokesperson for Vogue said: \"It's usual for an incoming Editor to make some changes to the team.\"\n\"Any changes made are done with the full knowledge of senior management,\" the statement continued. The spokesperson declined to make any further comment on Chambers' interview. \n\"There are very few fashion magazines that make you feel empowered.\"\nBut, Chambers' honesty didn't end there. Oh, hell no. Chambers admitted that she hasn't read Vogue \"in years\" and that fashion magazines have \"lost the authority they once had\" and are no longer \"useful\".\n\"There are very few fashion magazines that make you feel empowered.

Nobody today is allowed to fail, instead the prospect causes anxiety and terror,\" she said. \nPeople have taken to Twitter to praise Chambers for her candour and bravery. \nEndless respect for Lucinda Chambers - both before and after her astonishingly candid interview about leaving Vogue https://t.co/t32Y12cW5w— Hattie Crisell (@hattiehattie) July 3, 2017\n\nA fucking great interview with Vogue's fashion director Lucinda Chambers on being fired, failure, nurturing, anxiety https://t.co/wO3QPtblpu— Laura Snapes (@laurasnapes) July 3, 2017\n\nLucinda Chambers walking out of Vogue on her last day like pic.twitter.com/hqkDnon7Xq— Otegha K.

The pair, who have an infant daughter, are again fighting in public, this time over accusations involving infidelity and betrayal. \nWhile nonconsensual porn is terrible no matter who shares it, Kardashian bears a higher level of responsibility given that he used his fame and social media megaphone to exact revenge. By posting the private images, Kardashian endorsed the practice of shaming a woman for her sexuality.\nHe already owes Chyna an apology for his social media abuse, but the public deserves one too. \n\nSEE ALSO: 4 things you should do when you're the victim of revenge porn\nThe saga began when Kardashian posted a series of explicit images that he appeared to have taken, or Chyna sent to him, on Instagram. When his account was disabled, presumably for violating the platform's terms of service, he turned to Twitter. Within about 30 minutes, Twitter had removed the nude images of Chyna that Kardashian shared, though his account remains active. \n\nWhile Kardashian can still reach his 7.4 million Twitter followers, he may land in jail for the juvenile outburst. Nonconsensual porn or \"revenge porn\" is illegal in California and can be punishable by jail time and a fine, though not all states have similar laws. In California, images or recordings of intimate body parts meant to stay private cannot be distributed with the intent to cause emotional distress, according to the law. If the victim is indeed psychologically harmed, the perpetrator may be guilty of a misdemeanor.\nYou might think that violating the companies' terms of service, doing something potentially illegal, and terrorizing someone you once loved in front of an audience of millions could convince Kardashian to take a deep breath and step back from social media. But his string of text-only tweets documenting Chyna's alleged betrayals suggests he thought only of channelling his rage and disappointment. \n\"But she couldn't remain loyal and cheated and f**ked way too many people and she got caught and now this is all happening and it's sad,\" Kardashian wrote on Twitter. \n.@robkardashian It's not okay to share nude images of someone without their consent, no matter how upset you are with them.— End Revenge Porn (@EndRevengePorn) July 5, 2017\n\nSo in case it wasn't clear already: Don't be like Rob Kardashian. Don't use your heartbreak to justify emotional terror. If you feel manipulated by a partner, think of a more productive way to address that pain than resorting to the age-old misogyny of calling her a slut in the public square. Therapy, anger management -- even a long walk in the woods could help. \nNeither Instagram or Twitter would comment on Kardashian's individual account. \"We want to maintain a safe and supportive environment on Instagram, and we work quickly to remove reported content that violates our community guidelines,\" a spokesperson for Instagram said. \nI will always stand for a woman's right to control images of her own body. Doesn't matter who she is or what she has done in the past. https://t.co/TXIM3wleB5— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nTwo high-profile lawyers who specialize in nonconsensual porn cases both tweeted about Kardashian's posts. Carrie Goldberg, founder of the firm C.A. Goldberg, told People that Kardashian faces an uphill legal battle.\n“This is sort of the classic, quintessential revenge porn,” she said. “Rob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim’s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex.”\nLisa Bloom, of The Bloom Firm, linked to coverage of Kardashian's tweets and wrote, \"Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick.\" \nRevenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong, a form of domestic partner violence, and a violation of social media's terms of use. And truly sick. https://t.co/dkLlVHcUmM— Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 5, 2017\n\nBut you shouldn't need lawyers to convince you of why nonconsensual porn is so devastating. There are countless first-person accounts, many from women who won't share their last name on dates, never know what prospective employers will find out about them in a Google search, and who are even stalked and harassed by strangers who saw their picture and personal information on the internet. If such a threat doesn't seem real, just pick up a recent issue of Time, which documented those experiences in horrifying detail. \nDespite the work of victims and advocates to raise awareness of nonconsensual porn, Kardashian's cruel tantrum arguably just gave people in possession of intimate images an excuse to feel satisfied — vindicated, even — in making those pictures public. \nFor that he owes everyone a sincere apology -- at the very least.\nWATCH: This giant kinetic sculpture is actually a shape-shifting human face"},"shares":{"twitter":509,"facebook":2172,"linked_in":58,"google_plus":6,"total":2745},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/r1g4DAR4fKcVD_oSHvUMEKluKPA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5FRy5J5TMN8WCDWwX-lk-ePb26Q=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xcrg_JcL-Cty3nNlKKQZ68FHMTA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nXTPIhdSWS_2_90LdOM57cS3A8s=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ASm4dWhfq_oMcwvCSP7lTIbstDY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7xHb0bH1js0LxYI6pm0pDr7L74U=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50611%2F5deae323-ec6e-4818-96c6-2ae53ae260e1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2uLHCPg","display_title":"Rob Kardashian owes Blac Chyna, and all of us, an apology","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gb0eOzPlLd","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"What Kardashian did is awful.

Twitter cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey's time is also divided since he also serves as CEO of payments company Square.\nSegal's qualifications as a banker seem legit. He most recently served as senior vice president of finance at Intuit, a publicly-traded company that has a market capitalization of nearly $34 billion. That's nearly three times the size of Twitter, which has been valued between $13 and $14 billion. \nPrior to that role, Segal worked as CFO of the RPX Corporation from 2013 to 2015. He worked in banking at Goldman Sachs from 1996 to 2013. Noto also worked at Goldman Sachs during that time, leaving in 2008 to serve as CFO for the National Football League.\nClearly, Segal knows banking and has years of experience working for a Silicon Valley tech company. And, according to a tweet that he shared on Tuesday, he's pumped for the role:\nBelieve @Twitter has an important mission and tremendous potential; can’t wait to work w/ @jack and the awesome leadership team!— Ned Segal (@nedsegal) July 11, 2017\n\nInterestingly, Segal seemingly isn't that active on the platform — at least when it comes to sending his own tweets (which is not unlike other hires and board members at Twitter who also personally use Twitter sparsely). As of Tuesday, he had only sent 19 tweets from his account, two of which were him being excited about joining Twitter. \nA lack of tweeting does not mean Segal does not use Twitter. We all see tweets embedded online and flashed across television screens, of course.\nAs CFO, Segal will be tasked with convincing Wall Street investors and analysts — Twitter's worse enemy as, over the years, they watched user growth and advertiser interest stagnate and even dwindle — of the company's value. \nAnother disappointment to investors: Twitter was the talk of an acquisition by Google, Salesforce, or Disney last year, but nothing came to fruition. \nDorsey and Noto have promised that the independent company is on a path to profitability this year. Twitter laid off hundreds of employees and shattered businesses, like the 6-second app Vine, last year. \n\"He brings a principled, engaging and rigorous approach to the CFO role, with a track record of driving profitable growth,\" Dorsey said in a statement, according to CNBC.\nTwitter's stock rose in 3 percent in after-hours trading Tuesday but fell back to below 1 percent soon after. \nWhile Segal does fit the white male narrative typical of Silicon Valley and of Twitter, the company did hire a new head of diversity and inclusion. Candi Castleberry-Singleton started earlier this month, replacing Jeffrey Siminoff who had stepped down in February. \nAs typical across tech companies but vocally opposed by diversity advocates, Castleberry-Singleton is ranked as a vice president and not in the C-suite. \nTwitter has brought in other leadership to steer the company forward. Cofounder Biz Stone, praised internally for his energy, returned last month to focus on the company's culture. \nWATCH: 11 facts you didn't know about Twitter"},"shares":{"facebook":75,"linked_in":9,"twitter":291,"google_plus":6,"total":381},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/66xAKdioeEPfYcGFK11dws46Zrc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F533026%2F8e01843a-7f52-4cd5-a9e1-2ace339e09f0.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dpn4nHkEVDwcMzhFMJDdgL-M7iA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51118%2Fa1f3e9e2-d3bb-4d82-8155-396519abec13.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B-kY_VN3XJofRWqxWms3_60SoVY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51118%2Fa1f3e9e2-d3bb-4d82-8155-396519abec13.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Wn4XmPvX8119osPW2qMglC7v8xc=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51118%2Fa1f3e9e2-d3bb-4d82-8155-396519abec13.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RQ-JnCxunWIwC6AQjIaEeuiyOE0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51118%2Fa1f3e9e2-d3bb-4d82-8155-396519abec13.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LA7M6y2F82acEgiPK2pkn8CBfT4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51118%2Fa1f3e9e2-d3bb-4d82-8155-396519abec13.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2vaf6qS","display_title":"Twitter hires a former Goldman Sachs banker to serve as CFO","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"z63nwW5n5E","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The social network is on a quest to be profitable.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Twitter hires a former Goldman Sachs banker to serve as CFO"},{"_id":"596534b6f11b2c08d4000190","id":"2017/07/11/twitter-blocked-trump-lawsuit-free-speech","title":"So a bunch of Twitter users actually sued Trump for blocking them","title_tag":null,"author":"Sasha Lekach","post_date":"2017-07-11T20:27:33+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 20:27:33 +0000","formatted_date":" 20 hours ago","formatted_shares":"392","sort_key":"1Dv2Z7","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/twitter-blocked-trump-lawsuit-free-speech/","content":{"plain":"Twitter users blocked by President Donald Trump weren't just threatening legal action if the president didn't unblock them on the social media platform -- they followed through. \nSEE ALSO: Trump blocked users on Twitter and now they're threatening legal action\nThe seven users through the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Trump for blocking them. They were cut from his feed because they criticized the president and his policies on the platform. \nThe federal lawsuit claims Trump's blocks essentially silences his opponents, infringing on their First Amendment rights and keeps them from interacting in a public forum. Along with Trump, White House press secretary Sean Spicer and White House social media director Dan Scavino are named in the suit.\nFirst amendment lawyers wrote a letter to Trump and his social media and communications team last month demanding the president unblock the users. When that didn't happen, the lawsuit was filed in a New York district court.\nIn the suit, all seven users from across the U.S. claim they were blocked in the past few months for comments, replies, and other tweets criticizing or mocking the president on Twitter.\nWell now Trump blocked me so you'll have to use your imagination pic.twitter.com/kNSaXD0Abr— Philip N Cohen (@familyunequal) June 7, 2017\n\nThe group suing includes Rebecca Buckwalter, a writer and political consultant in D.C.; Philip Cohen in Maryland, who is a sociology professor at the University of Maryland; Holly Figueroa from Washington, who is a political organizer; Eugene Gu in Nashville, who is a surgery resident; Brandon Neely, a police officer in Texas; Joseph Papp in Pennsylvania, who is a former pro cyclist; and NYC-based Nicholas Pappas, who is a comic and writer. \nTo get a sense of what earned these users a block from the president, here are the offending tweets:\nTo be fair you didn't win the WH: Russia won it for you. pic.twitter.com/iPUXKopd9B— RebeccaBuckwalterPoz (@rpbp) June 6, 2017\n\n pic.twitter.com/MJsih1xdMZ— Philip N Cohen (@familyunequal) June 7, 2017\n\nThis is pretty much how the whole world sees you.#AMJoy#SundayMorning pic.twitter.com/CycqYnKg8b— Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 28, 2017\n\nCovfefe: The same guy who doesn't proofread his Twitter handles the nuclear button.— Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) June 18, 2017\n\nCongrats and now black lung won't be covered under #TrumpCare— Brandon Neely (@BrandonTXNeely) June 12, 2017\n\nWhy didn't you attend your #PittsburghNotParis  rally in DC, Sir? #fakeleader— Joe Papp (@joepabike) June 3, 2017\n\nTrump is right. The government should protect the people.That's why the courts are protecting us from him.— Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) June 5, 2017\n\n\"The White House acts unlawfully when it excludes people from this forum simply because they’ve disagreed with the president,\" Knight Institute executive director Jameel Jaffer said in a release about the lawsuit.\nLike the original letter, the suit asks for the White House to unblock the users and concede that restricting users based on their viewpoints is unconstitutional.\nWe've reached out to the White House for comment. A Twitter spokesperson said the company didn't have anything to say about the lawsuit.\nTrump has 33.7 million Twitter followers. These seven weren't tweeting #MAGA, but that doesn't mean they can't be part of the conversation, they claimed. \nWATCH: Master the game of ping pong with this robot"},"shares":{"google_plus":3,"facebook":92,"twitter":287,"linked_in":10,"total":392},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YJO05XSHNmQOs7872YNndALzZqw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F533019%2F7f9b93b0-cf00-4648-a0fe-a187117d01c6.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/10_1R14Y7m4jXV3fATqL5BPi0zs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51104%2Fd800cc7b-ee7a-421b-b2c2-293f06bf3d0c.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bUXES46obRCDOdiDSUy4igqjGJA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51104%2Fd800cc7b-ee7a-421b-b2c2-293f06bf3d0c.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/huHKsV4VUmDJ0_NhRjqycxp01LE=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51104%2Fd800cc7b-ee7a-421b-b2c2-293f06bf3d0c.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/EbVPmsBsvorJw7W6D-cEbjlGbIM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51104%2Fd800cc7b-ee7a-421b-b2c2-293f06bf3d0c.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ph1g3roWA3m4LSP-oyw_uaKTtYc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51104%2Fd800cc7b-ee7a-421b-b2c2-293f06bf3d0c.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sMVYyl","display_title":"So a bunch of Twitter users actually sued Trump for blocking them","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5EKnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"You're blocked!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"So a bunch of Twitter users actually sued Trump for blocking them"},{"_id":"59650e221535dd0d3f00001c","id":"2017/07/11/michael-jackson-animated-halloween-special","title":"Michael Jackson is getting a new animated Halloween special","title_tag":null,"author":"Nicole Gallucci","post_date":"2017-07-11T17:42:57+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 17:42:57 +0000","formatted_date":" 23 hours ago","formatted_shares":"292","sort_key":"1DuZA7","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/michael-jackson-animated-halloween-special/","content":{"plain":"Michael Jackson — you know, the King of Pop and Halloween — is getting his own animated television special to celebrate the spooky season this Fall.\nSEE ALSO: Paris Jackson defends her love of nudity with a declarative Instagram post\nAccording to Jackson's official Twitter account, the legendary singer who died in June 2009 will be honored with an animated television special this fall, titled, Michael Jackson’s Halloween.\nThere’s a new animated special coming to TV this fall – Michael Jackson’s Halloween.
