By paying closer attention to the data and machine learning used to build those AIs.\nGoogle's new initiative, PAIR, or People + AI Research, unveiled on Monday, seeks to put human considerations like this at the front of AI development.\nSEE ALSO: How the scary potential of AI brought tech competitors together\nIn a blog post on PAIR, senior staff research scientists from the Google Brain team, Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, write, \"By building AI systems with users in mind from the ground up, we open up entire new areas of design and interaction.\"\nThe team believes part of the solution for how to build AI systems that consider actual human needs is to treat AI less as a collection of algorithms that you can apply to various problems and more as a design material or medium like paint. They also want to pair that perspective with tools and training that help those building AI and machine learning systems view it and develop for it in a more people-centric way.\nTo help guide AI development, the team will focus on three areas: Tools for AI engineers and researchers, how they can build tools to help people working in verticals like healthcare, farming and music effectively apply AI, and the inclusivity of AI systems.\nIt's that last part that may resonate with people inside and outside of Google.\nPAIR is not Google's first \"let's get a handle on AI\" effort. The tech giant is a founding member of the  Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (\"Partnership on AI\" for short). Both groups recognize that the key to unbiased AI is better training data (Machine Learning systems are typically trained with mountains of example data to build artificial intelligence around things like object and face recognition, speech translation, and even cancer research).\nLast year, Partnership for AI founding member and Microsoft Research Technical Fellow and Managing Director Eric Horvitz told me, \"Bias in data can get propagated to machine learning that can lead to biased systems.” He also worried that biased AI could impact, “how racial minorities are handled when it comes to visual perception and facial recognition.”\nWhile Google acknowledges that Partnership on AI and PAIR are complementary efforts, the two are not directly tied together. Even so, a key component of PAIR is the open-sourcing of two Google visual tools, Facets Overview and Facets Drive. Both deal with training data.\n\"We think this is important because training data is a key ingredient in modern AI systems, but it can often be a source of opacity and confusion. Indeed, one of the ways that ML engineering seems different than traditional software engineering is a stronger need to debug not just code, but data too,\" wrote the Google Brain Team.\nIt's not just the AI world at large that has work to do on AI data and output. In April, researchers at  University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Princeton University found gender-based bias in numerous AI systems, including Google Translate where it automatically \"converts gender-neutral pronouns from several languages into 'he' when talking about a doctor, and 'she' when talking about a nurse.\"\nGoogle never explicitly mentions \"bias\" in its PAIR announcement, but it's clear that the company wants to use early human input to make AI output a little less artificial. \nWATCH: AI Robot can teach people how to play tennis"},"shares":{"facebook":100,"twitter":332,"google_plus":18,"linked_in":170,"stumble_upon":829,"total":1449},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-9pqsQQA-8omVTH4Q1N8sBCJXeA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530962%2F5472dbf7-1dfe-4de6-9cd8-e32436b4fd5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FTQ0ZlpgjRa9BM3FgWiuUvSwiyQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FQSNbT5htRNlAlWR0AP-edocENw=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Nu4fTVopzP4KO8bMsp4meFgFJ28=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sWM3KK","display_title":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Adbl3LXo3q","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Taking artificial out of AI.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems"},{"_id":"595b6812f11b2c72ce001f13","id":"2017/07/04/nasdaq-error-123-47","title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2017-07-04T10:02:26+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 10:02:26 +0000","formatted_date":"07/04/2017","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1DsGtG","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/04/nasdaq-error-123-47/","content":{"plain":"For one moment on Monday afternoon, the prices of several stocks on Nasdaq -- including those of Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, and Microsoft -- were all priced exactly the same, $123.47.\nObviously, this couldn't be correct; it would mean a sudden, massive drop in value for Amazon and Google and a huge increase in value for Microsoft and eBay. If it were true, Google's market cap would fall from $623 billion to about $83 billion, while Microsoft's market cap would be propelled to nearly $1 trillion. \nSEE ALSO: New York Times is using Google’s AI to expand online comments\nThe odd occurrence was caused by a data glitch, the Financial Times reported late Monday, that affected only some of the stocks listed on Nasdaq. While the stock prices remained unaltered on Nasdaq itself, third-party services such as Google Finance and Bloomberg displayed the erroneous $123.47 price for a while.  \nStock market API erroneously publishing 123.47 stock quotes for Amazon, eBay, Apple, MSFT and others. #infosec #nyse #nasdaq pic.twitter.com/jK2FG3E1VR— Robb Ware (@robbware) July 4, 2017\n\nAccording to a statement from Nasdaq, the error occurred after \"certain third parties improperly propagated test data that was distributed as part of the normal evening test procedures.\"\nWhile temporary, the glitch was scary, and reminiscent of the 2010 flash crash, in which major U.S. stock indexes, including Nasdaq, collapsed within minutes, erasing trillions of dollars of value before quickly rebounding. That, however, was a far more dangerous occurrence, as the stock prices really did plummet due to a combination of market manipulations and automated high-frequency trading tools which initiated a selling frenzy. \nMonday's glitch was different. Despite sporadic claims of some trades being made at the $123.47 price, Nasdaq told the FT that it did not affect market trading. The biggest consequences appear to be a bit of confusion among traders and a fun day for companies like Sears and Zynga, who saw their stock prices suddenly jump by a few thousand percent. \nWATCH: The future of selfies is this camera drone with facial recognition"},"shares":{"linked_in":513,"twitter":381,"google_plus":10,"facebook":227,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HD5cr-AeSEj3-VYrtBbyxGY5anY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F526213%2F7ca4c779-f75b-4336-b871-a7f8979fa0fc.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ilyz0EZDCaA2B75IRrVGUlkptVs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vvG96ZxowxKSyYSxD6UXtnz8TFE=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nEHZgvvn-Km5J8YuAk3nm_6EjW0=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ukMNq5","display_title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"R6k01Z9nVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"An odd glitch Monday caused the stock prices of several companies listed on Nasdaq to be exactly the same: $123.47.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday"},{"_id":"595fbbb9f11b2c2a2a000a61","id":"2017/07/07/google-ai-journalism-funding-europe","title":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-07-07T16:49:45+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 16:49:45 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"751","sort_key":"1Dtygo","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/google-ai-journalism-funding-europe/","content":{"plain":"Human journalists, start the countdown to your obsolescence (if you haven't already, that is). Your inevitable robot replacements are picking up steam -- and more importantly, sponsorship -- with another show of support from the world's biggest tech company. \nGoogle's Digital News Initiative (DNI), a fund that promotes innovation in digital journalism in Europe, just announced its latest round of sponsored projects. Among them is RADAR, a collaboration between the UK and Ireland's Press Association (PA) and Urbs Media, a startup that creates localized news stories using AI.     \nDNI awarded the RADAR project (which stands for Reporters And Data And Robots, natch) a €706,000 (roughly $804,000) grant. That influx of cash will be used to create a service that will ramp up automated news efforts, with natural language generation (NLG) AI programs pumping out up to 30,000 stories per month across localized distribution networks starting in 2018. All the components of the AI-created stories will be automated, from the words on the screen to the graphics and images that accompany them.\nTo start, the AI will be tasked with producing low-level stories from templates created by human writers. These types of stories are important, but not incredibly labor intensive -- think sports recaps and earnings reports -- and even a human writer would be filling in the blanks with the necessary data to create them, not using actual brain power for analysis, like what I'm doing right now. Journalists, like just about every type of professional, have some thankless, easily repeatable responsibilities. That's where the AI comes in, at least to start. \nSEE ALSO: Will a robot take your job? This website provides an answer (that you probably won't like)\nDue to the humdrum nature of the AI-produced stories, human writers and editors have no cause for concern about being replaced by robots, at least according to PA's Editor-in-Chief Peter Clifton, who called RADAR a \"fantastic step forward for PA,\" in a release announcing the DNI sponsorship. “Skilled human journalists will still be vital in the process, but RADAR allows us to harness artificial intelligence to scale up to a volume of local stories that would be impossible to provide manually,” he said. \nThe project will require a team of five people to \"identify, template, and edit data-driven stories,\" about topics like crime, health, and employment, so humans aren't eliminated from the equation completely -- but under more traditional circumstances a five-person squad could never wrangle the full load of 30,000 stories per month. There's also something to be said about how young writers might cut their teeth on the lowest levels of the copy desk, learning how to produce clean, accurate copy and absorbing the massive amounts of information they transcribe, which could provide context for bigger stories in the future. AI reporting could eliminate that essential experience.  \nThe DNI funding will also be used to create databases to for the AI to pull from, harnessing repositories of data from wider public databases in the UK like the National Health Service (NHS).  \nWhile this is just the latest example of AI journalism sweeping the digital media industry, it's not a new trend, by any means. Wordsmith, an NLG AI program, has been producing automated stories for the U.S.'s Associated Press (AP) since 2014, and other traditional outlets like the New York Times and Los Angeles Times have used automation for low-level reporting.\nYou might have even used AI to create your own content.

Siri is an abomination, and even Alexa can’t answer some of the most basic questions that I ask. Luckily for me, Google Assistant has gotten ridiculously smart in the past year, and it's legitimately changed my life since I've started using it.\nSEE ALSO: Hey, Siri, Google Assistant is coming to the iPhone — and it's getting smarter\nGoogle Assistant wasn't always great, and it wasn't even widely available until recently. When the search giant launched its artificially intelligent assistant back in May 2016, it was exclusively available for the company's own Pixel phone. \nGoogle didn’t even give other Android phone makers like Samsung and LG access to the app. If you didn't have a Pixel phone, you were simply out of luck.\nBut things finally changed for the better about a month ago. This May at Google I/O, the company finally announced it was releasing the app on Android’s chief rival, iOS. \nSafe to say most iPhone fans didn’t notice or hated the experience. Our very own reporter Karissa Bell detailed the ridiculous issues she faced when using the app shortly after launch. Even my first few experiences testing the app were grim -- but I vowed to check back in every week or so to see if I could find new uses for it. What I've learned in the ensuing month is that Google Assistant for iOS is practically the only app I need.\nGoogle Assistant has straight up improved my quality of life. The first time I discovered just how useful it could be, I was riding my bike. It was pretty late, and I may or may not have had some adult beverages, and I was trying to navigate an unfamiliar part of Brooklyn. I remember belligerently opening the app and asking, \"How do i get home?\"\nThe app heroically pulled up directions to my apartment across town, and with the push of a button, it launched Google Maps, and I was soon biking in the right direction, safely in my own bike lane. Phew. Huge save by the assistant.\nSEE ALSO: Google's likely ditching HTC for LG when it comes to the next Pixel\nThen it saved me in a pinch again. The second time it was earlier in the morning, and I was running behind schedule as I got ready. I asked my phone what was on my calendar, and pulled up a preview of my events with -- crucially -- with the locations of each of the events.\nOne of the events happened to be a fancier outing for my gaudy friend who was throwing himself a birthday. The evening was starting at a hotel bar. Woof. Not only was I surprised, I had to change and basically revaluate my plans for the day. No bag. No sneakers. Another crucial save chalked up to Google Assistant.\nThat's when I was sold.\nThe reality is that these apps are made for people who are completely disorganized, overwhelmed with the realities of being an adult, and need constant prodding to stay on course. They're for weaklings -- and unfortunately, I fall right into that target demographic. I can't say it's the best looking or most fun app that I use, but it's finally starting to work exactly as its designers intended. It helps me course-correct, and for that reason, it's my new favorite app on the iPhone.\nWATCH: This Japanese home assistant is a holographic girl that lives in a jar"},"shares":{"facebook":276,"google_plus":14,"linked_in":42,"twitter":376,"total":708},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8iL6EEX1nl_Uos-Ps4ZgaWMFSYw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528698%2Ffe5cd430-3ea8-429b-b19f-fb134bb42f92.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6BzGVUUn0cFyAmmggiUUjmXhPyY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7ev-yPN0qiglUQr_s2vBRFHMaAg=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pacc2BDCxhoAx9Q5zH28dyRb9fo=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tTFqbd","display_title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"OBlPB920Xe","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Google Assistant is my co-pilot.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life"}]

The upcoming flagship will sport the same \"squeezeable\" frame technology as HTC's new U 11, according to the blog.\nWhat that means is the sides of the phone will be pressure sensitive so that you can trigger certain actions, like calling up Google Assistant, simply by squeezing the outside of the phone. It's not clear if this will work exactly the same on the Pixel as it does on the U11, but on the U 11 you can set different shortcuts for different types of squeezes.\nA quick squeeze, for example, could take a screenshot, while a longer one could call up the Google Assistant. If that sounds weird, that's because it is. But at the same time, it's not a completely pointless feature, even if it's a gimmicky one.\nOr, as Mashable's senior tech correspondent Ray Wong said after spending some time with the U 11: \"It's a gimmick, but it's a somewhat natural and practical one, and if you don't like it you can turn it off.\"\nGoogle is expected to launch the next generation of its Pixel phones later this year.\nWATCH: Master the game of ping pong with this robot"},"shares":{"facebook":77,"linked_in":7,"twitter":254,"stumble_upon":203,"google_plus":2,"pinterest":1,"total":544},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xgOuweboZYRj1MX0baXKTI6ZBoo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F533041%2F23d317f9-136e-447d-a6af-c1d183a56b62.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OXOxO80jXX712iUXIuXpSJGA1iA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gXyKx2uDQ37AS0PmcoGlyCakUi8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/soeImlU77ln3JMqe6psCCFB-dHA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1qiMyBDg3wbAyjMW8ceQ2yiWk_Q=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B-kPxiDjNayR0sp2W9Z8_rfrDiU=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sNeBSv","display_title":"New leaked photo shows Pixel 2 might have a major gimmick","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5EKnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"This could be the next Pixel.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"New leaked photo shows Pixel 2 might have a major gimmick"},{"_id":"59644aaef11b2c012e0000be","id":"2017/07/10/newspapers-congress-antitrust-pass","title":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-07-11T03:48:31+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 03:48:31 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"535","sort_key":"1DuMU3","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/newspapers-congress-antitrust-pass/","content":{"plain":"Newspapers have long considered Facebook and Google their frenemies.\nOn the one hand, they rely on both to distribute their words and ads to a mass audience as print ads and subscription dollars plummet.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook and Google are destroying bad online ads, which is great until they own the world\nBut by doing so, the two tech giants have now ballooned in size to the point where there's little room left for anyone else in the industry to breathe.\nFacebook and Google now collectively control around $.70 of every dollar spent on digital ads. The portion of three remaining dimes that isn't vacuumed up by other platforms like Twitter, Snapchat or Verizon-AOL-Yahoo! or any number of ad tech middleman is split between hundreds of media outlets each competing for a sliver of a cent.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power when it comes to working with these platforms. Facebook and Google do ultimately need the media and the content they produce to fuel their platforms. But when the two titans are the only two information distribution channels of any significance in town, they can easily pit news outlets against one another to get the best deal for themselves.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power ...\nThat prisoner's dilemma pushed news publishers to do something unusual this week. Behind the banner of the News Media Alliance -- a trade group that encompasses more than 2,000 newspapers, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post -- they are asking Congress for permission to act as a team in negotiations with the two platforms.\nWithout a specific pass from the government, the coordination could run afoul of antitrust laws, which are meant to prevent monopolies and maintain competitive markets. The request is therefore a bit ironic, considering that its goal is to confront existing duopoly powers.\nThe bid could be a long shot in a Republican-controlled Congress under an administration that's not exactly on good terms with the country's news media.\nBut the news industry is getting desperate. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern said the threat posed by Google and Facebook dwarfed that of the president's relentless efforts to delegitimize and undercut the press. \n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together,\" Chavern wrote. \"Antitrust laws are insulating Google and Facebook from market forces.\"\nThe newspapers aren't the first to recognize the need to make peace with competitors in the face of Silicon Valley might. Ad-sharing agreements and controlled exchanges to buy and sell them have been increasingly common among media companies. Three of the biggest ad tech firms forged an unprecedented alliance to pool their data earlier this year.\nAnd even the heads of the world's biggest advertisers are calling for a unified front as they face down the two heavyweights on a laundry list of grievances, including transparency in how their ads are measured, where on the web they are placed, and how fraud is kept to a minimum.\n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together\"\n\"The days of giving digital a pass are over,\" Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer of Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, said in a call to arms at an Association of National Advertisers meeting in January. \"It's time to grow up. It's time for action.\"   \nAccording to Chavern's op-ed, the group was emboldened by a landmark antitrust ruling in the European Union in which Google was fined more than $2.7 billion for \"abusing dominance\" in the search market. European regulators are often seen as a bellwether of approaches that might eventually cross the Atlantic.\nBut there are definite risks if the government won't grant the group antitrust exemption. A handful of print publishers butted heads with antitrust regulators when they tried to form a similar arrangement to work with Apple on an ebook competitor a few years ago. \nFor their part, Facebook and Google have paid lip service to the need to incentivize quality journalism and granted publishers some minor concessions. An ad filter built into an upcoming version of Google Chrome, for instance, will include a way for readers to choose to pay publications directly instead of blocking their ads. There are also reports that Facebook is working towards a paid subscription model for its Instant Articles program.\n\"We’re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook. We’re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do,\" Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said in a statement on Monday.\nGoogle echoed the sentiment.\n“We remain deeply committed to helping publishers with both their challenges, and their opportunities,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\nPublishers are now ready to test that commitment.\nWATCH: Google Glass for autistic kids \n\n  "},"shares":{"facebook":71,"twitter":376,"google_plus":11,"linked_in":77,"total":535},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8aORZ1HPaG33HH47g-eUElJC_os=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531748%2Fc69af0d5-b164-4967-b708-d893301223ae.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qbHaZRa3rF_hgL9_NyD-wDLK0u8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/L3q09SBVA6Tzo_TnTJsJIwORVm4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VZ_DXbofa071yWpwp0NRPkJY3Wo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mF60voS_2HFgBWfJe7a82cPkODQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FFz2m-BH7DKwHUeJSf-Ea05-lCk=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sYHGyL","display_title":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"qeGlvzylkX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Newspapers are seeking a pass from Congress to team up.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google"},{"_id":"59642b0af11b2c72190002a8","id":"2017/07/10/google-android-panic-button","title":"Your next Android might come with a 'panic button' to exit shady apps","title_tag":null,"author":"Jack Morse","post_date":"2017-07-11T01:33:08+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 01:33:08 +0000","formatted_date":"07/11/2017","formatted_shares":"372","sort_key":"1DuLzN","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/google-android-panic-button/","content":{"plain":"We've all done it — clicked on that shady link, downloaded that questionable app, or hit \"submit\" on some online form only to instantly realize we've fallen victim to some form of hack.\nIt turns out that Google might just have a solution for us. Well, a partial one, anyway. \nSEE ALSO: Whoops. Millions of Android phones are wide open to hackers\nAccording to XDA-Developers and Bleeping Computer, Google has added a \"panic button\" feature to Android 7.1 that would allow smartphone users to quickly exit a misbehaving app upon the realization that something is amiss. So just as quickly as you yell out \"oh shit,\" you can shut down the offending party. \nHere's how it would work: A person rapidly hits the back button four times, and Android exits out of all apps. Basically, if an app begins to take over your screen, you have a way out. \nPretty cool, right?\n\nThis feature couldn't come soon enough, as the fear of treacherous apps is not some fantasyland threat. It was just this past April that a group of researchers determined hundreds of apps in the Google Play store had a vulnerability that could leave phones open to hackers.

According to authorities, the speaker heard these words, \"did you call the sheriffs\" and then called the police.\nSEE ALSO: Smart speaker calls 911 during domestic dispute, police rescue woman and daughter\nOn Sunday the Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. in New Mexico identified the incredibly helpful speaker as a Google Home device, only to recant a few hours later. \nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nGoogle confirmed on Monday to Mashable via email that not only did early reports misidentify the device, but Google Home still doesn't allow calling -- of any kind. \"That feature was announced at I/O, but hasn't been launched yet,\" wrote a spokesperson.\nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nSimilarly, Amazon confirmed to us via email that its voice assistant Alexa does not support calling 911. When we asked if there are any conditions under which this scenario could have occurred with an Amazon Echo Device, a spokesperson added, \"Alexa calling and messaging does not support calling 911, nor is the Alexa calling and messaging service able to connect to third-party calling services to do so.\" \nThere's even an Alexa Skills policy that disallows developers from including the ability to call 911 within their skills.\nWhich means it was, potentially, the \"sheriffs\" phrase that prompted Alexa's action. Mashable tried the phrase, \"did you call the sheriffs\" with both an Amazon Echo Show and Google Home. Neither responded. Even when engaged with the proper trigger words, Alexa and Home didn't understand the phrase as something actionable.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office deputy and spokesperson Felicia Romero admitted to Mashable on Monday that they're not particularly tech-savvy and are unsure of what device was hooked up to the Amazon Alexa system. They did not take photos of the scene.\nInstead, Romero described how Barros allegedly said, \"Did you call the sheriffs?\" which they believe may have been interpreted as \"Call the Sheriffs.\" \"Maybe \"Sheriff\" is programmed on the phone,\" offered Deputy Romero. Ultimately, they don't know what the system heard as a prompt.\nAmazon did introduce voice-calling features in May that work across all of its Echo devices as well as the Alexa app on iOS and Android. These systems can pull in your smartphone contacts and let you call them directly through an Alexa-enabled device. Even so, you always have to say \"Alexa, call [name of contact]\" to initiate an Alexa call.\nSome of the confusion surrounding this story can be traced back to the original police report, which Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. provided on Monday. Here's an excerpt:\nBarros then asked [the alleged victim] ‘did you call the Sheriff’s”. At this point Alexis [sic] which Affiant knows to be a Google Smart Radio, heard “call Sheriff’s”. Alexis the radio then called 911. This is when 911 was notified and deputies responded.  \nAs for the stereo system, the spokesperson explained that Alexa is connected to it and it's spread throughout the home so Barros can answer a phone call from any room in the house. Typically, Amazon's original Echo devices, which include a speaker (as does Google Home), are stand-alone devices. The cheaper, smaller Echo Dot, which includes a microphone listening array, but only a tiny speaker, is often hooked up to a user's stereo system. However, the Sheriff's Dept. offered no insight on which Alexa-supporting device Barros owns. \nWhat they did tell us, though, is that, just prior to the argument, the couple was using an Amazon system to watch a movie. \nEven with these new details, questions remain. Virtually all smart assistants, including smart home speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, listen only for their trigger words -- \"Alexa\" and \"Okay, Google\" (\"Hey, Siri\" for Apple's Siri) -- before listening for general commands and acting. It's unclear what words, if any preceded the \"sheriff\" comment.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office can confirm the existence of a call because, Deputy Romero told us, the line was left open and, in addition to the fighting the victim can be overheard in the background saying, \"Alexa, call 911,\" seemingly unaware that a call had already been made and that calling 911 isn't enabled on Amazon Echo devices.\nWe may never know exactly how (or if) Alexa made that call, but one thing is clear, the digital act may have saved someone's life.\nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"twitter":331,"facebook":260,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":36,"total":635},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MkGkoA09uIIqrLhh0Fhz7YBHTfA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531007%2F1ad09c39-e3a9-4b48-90f3-bfe3001dd670.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cMQpfrYM4H0LIIZrK6VbpvbaWzM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p2yUGLf_HRfnYRNRM6dEkkX2wVg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zWlSjZKCdkgP4oJ22jA7tM5rfsU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bdYbgGfaJIq2X-w6mKz7UkpEUog=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tLtr-3SbAP4R0kzfEjMysJJEX84=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2v4q4Oy","display_title":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvwg8okX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Did Alexa answer a cry for help?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute"},{"_id":"5963a482f11b2c073d000ce9","id":"2017/07/10/google-unveils-pair-ai-initiative","title":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems","title_tag":null,"author":"Lance Ulanoff","post_date":"2017-07-10T16:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 16:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"07/10/2017","formatted_shares":"1.4k","sort_key":"1DuB6o","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/google-unveils-pair-ai-initiative/","content":{"plain":"How do we prevent pre-existing biases from bleeding into the artificial intelligence systems we're increasingly relying on for day-to-day tasks? By paying closer attention to the data and machine learning used to build those AIs.\nGoogle's new initiative, PAIR, or People + AI Research, unveiled on Monday, seeks to put human considerations like this at the front of AI development.\nSEE ALSO: How the scary potential of AI brought tech competitors together\nIn a blog post on PAIR, senior staff research scientists from the Google Brain team, Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, write, \"By building AI systems with users in mind from the ground up, we open up entire new areas of design and interaction.\"\nThe team believes part of the solution for how to build AI systems that consider actual human needs is to treat AI less as a collection of algorithms that you can apply to various problems and more as a design material or medium like paint. They also want to pair that perspective with tools and training that help those building AI and machine learning systems view it and develop for it in a more people-centric way.\nTo help guide AI development, the team will focus on three areas: Tools for AI engineers and researchers, how they can build tools to help people working in verticals like healthcare, farming and music effectively apply AI, and the inclusivity of AI systems.\nIt's that last part that may resonate with people inside and outside of Google.\nPAIR is not Google's first \"let's get a handle on AI\" effort. The tech giant is a founding member of the  Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (\"Partnership on AI\" for short). Both groups recognize that the key to unbiased AI is better training data (Machine Learning systems are typically trained with mountains of example data to build artificial intelligence around things like object and face recognition, speech translation, and even cancer research).\nLast year, Partnership for AI founding member and Microsoft Research Technical Fellow and Managing Director Eric Horvitz told me, \"Bias in data can get propagated to machine learning that can lead to biased systems.” He also worried that biased AI could impact, “how racial minorities are handled when it comes to visual perception and facial recognition.”\nWhile Google acknowledges that Partnership on AI and PAIR are complementary efforts, the two are not directly tied together. Even so, a key component of PAIR is the open-sourcing of two Google visual tools, Facets Overview and Facets Drive. Both deal with training data.\n\"We think this is important because training data is a key ingredient in modern AI systems, but it can often be a source of opacity and confusion. Indeed, one of the ways that ML engineering seems different than traditional software engineering is a stronger need to debug not just code, but data too,\" wrote the Google Brain Team.\nIt's not just the AI world at large that has work to do on AI data and output. In April, researchers at  University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Princeton University found gender-based bias in numerous AI systems, including Google Translate where it automatically \"converts gender-neutral pronouns from several languages into 'he' when talking about a doctor, and 'she' when talking about a nurse.\"\nGoogle never explicitly mentions \"bias\" in its PAIR announcement, but it's clear that the company wants to use early human input to make AI output a little less artificial. \nWATCH: AI Robot can teach people how to play tennis"},"shares":{"facebook":100,"twitter":332,"google_plus":18,"linked_in":170,"stumble_upon":829,"total":1449},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-9pqsQQA-8omVTH4Q1N8sBCJXeA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530962%2F5472dbf7-1dfe-4de6-9cd8-e32436b4fd5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FTQ0ZlpgjRa9BM3FgWiuUvSwiyQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-pjm0UAzuvFDbPon74HsiC4wYp0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/APoovCqD6Sey4Gc_RJ2F8V5J1Ls=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oCuT3SOhB7QmLv0WH1AGQ9W_QpQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yHNL2lfb7PyzDiL6UMlBlE9sm-Y=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sWM3KK","display_title":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Adbl3LXo3q","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Taking artificial out of AI.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems"},{"_id":"59638e77f11b2c073d000c19","id":"2017/07/10/snacphat-net-neutrality-day-july-12-facebook-google","title":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2017-07-10T14:25:58+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 14:25:58 +0000","formatted_date":"07/10/2017","formatted_shares":"443","sort_key":"1DuApU","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/snacphat-net-neutrality-day-july-12-facebook-google/","content":{"plain":"A free and open internet is at stake, and the tech giants aren't letting it go without a fight.\nSnap Inc., the parent of Snapchat, is just the latest tech company to throw its public support behind the open internet in a statement sent to Mashable. \nSEE ALSO: Light up the John Oliver signal: The battle over Net Neutrality is back\nThe company also confirmed its participation in Net Neutrality Day through the Internet Association, a trade group that represents many of the tech giants on issues related to the internet.

The web platforms include Airbnb, Dropbox, Spotify, Google, Facebook, and now Snap Inc. \n\nWATCH: Aerial footage shows Chernobyl 30 years after the world’s worst nuclear disaster"},"shares":{"facebook":83,"twitter":292,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":60,"total":443},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ylSizOpAavT7Q9Gf1v4Vwwh0ozg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530822%2F222dbbab-67d4-4e1a-89e4-bde8388c9749.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JFBZ9skNPf9f824e-__FgRNQm2s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aFl8xRenl7pWCAxfSFkyhsPsol4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n9Tgd4pNy_PGNBhLhQLfyxHB0Ho=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/IGbwfbBwFqrSftp6aP_Zq7Z8U9k=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zgRTaTQn1Ve2_yATh0g1jav3XjA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50924%2F9ebe1525-33d0-47cc-b009-a3a3591ed382.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tGknqr","display_title":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"MboWbOzl8e","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The day of action is on July 12.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon"},{"_id":"59623fc928cc36557d0004cc","id":"2017/07/09/learn-google-analytics-for-29-bucks","title":"Understand Google Analytics like a pro for just $29","title_tag":null,"author":"Team Commerce","post_date":"2017-07-09T14:37:25+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 09 Jul 2017 14:37:25 +0000","formatted_date":"07/09/2017","formatted_shares":"695","sort_key":"1DudkV","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/09/learn-google-analytics-for-29-bucks/","content":{"plain":"Just to let you know, if you buy something featured here, Mashable might earn an affiliate commission.Let’s face it: if you want your website to be successful, you need to use Google Analytics.

Your inevitable robot replacements are picking up steam -- and more importantly, sponsorship -- with another show of support from the world's biggest tech company. \nGoogle's Digital News Initiative (DNI), a fund that promotes innovation in digital journalism in Europe, just announced its latest round of sponsored projects. Among them is RADAR, a collaboration between the UK and Ireland's Press Association (PA) and Urbs Media, a startup that creates localized news stories using AI.     \nDNI awarded the RADAR project (which stands for Reporters And Data And Robots, natch) a €706,000 (roughly $804,000) grant. That influx of cash will be used to create a service that will ramp up automated news efforts, with natural language generation (NLG) AI programs pumping out up to 30,000 stories per month across localized distribution networks starting in 2018. All the components of the AI-created stories will be automated, from the words on the screen to the graphics and images that accompany them.\nTo start, the AI will be tasked with producing low-level stories from templates created by human writers. These types of stories are important, but not incredibly labor intensive -- think sports recaps and earnings reports -- and even a human writer would be filling in the blanks with the necessary data to create them, not using actual brain power for analysis, like what I'm doing right now. Journalists, like just about every type of professional, have some thankless, easily repeatable responsibilities. That's where the AI comes in, at least to start. \nSEE ALSO: Will a robot take your job? This website provides an answer (that you probably won't like)\nDue to the humdrum nature of the AI-produced stories, human writers and editors have no cause for concern about being replaced by robots, at least according to PA's Editor-in-Chief Peter Clifton, who called RADAR a \"fantastic step forward for PA,\" in a release announcing the DNI sponsorship. “Skilled human journalists will still be vital in the process, but RADAR allows us to harness artificial intelligence to scale up to a volume of local stories that would be impossible to provide manually,” he said. \nThe project will require a team of five people to \"identify, template, and edit data-driven stories,\" about topics like crime, health, and employment, so humans aren't eliminated from the equation completely -- but under more traditional circumstances a five-person squad could never wrangle the full load of 30,000 stories per month. There's also something to be said about how young writers might cut their teeth on the lowest levels of the copy desk, learning how to produce clean, accurate copy and absorbing the massive amounts of information they transcribe, which could provide context for bigger stories in the future. AI reporting could eliminate that essential experience.  \nThe DNI funding will also be used to create databases to for the AI to pull from, harnessing repositories of data from wider public databases in the UK like the National Health Service (NHS).  \nWhile this is just the latest example of AI journalism sweeping the digital media industry, it's not a new trend, by any means. Wordsmith, an NLG AI program, has been producing automated stories for the U.S.'s Associated Press (AP) since 2014, and other traditional outlets like the New York Times and Los Angeles Times have used automation for low-level reporting.\nYou might have even used AI to create your own content. Google's Smart Reply feature was found to have been responsible for up to 10 percent of email responses sent from mobile devices earlier this year. It's not as sophisticated as what RADAR will provide the PA -- but it's just another example of AI becoming more applicable and creeping into our daily lives.   \nJournalists like me aren't exactly mollified by all of the reassurances that the AI will simply be a tool to make our reporting more efficient. That might be the case right now -- but what about the future, when the software becomes more sophisticated? \nAutomation is a major future concern for just about every industry -- and, ya know, capitalism as a whole -- so when the machines finally rise in the not-so-distant-future, at least us lowly journalists might not be the only ones out of work. \nWATCH: This mixed reality room is so trippy it might leave you questioning reality"},"shares":{"twitter":429,"linked_in":153,"facebook":164,"google_plus":5,"total":751},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KdnIeti29UcL_kxqUvVIo7PDWZA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529160%2F76f77256-452f-4117-986b-35d373e7e258.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/m0x-jrOVdx0yBj6qB8AbfjVWdVA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nQV15IF6dKEtu2p3GSsFF0sL4J0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ss0UN1FC6Nvrjqu11y4l9a9uaQo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cx5a3h-g8Okc03V6B4gNpugrwz0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_aZG9zKnbxqPCd49G8ns2GXP-Rs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2u0ggIL","display_title":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5NJnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"This story would've been so much better if AI wrote it...","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe"},{"_id":"595f6d3528cc3667b0000979","id":"2017/07/07/google-assistant-app","title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","title_tag":null,"author":"Michael Nuñez","post_date":"2017-07-07T11:15:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 11:15:00 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"708","sort_key":"1Dtsup","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/google-assistant-app/","content":{"plain":"Let’s face it: Most voice assistants are still too dumb be useful in everyday life. Siri is an abomination, and even Alexa can’t answer some of the most basic questions that I ask. Luckily for me, Google Assistant has gotten ridiculously smart in the past year, and it's legitimately changed my life since I've started using it.\nSEE ALSO: Hey, Siri, Google Assistant is coming to the iPhone — and it's getting smarter\nGoogle Assistant wasn't always great, and it wasn't even widely available until recently. When the search giant launched its artificially intelligent assistant back in May 2016, it was exclusively available for the company's own Pixel phone. \nGoogle didn’t even give other Android phone makers like Samsung and LG access to the app. If you didn't have a Pixel phone, you were simply out of luck.\nBut things finally changed for the better about a month ago. This May at Google I/O, the company finally announced it was releasing the app on Android’s chief rival, iOS. \nSafe to say most iPhone fans didn’t notice or hated the experience. Our very own reporter Karissa Bell detailed the ridiculous issues she faced when using the app shortly after launch. Even my first few experiences testing the app were grim -- but I vowed to check back in every week or so to see if I could find new uses for it. What I've learned in the ensuing month is that Google Assistant for iOS is practically the only app I need.\nGoogle Assistant has straight up improved my quality of life. The first time I discovered just how useful it could be, I was riding my bike. It was pretty late, and I may or may not have had some adult beverages, and I was trying to navigate an unfamiliar part of Brooklyn. I remember belligerently opening the app and asking, \"How do i get home?\"\nThe app heroically pulled up directions to my apartment across town, and with the push of a button, it launched Google Maps, and I was soon biking in the right direction, safely in my own bike lane. Phew. Huge save by the assistant.\nSEE ALSO: Google's likely ditching HTC for LG when it comes to the next Pixel\nThen it saved me in a pinch again. The second time it was earlier in the morning, and I was running behind schedule as I got ready. I asked my phone what was on my calendar, and pulled up a preview of my events with -- crucially -- with the locations of each of the events.\nOne of the events happened to be a fancier outing for my gaudy friend who was throwing himself a birthday. The evening was starting at a hotel bar. Woof. Not only was I surprised, I had to change and basically revaluate my plans for the day. No bag. No sneakers. Another crucial save chalked up to Google Assistant.\nThat's when I was sold.\nThe reality is that these apps are made for people who are completely disorganized, overwhelmed with the realities of being an adult, and need constant prodding to stay on course. They're for weaklings -- and unfortunately, I fall right into that target demographic. I can't say it's the best looking or most fun app that I use, but it's finally starting to work exactly as its designers intended. It helps me course-correct, and for that reason, it's my new favorite app on the iPhone.\nWATCH: This Japanese home assistant is a holographic girl that lives in a jar"},"shares":{"facebook":276,"google_plus":14,"linked_in":42,"twitter":376,"total":708},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8iL6EEX1nl_Uos-Ps4ZgaWMFSYw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528698%2Ffe5cd430-3ea8-429b-b19f-fb134bb42f92.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6BzGVUUn0cFyAmmggiUUjmXhPyY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5zVyf_I1_0DR9jKMrRgekcKaWOE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/57MKciDsXgdoqVOOeS9v4KSUgu0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qcCyTNSy_4kzEOXtRX2Lqo2tS4Y=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CXYRtuDyQ_Ao1NPErwbGey-QVHQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tTFqbd","display_title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"OBlPB920Xe","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Google Assistant is my co-pilot.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":7524}

By paying closer attention to the data and machine learning used to build those AIs.\nGoogle's new initiative, PAIR, or People + AI Research, unveiled on Monday, seeks to put human considerations like this at the front of AI development.\nSEE ALSO: How the scary potential of AI brought tech competitors together\nIn a blog post on PAIR, senior staff research scientists from the Google Brain team, Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg, write, \"By building AI systems with users in mind from the ground up, we open up entire new areas of design and interaction.\"\nThe team believes part of the solution for how to build AI systems that consider actual human needs is to treat AI less as a collection of algorithms that you can apply to various problems and more as a design material or medium like paint. They also want to pair that perspective with tools and training that help those building AI and machine learning systems view it and develop for it in a more people-centric way.\nTo help guide AI development, the team will focus on three areas: Tools for AI engineers and researchers, how they can build tools to help people working in verticals like healthcare, farming and music effectively apply AI, and the inclusivity of AI systems.\nIt's that last part that may resonate with people inside and outside of Google.\nPAIR is not Google's first \"let's get a handle on AI\" effort. The tech giant is a founding member of the  Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (\"Partnership on AI\" for short). Both groups recognize that the key to unbiased AI is better training data (Machine Learning systems are typically trained with mountains of example data to build artificial intelligence around things like object and face recognition, speech translation, and even cancer research).\nLast year, Partnership for AI founding member and Microsoft Research Technical Fellow and Managing Director Eric Horvitz told me, \"Bias in data can get propagated to machine learning that can lead to biased systems.” He also worried that biased AI could impact, “how racial minorities are handled when it comes to visual perception and facial recognition.”\nWhile Google acknowledges that Partnership on AI and PAIR are complementary efforts, the two are not directly tied together. Even so, a key component of PAIR is the open-sourcing of two Google visual tools, Facets Overview and Facets Drive. Both deal with training data.\n\"We think this is important because training data is a key ingredient in modern AI systems, but it can often be a source of opacity and confusion. Indeed, one of the ways that ML engineering seems different than traditional software engineering is a stronger need to debug not just code, but data too,\" wrote the Google Brain Team.\nIt's not just the AI world at large that has work to do on AI data and output. In April, researchers at  University of Bath in the United Kingdom and Princeton University found gender-based bias in numerous AI systems, including Google Translate where it automatically \"converts gender-neutral pronouns from several languages into 'he' when talking about a doctor, and 'she' when talking about a nurse.\"\nGoogle never explicitly mentions \"bias\" in its PAIR announcement, but it's clear that the company wants to use early human input to make AI output a little less artificial. \nWATCH: AI Robot can teach people how to play tennis"},"shares":{"facebook":100,"twitter":332,"google_plus":18,"linked_in":170,"stumble_upon":829,"total":1449},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-9pqsQQA-8omVTH4Q1N8sBCJXeA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530962%2F5472dbf7-1dfe-4de6-9cd8-e32436b4fd5d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FTQ0ZlpgjRa9BM3FgWiuUvSwiyQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-pjm0UAzuvFDbPon74HsiC4wYp0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/APoovCqD6Sey4Gc_RJ2F8V5J1Ls=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oCuT3SOhB7QmLv0WH1AGQ9W_QpQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yHNL2lfb7PyzDiL6UMlBlE9sm-Y=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50912%2Fe936e91f-a994-4586-8c05-1edf5f0d0355.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sWM3KK","display_title":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Adbl3LXo3q","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Taking artificial out of AI.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Google wants to build 'people-centric' AI systems"},{"_id":"595b6812f11b2c72ce001f13","id":"2017/07/04/nasdaq-error-123-47","title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2017-07-04T10:02:26+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 10:02:26 +0000","formatted_date":"07/04/2017","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1DsGtG","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/04/nasdaq-error-123-47/","content":{"plain":"For one moment on Monday afternoon, the prices of several stocks on Nasdaq -- including those of Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, and Microsoft -- were all priced exactly the same, $123.47.\nObviously, this couldn't be correct; it would mean a sudden, massive drop in value for Amazon and Google and a huge increase in value for Microsoft and eBay.

That, however, was a far more dangerous occurrence, as the stock prices really did plummet due to a combination of market manipulations and automated high-frequency trading tools which initiated a selling frenzy. \nMonday's glitch was different. Despite sporadic claims of some trades being made at the $123.47 price, Nasdaq told the FT that it did not affect market trading. The biggest consequences appear to be a bit of confusion among traders and a fun day for companies like Sears and Zynga, who saw their stock prices suddenly jump by a few thousand percent. \nWATCH: The future of selfies is this camera drone with facial recognition"},"shares":{"linked_in":513,"twitter":381,"google_plus":10,"facebook":227,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HD5cr-AeSEj3-VYrtBbyxGY5anY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F526213%2F7ca4c779-f75b-4336-b871-a7f8979fa0fc.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ilyz0EZDCaA2B75IRrVGUlkptVs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RLoWJmGA8pwiV_Ma6sNf_UcXxVU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xc8LsWxC-AUY2bOq_ogzL5PNx7M=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tDhi3bArj6aoFDOxhEipPuJczgM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/shF4UqFEfSkyjOdZy5V5qb4BlCc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ukMNq5","display_title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"R6k01Z9nVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"An odd glitch Monday caused the stock prices of several companies listed on Nasdaq to be exactly the same: $123.47.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday"},{"_id":"595fbbb9f11b2c2a2a000a61","id":"2017/07/07/google-ai-journalism-funding-europe","title":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-07-07T16:49:45+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 16:49:45 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"751","sort_key":"1Dtygo","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/google-ai-journalism-funding-europe/","content":{"plain":"Human journalists, start the countdown to your obsolescence (if you haven't already, that is). Your inevitable robot replacements are picking up steam -- and more importantly, sponsorship -- with another show of support from the world's biggest tech company. \nGoogle's Digital News Initiative (DNI), a fund that promotes innovation in digital journalism in Europe, just announced its latest round of sponsored projects. Among them is RADAR, a collaboration between the UK and Ireland's Press Association (PA) and Urbs Media, a startup that creates localized news stories using AI.     \nDNI awarded the RADAR project (which stands for Reporters And Data And Robots, natch) a €706,000 (roughly $804,000) grant. That influx of cash will be used to create a service that will ramp up automated news efforts, with natural language generation (NLG) AI programs pumping out up to 30,000 stories per month across localized distribution networks starting in 2018. All the components of the AI-created stories will be automated, from the words on the screen to the graphics and images that accompany them.\nTo start, the AI will be tasked with producing low-level stories from templates created by human writers. These types of stories are important, but not incredibly labor intensive -- think sports recaps and earnings reports -- and even a human writer would be filling in the blanks with the necessary data to create them, not using actual brain power for analysis, like what I'm doing right now. Journalists, like just about every type of professional, have some thankless, easily repeatable responsibilities. That's where the AI comes in, at least to start. \nSEE ALSO: Will a robot take your job? This website provides an answer (that you probably won't like)\nDue to the humdrum nature of the AI-produced stories, human writers and editors have no cause for concern about being replaced by robots, at least according to PA's Editor-in-Chief Peter Clifton, who called RADAR a \"fantastic step forward for PA,\" in a release announcing the DNI sponsorship. “Skilled human journalists will still be vital in the process, but RADAR allows us to harness artificial intelligence to scale up to a volume of local stories that would be impossible to provide manually,” he said. \nThe project will require a team of five people to \"identify, template, and edit data-driven stories,\" about topics like crime, health, and employment, so humans aren't eliminated from the equation completely -- but under more traditional circumstances a five-person squad could never wrangle the full load of 30,000 stories per month. There's also something to be said about how young writers might cut their teeth on the lowest levels of the copy desk, learning how to produce clean, accurate copy and absorbing the massive amounts of information they transcribe, which could provide context for bigger stories in the future. AI reporting could eliminate that essential experience.  \nThe DNI funding will also be used to create databases to for the AI to pull from, harnessing repositories of data from wider public databases in the UK like the National Health Service (NHS).  \nWhile this is just the latest example of AI journalism sweeping the digital media industry, it's not a new trend, by any means. Wordsmith, an NLG AI program, has been producing automated stories for the U.S.'s Associated Press (AP) since 2014, and other traditional outlets like the New York Times and Los Angeles Times have used automation for low-level reporting.\nYou might have even used AI to create your own content. Google's Smart Reply feature was found to have been responsible for up to 10 percent of email responses sent from mobile devices earlier this year. It's not as sophisticated as what RADAR will provide the PA -- but it's just another example of AI becoming more applicable and creeping into our daily lives.   \nJournalists like me aren't exactly mollified by all of the reassurances that the AI will simply be a tool to make our reporting more efficient. That might be the case right now -- but what about the future, when the software becomes more sophisticated? \nAutomation is a major future concern for just about every industry -- and, ya know, capitalism as a whole -- so when the machines finally rise in the not-so-distant-future, at least us lowly journalists might not be the only ones out of work. \nWATCH: This mixed reality room is so trippy it might leave you questioning reality"},"shares":{"twitter":429,"linked_in":153,"facebook":164,"google_plus":5,"total":751},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KdnIeti29UcL_kxqUvVIo7PDWZA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529160%2F76f77256-452f-4117-986b-35d373e7e258.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/m0x-jrOVdx0yBj6qB8AbfjVWdVA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nQV15IF6dKEtu2p3GSsFF0sL4J0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ss0UN1FC6Nvrjqu11y4l9a9uaQo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cx5a3h-g8Okc03V6B4gNpugrwz0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_aZG9zKnbxqPCd49G8ns2GXP-Rs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2u0ggIL","display_title":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5NJnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"This story would've been so much better if AI wrote it...","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe"},{"_id":"595f6d3528cc3667b0000979","id":"2017/07/07/google-assistant-app","title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","title_tag":null,"author":"Michael Nuñez","post_date":"2017-07-07T11:15:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 11:15:00 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"708","sort_key":"1Dtsup","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/google-assistant-app/","content":{"plain":"Let’s face it: Most voice assistants are still too dumb be useful in everyday life. Siri is an abomination, and even Alexa can’t answer some of the most basic questions that I ask. Luckily for me, Google Assistant has gotten ridiculously smart in the past year, and it's legitimately changed my life since I've started using it.\nSEE ALSO: Hey, Siri, Google Assistant is coming to the iPhone — and it's getting smarter\nGoogle Assistant wasn't always great, and it wasn't even widely available until recently. When the search giant launched its artificially intelligent assistant back in May 2016, it was exclusively available for the company's own Pixel phone. \nGoogle didn’t even give other Android phone makers like Samsung and LG access to the app. If you didn't have a Pixel phone, you were simply out of luck.\nBut things finally changed for the better about a month ago. This May at Google I/O, the company finally announced it was releasing the app on Android’s chief rival, iOS. \nSafe to say most iPhone fans didn’t notice or hated the experience. Our very own reporter Karissa Bell detailed the ridiculous issues she faced when using the app shortly after launch. Even my first few experiences testing the app were grim -- but I vowed to check back in every week or so to see if I could find new uses for it. What I've learned in the ensuing month is that Google Assistant for iOS is practically the only app I need.\nGoogle Assistant has straight up improved my quality of life. The first time I discovered just how useful it could be, I was riding my bike. It was pretty late, and I may or may not have had some adult beverages, and I was trying to navigate an unfamiliar part of Brooklyn. I remember belligerently opening the app and asking, \"How do i get home?\"\nThe app heroically pulled up directions to my apartment across town, and with the push of a button, it launched Google Maps, and I was soon biking in the right direction, safely in my own bike lane. Phew. Huge save by the assistant.\nSEE ALSO: Google's likely ditching HTC for LG when it comes to the next Pixel\nThen it saved me in a pinch again. The second time it was earlier in the morning, and I was running behind schedule as I got ready. I asked my phone what was on my calendar, and pulled up a preview of my events with -- crucially -- with the locations of each of the events.\nOne of the events happened to be a fancier outing for my gaudy friend who was throwing himself a birthday. The evening was starting at a hotel bar. Woof. Not only was I surprised, I had to change and basically revaluate my plans for the day. No bag. No sneakers. Another crucial save chalked up to Google Assistant.\nThat's when I was sold.\nThe reality is that these apps are made for people who are completely disorganized, overwhelmed with the realities of being an adult, and need constant prodding to stay on course. They're for weaklings -- and unfortunately, I fall right into that target demographic. I can't say it's the best looking or most fun app that I use, but it's finally starting to work exactly as its designers intended. It helps me course-correct, and for that reason, it's my new favorite app on the iPhone.\nWATCH: This Japanese home assistant is a holographic girl that lives in a jar"},"shares":{"facebook":276,"google_plus":14,"linked_in":42,"twitter":376,"total":708},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8iL6EEX1nl_Uos-Ps4ZgaWMFSYw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528698%2Ffe5cd430-3ea8-429b-b19f-fb134bb42f92.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6BzGVUUn0cFyAmmggiUUjmXhPyY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5zVyf_I1_0DR9jKMrRgekcKaWOE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/57MKciDsXgdoqVOOeS9v4KSUgu0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qcCyTNSy_4kzEOXtRX2Lqo2tS4Y=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CXYRtuDyQ_Ao1NPErwbGey-QVHQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tTFqbd","display_title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"OBlPB920Xe","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Google Assistant is my co-pilot.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life"},{"_id":"59623fc928cc36557d0004cc","id":"2017/07/09/learn-google-analytics-for-29-bucks","title":"Understand Google Analytics like a pro for just $29","title_tag":null,"author":"Team Commerce","post_date":"2017-07-09T14:37:25+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 09 Jul 2017 14:37:25 +0000","formatted_date":"07/09/2017","formatted_shares":"695","sort_key":"1DudkV","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/09/learn-google-analytics-for-29-bucks/","content":{"plain":"Just to let you know, if you buy something featured here, Mashable might earn an affiliate commission.Let’s face it: if you want your website to be successful, you need to use Google Analytics.

According to authorities, the speaker heard these words, \"did you call the sheriffs\" and then called the police.\nSEE ALSO: Smart speaker calls 911 during domestic dispute, police rescue woman and daughter\nOn Sunday the Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. in New Mexico identified the incredibly helpful speaker as a Google Home device, only to recant a few hours later. \nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nGoogle confirmed on Monday to Mashable via email that not only did early reports misidentify the device, but Google Home still doesn't allow calling -- of any kind. \"That feature was announced at I/O, but hasn't been launched yet,\" wrote a spokesperson.\nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nSimilarly, Amazon confirmed to us via email that its voice assistant Alexa does not support calling 911. When we asked if there are any conditions under which this scenario could have occurred with an Amazon Echo Device, a spokesperson added, \"Alexa calling and messaging does not support calling 911, nor is the Alexa calling and messaging service able to connect to third-party calling services to do so.\" \nThere's even an Alexa Skills policy that disallows developers from including the ability to call 911 within their skills.\nWhich means it was, potentially, the \"sheriffs\" phrase that prompted Alexa's action. Mashable tried the phrase, \"did you call the sheriffs\" with both an Amazon Echo Show and Google Home. Neither responded. Even when engaged with the proper trigger words, Alexa and Home didn't understand the phrase as something actionable.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office deputy and spokesperson Felicia Romero admitted to Mashable on Monday that they're not particularly tech-savvy and are unsure of what device was hooked up to the Amazon Alexa system. They did not take photos of the scene.\nInstead, Romero described how Barros allegedly said, \"Did you call the sheriffs?\" which they believe may have been interpreted as \"Call the Sheriffs.\" \"Maybe \"Sheriff\" is programmed on the phone,\" offered Deputy Romero. Ultimately, they don't know what the system heard as a prompt.\nAmazon did introduce voice-calling features in May that work across all of its Echo devices as well as the Alexa app on iOS and Android. These systems can pull in your smartphone contacts and let you call them directly through an Alexa-enabled device. Even so, you always have to say \"Alexa, call [name of contact]\" to initiate an Alexa call.\nSome of the confusion surrounding this story can be traced back to the original police report, which Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. provided on Monday. Here's an excerpt:\nBarros then asked [the alleged victim] ‘did you call the Sheriff’s”. At this point Alexis [sic] which Affiant knows to be a Google Smart Radio, heard “call Sheriff’s”. Alexis the radio then called 911. This is when 911 was notified and deputies responded.  \nAs for the stereo system, the spokesperson explained that Alexa is connected to it and it's spread throughout the home so Barros can answer a phone call from any room in the house. Typically, Amazon's original Echo devices, which include a speaker (as does Google Home), are stand-alone devices. The cheaper, smaller Echo Dot, which includes a microphone listening array, but only a tiny speaker, is often hooked up to a user's stereo system. However, the Sheriff's Dept. offered no insight on which Alexa-supporting device Barros owns. \nWhat they did tell us, though, is that, just prior to the argument, the couple was using an Amazon system to watch a movie. \nEven with these new details, questions remain. Virtually all smart assistants, including smart home speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, listen only for their trigger words -- \"Alexa\" and \"Okay, Google\" (\"Hey, Siri\" for Apple's Siri) -- before listening for general commands and acting. It's unclear what words, if any preceded the \"sheriff\" comment.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office can confirm the existence of a call because, Deputy Romero told us, the line was left open and, in addition to the fighting the victim can be overheard in the background saying, \"Alexa, call 911,\" seemingly unaware that a call had already been made and that calling 911 isn't enabled on Amazon Echo devices.\nWe may never know exactly how (or if) Alexa made that call, but one thing is clear, the digital act may have saved someone's life.\nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"twitter":331,"facebook":260,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":36,"total":635},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MkGkoA09uIIqrLhh0Fhz7YBHTfA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531007%2F1ad09c39-e3a9-4b48-90f3-bfe3001dd670.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cMQpfrYM4H0LIIZrK6VbpvbaWzM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p2yUGLf_HRfnYRNRM6dEkkX2wVg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zWlSjZKCdkgP4oJ22jA7tM5rfsU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bdYbgGfaJIq2X-w6mKz7UkpEUog=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tLtr-3SbAP4R0kzfEjMysJJEX84=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2v4q4Oy","display_title":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvwg8okX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Did Alexa answer a cry for help?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute"},{"_id":"59654489f11b2c08d4000220","id":"2017/07/11/pixel-xl-2-leaked-photo","title":"New leaked photo shows Pixel 2 might have a major gimmick","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2017-07-11T21:35:04+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 21:35:04 +0000","formatted_date":" 16 hours ago","formatted_shares":"544","sort_key":"1Dv4s3","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/11/pixel-xl-2-leaked-photo/","content":{"plain":"We just got what is likely our first good look at Google's next Pixel XL and it could have one big gimmicky feature. \nThe new image, which comes to us via Android Police, shows a handset that looks pretty similar to what Google launched last year. \nSEE ALSO: What the actual hell is going on with Google's newly redesigned Android emoji\nThere are a couple noticeable changes, though, including a larger rear-facing camera (notice how it's not a dual-lens setup) and a much slimmer bezel on the front of the display.  \nExclusive: This is the 2017 Google Pixel \"XL,\" with low-bezel AMOLED display and squeezable frame https://t.co/oAY97Rp73s pic.twitter.com/JZAZoAQrfJ— Android Police (@AndroidPolice) July 11, 2017\n\nBut Android Police reports the LG-made phone will also ship with one big new feature and, well, it's pretty gimmicky. The upcoming flagship will sport the same \"squeezeable\" frame technology as HTC's new U 11, according to the blog.\nWhat that means is the sides of the phone will be pressure sensitive so that you can trigger certain actions, like calling up Google Assistant, simply by squeezing the outside of the phone. It's not clear if this will work exactly the same on the Pixel as it does on the U11, but on the U 11 you can set different shortcuts for different types of squeezes.\nA quick squeeze, for example, could take a screenshot, while a longer one could call up the Google Assistant. If that sounds weird, that's because it is. But at the same time, it's not a completely pointless feature, even if it's a gimmicky one.\nOr, as Mashable's senior tech correspondent Ray Wong said after spending some time with the U 11: \"It's a gimmick, but it's a somewhat natural and practical one, and if you don't like it you can turn it off.\"\nGoogle is expected to launch the next generation of its Pixel phones later this year.\nWATCH: Master the game of ping pong with this robot"},"shares":{"facebook":77,"linked_in":7,"twitter":254,"stumble_upon":203,"google_plus":2,"pinterest":1,"total":544},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xgOuweboZYRj1MX0baXKTI6ZBoo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F533041%2F23d317f9-136e-447d-a6af-c1d183a56b62.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OXOxO80jXX712iUXIuXpSJGA1iA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gXyKx2uDQ37AS0PmcoGlyCakUi8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/soeImlU77ln3JMqe6psCCFB-dHA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1qiMyBDg3wbAyjMW8ceQ2yiWk_Q=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B-kPxiDjNayR0sp2W9Z8_rfrDiU=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F51120%2F9a224b8f-9071-45bb-b50f-8b41d78e4942.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sNeBSv","display_title":"New leaked photo shows Pixel 2 might have a major gimmick","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5EKnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"This could be the next Pixel.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"New leaked photo shows Pixel 2 might have a major gimmick"},{"_id":"59644aaef11b2c012e0000be","id":"2017/07/10/newspapers-congress-antitrust-pass","title":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-07-11T03:48:31+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 03:48:31 +0000","formatted_date":"1 day ago","formatted_shares":"535","sort_key":"1DuMU3","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/newspapers-congress-antitrust-pass/","content":{"plain":"Newspapers have long considered Facebook and Google their frenemies.\nOn the one hand, they rely on both to distribute their words and ads to a mass audience as print ads and subscription dollars plummet.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook and Google are destroying bad online ads, which is great until they own the world\nBut by doing so, the two tech giants have now ballooned in size to the point where there's little room left for anyone else in the industry to breathe.\nFacebook and Google now collectively control around $.70 of every dollar spent on digital ads. The portion of three remaining dimes that isn't vacuumed up by other platforms like Twitter, Snapchat or Verizon-AOL-Yahoo! or any number of ad tech middleman is split between hundreds of media outlets each competing for a sliver of a cent.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power when it comes to working with these platforms. Facebook and Google do ultimately need the media and the content they produce to fuel their platforms. But when the two titans are the only two information distribution channels of any significance in town, they can easily pit news outlets against one another to get the best deal for themselves.\nThe huge imbalance doesn't give the news media much bargaining power ...\nThat prisoner's dilemma pushed news publishers to do something unusual this week. Behind the banner of the News Media Alliance -- a trade group that encompasses more than 2,000 newspapers, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post -- they are asking Congress for permission to act as a team in negotiations with the two platforms.\nWithout a specific pass from the government, the coordination could run afoul of antitrust laws, which are meant to prevent monopolies and maintain competitive markets. The request is therefore a bit ironic, considering that its goal is to confront existing duopoly powers.\nThe bid could be a long shot in a Republican-controlled Congress under an administration that's not exactly on good terms with the country's news media.\nBut the news industry is getting desperate. In an op-ed published in the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, News Media Alliance CEO David Chavern said the threat posed by Google and Facebook dwarfed that of the president's relentless efforts to delegitimize and undercut the press. \n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together,\" Chavern wrote. \"Antitrust laws are insulating Google and Facebook from market forces.\"\nThe newspapers aren't the first to recognize the need to make peace with competitors in the face of Silicon Valley might. Ad-sharing agreements and controlled exchanges to buy and sell them have been increasingly common among media companies. Three of the biggest ad tech firms forged an unprecedented alliance to pool their data earlier this year.\nAnd even the heads of the world's biggest advertisers are calling for a unified front as they face down the two heavyweights on a laundry list of grievances, including transparency in how their ads are measured, where on the web they are placed, and how fraud is kept to a minimum.\n\"The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together\"\n\"The days of giving digital a pass are over,\" Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer of Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, said in a call to arms at an Association of National Advertisers meeting in January. \"It's time to grow up. It's time for action.\"   \nAccording to Chavern's op-ed, the group was emboldened by a landmark antitrust ruling in the European Union in which Google was fined more than $2.7 billion for \"abusing dominance\" in the search market. European regulators are often seen as a bellwether of approaches that might eventually cross the Atlantic.\nBut there are definite risks if the government won't grant the group antitrust exemption. A handful of print publishers butted heads with antitrust regulators when they tried to form a similar arrangement to work with Apple on an ebook competitor a few years ago. \nFor their part, Facebook and Google have paid lip service to the need to incentivize quality journalism and granted publishers some minor concessions. An ad filter built into an upcoming version of Google Chrome, for instance, will include a way for readers to choose to pay publications directly instead of blocking their ads. There are also reports that Facebook is working towards a paid subscription model for its Instant Articles program.\n\"We’re committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook. We’re making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do,\" Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said in a statement on Monday.\nGoogle echoed the sentiment.\n“We remain deeply committed to helping publishers with both their challenges, and their opportunities,” a spokesperson said in a statement.\nPublishers are now ready to test that commitment.\nWATCH: Google Glass for autistic kids \n\n  "},"shares":{"facebook":71,"twitter":376,"google_plus":11,"linked_in":77,"total":535},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8aORZ1HPaG33HH47g-eUElJC_os=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531748%2Fc69af0d5-b164-4967-b708-d893301223ae.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qbHaZRa3rF_hgL9_NyD-wDLK0u8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/L3q09SBVA6Tzo_TnTJsJIwORVm4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VZ_DXbofa071yWpwp0NRPkJY3Wo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mF60voS_2HFgBWfJe7a82cPkODQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FFz2m-BH7DKwHUeJSf-Ea05-lCk=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45601%2F8b9ac17a-447f-4f51-a128-8221947d011d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sYHGyL","display_title":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"qeGlvzylkX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Newspapers are seeking a pass from Congress to team up.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Why newspapers want to band together to take on Facebook and Google"},{"_id":"595e9a09f11b2c2a2a00001a","id":"2017/07/06/google-earth-voyager-explore-nature-livestream","title":"Watch a bear play in an Alaskan waterfall right from Google Earth","title_tag":null,"author":"Suzanne Ciechalski","post_date":"2017-07-06T20:13:30+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 20:13:30 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"492","sort_key":"1Dte2B","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/06/google-earth-voyager-explore-nature-livestream/","content":{"plain":"Thanks to Voyager, Google Earth's storytelling platform, you can now basically take an even deeper look at Alaska without having to leave your couch. \nPretty cool, right?\nSEE ALSO: Watch out Google Earth, Apple Maps has a hidden VR-like 'flyover' mode\nVoyager, which is essentially a collection of guided stories and tours based on maps, will begin streaming live content Thursday, starting with Katmai National Park in Alaska.

According to authorities, the speaker heard these words, \"did you call the sheriffs\" and then called the police.\nSEE ALSO: Smart speaker calls 911 during domestic dispute, police rescue woman and daughter\nOn Sunday the Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. in New Mexico identified the incredibly helpful speaker as a Google Home device, only to recant a few hours later. \nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nGoogle confirmed on Monday to Mashable via email that not only did early reports misidentify the device, but Google Home still doesn't allow calling -- of any kind. \"That feature was announced at I/O, but hasn't been launched yet,\" wrote a spokesperson.\nWhile initial reports indicated that the device dialed \"911,\" we now know that's technically impossible.\nSimilarly, Amazon confirmed to us via email that its voice assistant Alexa does not support calling 911. When we asked if there are any conditions under which this scenario could have occurred with an Amazon Echo Device, a spokesperson added, \"Alexa calling and messaging does not support calling 911, nor is the Alexa calling and messaging service able to connect to third-party calling services to do so.\" \nThere's even an Alexa Skills policy that disallows developers from including the ability to call 911 within their skills.\nWhich means it was, potentially, the \"sheriffs\" phrase that prompted Alexa's action. Mashable tried the phrase, \"did you call the sheriffs\" with both an Amazon Echo Show and Google Home. Neither responded. Even when engaged with the proper trigger words, Alexa and Home didn't understand the phrase as something actionable.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office deputy and spokesperson Felicia Romero admitted to Mashable on Monday that they're not particularly tech-savvy and are unsure of what device was hooked up to the Amazon Alexa system. They did not take photos of the scene.\nInstead, Romero described how Barros allegedly said, \"Did you call the sheriffs?\" which they believe may have been interpreted as \"Call the Sheriffs.\" \"Maybe \"Sheriff\" is programmed on the phone,\" offered Deputy Romero. Ultimately, they don't know what the system heard as a prompt.\nAmazon did introduce voice-calling features in May that work across all of its Echo devices as well as the Alexa app on iOS and Android. These systems can pull in your smartphone contacts and let you call them directly through an Alexa-enabled device. Even so, you always have to say \"Alexa, call [name of contact]\" to initiate an Alexa call.\nSome of the confusion surrounding this story can be traced back to the original police report, which Bernalillo County Sheriff Dept. provided on Monday. Here's an excerpt:\nBarros then asked [the alleged victim] ‘did you call the Sheriff’s”. At this point Alexis [sic] which Affiant knows to be a Google Smart Radio, heard “call Sheriff’s”. Alexis the radio then called 911. This is when 911 was notified and deputies responded.  \nAs for the stereo system, the spokesperson explained that Alexa is connected to it and it's spread throughout the home so Barros can answer a phone call from any room in the house. Typically, Amazon's original Echo devices, which include a speaker (as does Google Home), are stand-alone devices. The cheaper, smaller Echo Dot, which includes a microphone listening array, but only a tiny speaker, is often hooked up to a user's stereo system. However, the Sheriff's Dept. offered no insight on which Alexa-supporting device Barros owns. \nWhat they did tell us, though, is that, just prior to the argument, the couple was using an Amazon system to watch a movie. \nEven with these new details, questions remain. Virtually all smart assistants, including smart home speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home, listen only for their trigger words -- \"Alexa\" and \"Okay, Google\" (\"Hey, Siri\" for Apple's Siri) -- before listening for general commands and acting. It's unclear what words, if any preceded the \"sheriff\" comment.\nBernalillo County Sheriff’s Office can confirm the existence of a call because, Deputy Romero told us, the line was left open and, in addition to the fighting the victim can be overheard in the background saying, \"Alexa, call 911,\" seemingly unaware that a call had already been made and that calling 911 isn't enabled on Amazon Echo devices.\nWe may never know exactly how (or if) Alexa made that call, but one thing is clear, the digital act may have saved someone's life.\nWATCH: Someone rigged Amazon Echo and Google Home to talk to each other and it's hilarious"},"shares":{"twitter":331,"facebook":260,"google_plus":8,"linked_in":36,"total":635},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MkGkoA09uIIqrLhh0Fhz7YBHTfA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F531007%2F1ad09c39-e3a9-4b48-90f3-bfe3001dd670.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cMQpfrYM4H0LIIZrK6VbpvbaWzM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p2yUGLf_HRfnYRNRM6dEkkX2wVg=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zWlSjZKCdkgP4oJ22jA7tM5rfsU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bdYbgGfaJIq2X-w6mKz7UkpEUog=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tLtr-3SbAP4R0kzfEjMysJJEX84=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50931%2Fee9a2216-0763-4b3f-9807-be1984f06f2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2v4q4Oy","display_title":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"eGlvwg8okX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Did Alexa answer a cry for help?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Police: Amazon Alexa didn't call 911, but it did call us about domestic dispute"},{"_id":"59638e77f11b2c073d000c19","id":"2017/07/10/snacphat-net-neutrality-day-july-12-facebook-google","title":"Snapchat will finally join the Net Neutrality Day bandwagon","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2017-07-10T14:25:58+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 14:25:58 +0000","formatted_date":"07/10/2017","formatted_shares":"443","sort_key":"1DuApU","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/10/snacphat-net-neutrality-day-july-12-facebook-google/","content":{"plain":"A free and open internet is at stake, and the tech giants aren't letting it go without a fight.\nSnap Inc., the parent of Snapchat, is just the latest tech company to throw its public support behind the open internet in a statement sent to Mashable. \nSEE ALSO: Light up the John Oliver signal: The battle over Net Neutrality is back\nThe company also confirmed its participation in Net Neutrality Day through the Internet Association, a trade group that represents many of the tech giants on issues related to the internet.

Among them is RADAR, a collaboration between the UK and Ireland's Press Association (PA) and Urbs Media, a startup that creates localized news stories using AI.     \nDNI awarded the RADAR project (which stands for Reporters And Data And Robots, natch) a €706,000 (roughly $804,000) grant. That influx of cash will be used to create a service that will ramp up automated news efforts, with natural language generation (NLG) AI programs pumping out up to 30,000 stories per month across localized distribution networks starting in 2018. All the components of the AI-created stories will be automated, from the words on the screen to the graphics and images that accompany them.\nTo start, the AI will be tasked with producing low-level stories from templates created by human writers. These types of stories are important, but not incredibly labor intensive -- think sports recaps and earnings reports -- and even a human writer would be filling in the blanks with the necessary data to create them, not using actual brain power for analysis, like what I'm doing right now. Journalists, like just about every type of professional, have some thankless, easily repeatable responsibilities.

This website provides an answer (that you probably won't like)\nDue to the humdrum nature of the AI-produced stories, human writers and editors have no cause for concern about being replaced by robots, at least according to PA's Editor-in-Chief Peter Clifton, who called RADAR a \"fantastic step forward for PA,\" in a release announcing the DNI sponsorship. “Skilled human journalists will still be vital in the process, but RADAR allows us to harness artificial intelligence to scale up to a volume of local stories that would be impossible to provide manually,” he said. \nThe project will require a team of five people to \"identify, template, and edit data-driven stories,\" about topics like crime, health, and employment, so humans aren't eliminated from the equation completely -- but under more traditional circumstances a five-person squad could never wrangle the full load of 30,000 stories per month. There's also something to be said about how young writers might cut their teeth on the lowest levels of the copy desk, learning how to produce clean, accurate copy and absorbing the massive amounts of information they transcribe, which could provide context for bigger stories in the future. AI reporting could eliminate that essential experience.  \nThe DNI funding will also be used to create databases to for the AI to pull from, harnessing repositories of data from wider public databases in the UK like the National Health Service (NHS).  \nWhile this is just the latest example of AI journalism sweeping the digital media industry, it's not a new trend, by any means. Wordsmith, an NLG AI program, has been producing automated stories for the U.S.'s Associated Press (AP) since 2014, and other traditional outlets like the New York Times and Los Angeles Times have used automation for low-level reporting.\nYou might have even used AI to create your own content. Google's Smart Reply feature was found to have been responsible for up to 10 percent of email responses sent from mobile devices earlier this year. It's not as sophisticated as what RADAR will provide the PA -- but it's just another example of AI becoming more applicable and creeping into our daily lives.   \nJournalists like me aren't exactly mollified by all of the reassurances that the AI will simply be a tool to make our reporting more efficient. That might be the case right now -- but what about the future, when the software becomes more sophisticated? \nAutomation is a major future concern for just about every industry -- and, ya know, capitalism as a whole -- so when the machines finally rise in the not-so-distant-future, at least us lowly journalists might not be the only ones out of work. \nWATCH: This mixed reality room is so trippy it might leave you questioning reality"},"shares":{"twitter":429,"linked_in":153,"facebook":164,"google_plus":5,"total":751},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KdnIeti29UcL_kxqUvVIo7PDWZA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529160%2F76f77256-452f-4117-986b-35d373e7e258.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/m0x-jrOVdx0yBj6qB8AbfjVWdVA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nQV15IF6dKEtu2p3GSsFF0sL4J0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ss0UN1FC6Nvrjqu11y4l9a9uaQo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cx5a3h-g8Okc03V6B4gNpugrwz0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_aZG9zKnbxqPCd49G8ns2GXP-Rs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50777%2Fe7396745-3377-4eee-88cd-ac95c195a0b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2u0ggIL","display_title":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xL0X5NJnKE","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"This story would've been so much better if AI wrote it...","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Journalists, look out: Google is funding the rise of the AI news machine in Europe"},{"_id":"595f6d3528cc3667b0000979","id":"2017/07/07/google-assistant-app","title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","title_tag":null,"author":"Michael Nuñez","post_date":"2017-07-07T11:15:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 11:15:00 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"708","sort_key":"1Dtsup","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/google-assistant-app/","content":{"plain":"Let’s face it: Most voice assistants are still too dumb be useful in everyday life. Siri is an abomination, and even Alexa can’t answer some of the most basic questions that I ask. Luckily for me, Google Assistant has gotten ridiculously smart in the past year, and it's legitimately changed my life since I've started using it.\nSEE ALSO: Hey, Siri, Google Assistant is coming to the iPhone — and it's getting smarter\nGoogle Assistant wasn't always great, and it wasn't even widely available until recently. When the search giant launched its artificially intelligent assistant back in May 2016, it was exclusively available for the company's own Pixel phone. \nGoogle didn’t even give other Android phone makers like Samsung and LG access to the app. If you didn't have a Pixel phone, you were simply out of luck.\nBut things finally changed for the better about a month ago. This May at Google I/O, the company finally announced it was releasing the app on Android’s chief rival, iOS. \nSafe to say most iPhone fans didn’t notice or hated the experience. Our very own reporter Karissa Bell detailed the ridiculous issues she faced when using the app shortly after launch. Even my first few experiences testing the app were grim -- but I vowed to check back in every week or so to see if I could find new uses for it. What I've learned in the ensuing month is that Google Assistant for iOS is practically the only app I need.\nGoogle Assistant has straight up improved my quality of life. The first time I discovered just how useful it could be, I was riding my bike. It was pretty late, and I may or may not have had some adult beverages, and I was trying to navigate an unfamiliar part of Brooklyn. I remember belligerently opening the app and asking, \"How do i get home?\"\nThe app heroically pulled up directions to my apartment across town, and with the push of a button, it launched Google Maps, and I was soon biking in the right direction, safely in my own bike lane. Phew. Huge save by the assistant.\nSEE ALSO: Google's likely ditching HTC for LG when it comes to the next Pixel\nThen it saved me in a pinch again. The second time it was earlier in the morning, and I was running behind schedule as I got ready. I asked my phone what was on my calendar, and pulled up a preview of my events with -- crucially -- with the locations of each of the events.\nOne of the events happened to be a fancier outing for my gaudy friend who was throwing himself a birthday. The evening was starting at a hotel bar. Woof. Not only was I surprised, I had to change and basically revaluate my plans for the day. No bag. No sneakers. Another crucial save chalked up to Google Assistant.\nThat's when I was sold.\nThe reality is that these apps are made for people who are completely disorganized, overwhelmed with the realities of being an adult, and need constant prodding to stay on course. They're for weaklings -- and unfortunately, I fall right into that target demographic. I can't say it's the best looking or most fun app that I use, but it's finally starting to work exactly as its designers intended. It helps me course-correct, and for that reason, it's my new favorite app on the iPhone.\nWATCH: This Japanese home assistant is a holographic girl that lives in a jar"},"shares":{"facebook":276,"google_plus":14,"linked_in":42,"twitter":376,"total":708},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8iL6EEX1nl_Uos-Ps4ZgaWMFSYw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528698%2Ffe5cd430-3ea8-429b-b19f-fb134bb42f92.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6BzGVUUn0cFyAmmggiUUjmXhPyY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5zVyf_I1_0DR9jKMrRgekcKaWOE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/57MKciDsXgdoqVOOeS9v4KSUgu0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qcCyTNSy_4kzEOXtRX2Lqo2tS4Y=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CXYRtuDyQ_Ao1NPErwbGey-QVHQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50724%2F029bbe62-26e4-4c3a-a5a3-20ba32925a5b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tTFqbd","display_title":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"OBlPB920Xe","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Google Assistant is my co-pilot.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How Google Assistant saved me from my own messy life"},{"_id":"595b6812f11b2c72ce001f13","id":"2017/07/04/nasdaq-error-123-47","title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","title_tag":null,"author":"Stan Schroeder","post_date":"2017-07-04T10:02:26+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 10:02:26 +0000","formatted_date":"07/04/2017","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1DsGtG","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/04/nasdaq-error-123-47/","content":{"plain":"For one moment on Monday afternoon, the prices of several stocks on Nasdaq -- including those of Amazon, Apple, eBay, Google, and Microsoft -- were all priced exactly the same, $123.47.\nObviously, this couldn't be correct; it would mean a sudden, massive drop in value for Amazon and Google and a huge increase in value for Microsoft and eBay. If it were true, Google's market cap would fall from $623 billion to about $83 billion, while Microsoft's market cap would be propelled to nearly $1 trillion. \nSEE ALSO: New York Times is using Google’s AI to expand online comments\nThe odd occurrence was caused by a data glitch, the Financial Times reported late Monday, that affected only some of the stocks listed on Nasdaq. While the stock prices remained unaltered on Nasdaq itself, third-party services such as Google Finance and Bloomberg displayed the erroneous $123.47 price for a while.  \nStock market API erroneously publishing 123.47 stock quotes for Amazon, eBay, Apple, MSFT and others. #infosec #nyse #nasdaq pic.twitter.com/jK2FG3E1VR— Robb Ware (@robbware) July 4, 2017\n\nAccording to a statement from Nasdaq, the error occurred after \"certain third parties improperly propagated test data that was distributed as part of the normal evening test procedures.\"\nWhile temporary, the glitch was scary, and reminiscent of the 2010 flash crash, in which major U.S. stock indexes, including Nasdaq, collapsed within minutes, erasing trillions of dollars of value before quickly rebounding. That, however, was a far more dangerous occurrence, as the stock prices really did plummet due to a combination of market manipulations and automated high-frequency trading tools which initiated a selling frenzy. \nMonday's glitch was different. Despite sporadic claims of some trades being made at the $123.47 price, Nasdaq told the FT that it did not affect market trading. The biggest consequences appear to be a bit of confusion among traders and a fun day for companies like Sears and Zynga, who saw their stock prices suddenly jump by a few thousand percent. \nWATCH: The future of selfies is this camera drone with facial recognition"},"shares":{"linked_in":513,"twitter":381,"google_plus":10,"facebook":227,"pinterest":1,"total":1132},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HD5cr-AeSEj3-VYrtBbyxGY5anY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F526213%2F7ca4c779-f75b-4336-b871-a7f8979fa0fc.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ilyz0EZDCaA2B75IRrVGUlkptVs=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RLoWJmGA8pwiV_Ma6sNf_UcXxVU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xc8LsWxC-AUY2bOq_ogzL5PNx7M=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tDhi3bArj6aoFDOxhEipPuJczgM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/shF4UqFEfSkyjOdZy5V5qb4BlCc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50473%2Fa7416fbc-599a-4737-ab35-c1f7f58b3e2a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ukMNq5","display_title":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"R6k01Z9nVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"An odd glitch Monday caused the stock prices of several companies listed on Nasdaq to be exactly the same: $123.47.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google, Apple, and Microsoft stocks were all priced $123.47 in one very weird moment Monday"},{"_id":"595a2c5b28cc365992000c4d","id":"2017/07/03/cv-google-autocomplete","title":"Dude uses Google Autocomplete to help him fill out resumé, will definitely never get a job","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2017-07-03T11:36:57+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 03 Jul 2017 11:36:57 +0000","formatted_date":"07/03/2017","formatted_shares":"1.5k","sort_key":"1Ds9S3","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/03/cv-google-autocomplete/","content":{"plain":"Writing your CV is one of life's necessary -- but highly time-consuming -- evils.

The YouTube app was created by Apple with little input from the YouTube team, which limited the video viewing experience, much to the chagrin of iOS users resorting to their mobile browser to watch video content on the platform.  \nThat changed in 2012 with the introduction of iOS 6, which launched without the Apple-built YouTube app for the first time, after Google didn't renew its license. This allowed Google to bring its own fully realized version of YouTube to the App Store, but also meant that YouTube was no longer a default app on the phone.\nSEE ALSO: The deadly escalation of prank videos on YouTube\nAt the time, it wasn't exactly clear why the split happened. My colleague Chris Taylor, who hated the Apple video player, guessed it was the result of Apple distancing itself from its rival, as it was the same year Maps came as part of the OS, too. \nNow, almost five years later we have an inside look at what went down with the split. \nHunter Walk, a notable venture capitalist who was on the YouTube team back in the early days of the iPhone, shed a little more light on the story via tweetstorm, which was spotted by Business Insider.

The rental-car companies introduce a new intermediary between the companies building the autonomous systems and the riders of the fleets of autonomous cars that will eventually take over the roads.\nSEE ALSO: New video reveals the complex way a self-driving car \"sees\" the world\nLet's take a look at what we know about both projects and how the rental car companies fit into the larger self-driving car development landscape. \nWaymo and Avis\n\nThe Waymo-Avis partnership isn't about the development of Waymo's self-driving platform -- at least not at the start. \nAvis will instead provide fleet management, servicing, and maintenance support for Waymo's 600-strong fleet of autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans as part of its public pilot program in Phoenix.  Waymo's vans will depend on Avis service centers for routine car maintenance -- think interior and exterior cleaning, oil changes, and tire rotations -- and for parking while they're not on the road.\nWaymo will still own the vans, and Avis' workers won't actually be touching the autonomous tech, just the cars. The partnership is more of a traditional custodial service than an exploratory effort, keeping Waymo's cars road-ready rather than advancing the program's potential. \nBut there's could be more on the horizon when Waymo's self-driving system expands beyond the Pacifica fleet. The agreement gives Waymo another partner with the essential components it will need for its platform as it matures: access to the existing infrastructure that supports the car industry. Avis also brings to the table its Zipcar services for short-term car rentals.  \nWaymo CEO John Krafcik acknowledged the potential for a future expansion of the partnership to  Bloomberg following the deal's announcement. \"One of the wonderful things about partnerships like this is that they are open,\" he said.   \nApple and Hertz\nApple's reported association with Hertz isn't even close to being on the same level as Waymo's deal with Avis -- but it's still a notable development because of the immediate market response to the news.  \nThe initial report about a potential pairing stemmed from little more than newly-released California DMV documents that named Hertz-owned fleet management unit Donlen as the lessor of the Lexus RX450h SUVs Apple is using to test its autonomous driving platform. \nNo other details about any more substantial aspects to the deal or a potential Apple-Hertz partnership have been reported, although most coverage following Waymo's deal with Avis have conflated the two as being similarly structured. \nApple reps declined to comment about any potential agreements between the two companies, and Hertz reps had no comment when asked for clarification via email.\nBut rumors about a link to Cupertino, no matter how tenuous, have still paid off for Hertz. The rental car company's stock spiked following the disclosure, according to Bloomberg, rising at its highest rate since July 2015. \nThe road ahead\nSeeing rental car-companies entering the self-driving car scene bolsters one of the most obvious trends in the space: the automakers, tech companies, and the other assorted players won't make it to the finish line if they try to develop their systems alone. Partnerships and acquisitions are the key to creating the best autonomous system, with billions of dollars on the line. \nMost of the deals are focused on developing the tech that will control the vehicles, but rental-car companies could have a significant role to play as driverless cars speed forward. Removing the need for a human driver doesn't take people out of the cars of the future, and if private car ownership is phased out by fleets of self-driving vehicles in the urban spaces of the future, someone needs to keep them up and running. \nRental-car companies, with their massive fleets, extant infrastructure, and established reputations with customers are tailor-made to fill the role, possibly even more than ride-hailing companies like Lyft, which has also partnered with Waymo. Car rental is just another branch of the automotive industry on the verge of disruption by self-driving cars -- so like everyone else, it's pivoting before being left in the dust.\nWATCH: Take your summer picnics to the next level with this portable grill"},"shares":{"twitter":267,"facebook":62,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":548,"pinterest":1,"total":890},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1y12jlsbnX3bpSSwqYXhyAXj7Bc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F520299%2F22cdaf3a-0c1f-4293-a771-27991c3ab16b.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wAFWedg3ryOK_y0gdNVL1CfsM8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49911%2Fb3a1894f-02ea-4f9e-be5f-82781c1e4bb5.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JWGcHTA7X7s57N7XTL5z6TX9LDE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49911%2Fb3a1894f-02ea-4f9e-be5f-82781c1e4bb5.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/br73NUmMoUVLMkp6Mha7FZCxBE8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49911%2Fb3a1894f-02ea-4f9e-be5f-82781c1e4bb5.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/r-XPUbJcd53hIyHe617fgvq3GFM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49911%2Fb3a1894f-02ea-4f9e-be5f-82781c1e4bb5.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6V7QK-mh_NAGvvGyQ0EfL5kJPtA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49911%2Fb3a1894f-02ea-4f9e-be5f-82781c1e4bb5.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2siYXNN","display_title":"Car rental companies are nervous about driverless cars, so they're doing something about it","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"VgobGN10NY","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Car-rental companies don't just want to be passengers in the self-driving car race.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Car rental companies are nervous about driverless cars, so they're doing something about it"},{"_id":"59523025f11b2c23eb000778","id":"2017/06/27/google-eu-fine-shopping-service","title":"Google slammed with record $2.7 billion fine from EU","title_tag":null,"author":"Gianluca Mezzofiore","post_date":"2017-06-27T10:14:16+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 10:14:16 +0000","formatted_date":"06/27/2017","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1DpQca","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/27/google-eu-fine-shopping-service/","content":{"plain":"Bad news for Google. \nSEE ALSO: New York Times is using Google’s AI to expand online comments\nThe European Commission has fined the tech giant a record €2.42 billion ($2.72 billion; £2.13 billion) for \"abusing dominance as search engine\" by promoting its own shopping comparison service over others. \nIt's a massive fine that could mark a turning point for how governments regulate increasingly dominant tech companies. The emergence of Google along with other companies like Facebook and Amazon have begun to cause concern about their market power. \nThe fine comes from Europe but many of the complaints come from American companies that have claimed that Google's search engine did not play fair when people looked for products.\nWhile some welcomed the fine, others in the tech community felt the EU had overstepped—particularly with the amount of the fine.\nHell, Google's shopping service isn't worth $2.7 billion. 2/— Jeff Jarvis (@jeffjarvis) June 27, 2017\n\nGoogle is a popular target for the European Commission, which is also investigating the company's practices with two other big products: AdSense and its Android mobile operating system.\nBut it's not just Google. Facebook was recently on the business end of a $122 million fine over what the European Commission claimed was misleading information related to the acquisition of WhatsApp.\nThe ruling also puts a 90-day deadline for Google to end its anti-competitive practices or risk paying up to 5% of the average daily worldwide turnover of Alphabet, Google's parent company. \n\"Google has come up with many innovative products and services that have made a difference to our lives,\" Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.\n\"That's a good thing. But Google's strategy for its comparison shopping service wasn't just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals.\"\n\"Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine by promoting its own comparison shopping service in its search results, and demoting those of competitors,\" she added. \n\"What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\"\nGoogle has said it will appeal. \n\"When you shop online, you want to find the products you're looking for quickly and easily,\" a spokesman said after the ruling.\n\"And advertisers want to promote those same products. That's why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both.\"\n\"We respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today. We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case.\"\nEurope's willingness to go after tech companies with investigations into competitive practices is particularly stark as U.S. regulators have remained quiet on these issues—a topic that is becoming the source of growing critique.\nAnd American antitrust regulators know they look stupid.

The search giant has never shown those customers ads or skimmed their emails as it does with its free Gmail service, but some were confused about that point, according to Google Cloud SVP Diane Greene.\n\"This decision brings Gmail ads in line with how we personalize ads for other Google products,\" Greene wrote in a blog post. \nSEE ALSO: Facebook and Google are destroying bad online ads, which is great until they own the world\nUsers of free Gmail will still see ads in the form of promoted messages, but they will only be targeted based on data Google's collected on you through other avenues, like search history and YouTube activity. Given Google's massive reach, the company no doubt has more than enough information with which to personalize ads without digging through inboxes.  \nThe move comes as Google is investing heavily in cloud computing and its G-Suite software package—which includes enterprise Gmail—in a bid to catch up with companies like Microsoft and Amazon. That this announcement came from the company's cloud department rather than its ads people suggests that customer privacy concerns may have been making it harder to enlist new corporate customers on this front. \nGoogle has used the contents of user emails to direct ads since just after Gmail's inception, and it expanded its intake to encompass entire inboxes in 2011. The program has drawn criticism from consumer advocacy groups as well as multiple lawsuits.\nGoogle doesn't break out a standalone revenue figure for Gmail, but historically, it's never been a huge moneymaker. Rather, the free tier's primary business purpose has been to bait customers into its more lucrative enterprise platforms. That means the priorities of the latter arm come first.\nThankfully, Google still lets you disable personalized ads through its settings tab.\nWATCH: Google Glass for autistic kids \n "},"shares":{"facebook":296,"twitter":879,"google_plus":16,"linked_in":373,"pinterest":2,"total":1566},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2mrUwZMFy-gqlO7og16fdXGif7M=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F517385%2F5c17fd0b-1303-4583-9a86-82c232ab64f1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/937VHKmIh6iubVLLQsvM_X_BNCA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49628%2Fa150a419-9148-4b71-b8bc-78170cb17f66.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bvTeJa6yg2bNv3bC4lj0mhfrkLY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49628%2Fa150a419-9148-4b71-b8bc-78170cb17f66.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nDqgHQDxTZg56N08-SGLKIVPR7U=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49628%2Fa150a419-9148-4b71-b8bc-78170cb17f66.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ykXagEd92S2A4tNWnvSnA44kJ8o=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49628%2Fa150a419-9148-4b71-b8bc-78170cb17f66.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cblZG_q4NUtrXyAYEAEIxhwmpnw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49628%2Fa150a419-9148-4b71-b8bc-78170cb17f66.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tCDAZR","display_title":"Google promises to stop digging through your email inbox to target ads (which it was totally doing)","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"qeGlvzylkX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The practice was confusing its corporate customers.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Google promises to stop digging through your email inbox to target ads (which it was totally doing)"}]
