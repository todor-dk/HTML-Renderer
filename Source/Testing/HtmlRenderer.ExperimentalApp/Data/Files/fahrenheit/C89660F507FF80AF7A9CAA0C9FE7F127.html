<li>It was a pleasure to burn.
<ul>
<li>p. 1 (opening line)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm seventeen and I'm crazy. My uncle says the two always go together. When people ask your age, he said, always say seventeen and insane.(7)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Then she seemed to remember something and came back to look at him with wonder and curiosity. "Are you happy?" she said. (7)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Monday burn <a href="/wiki/Edna_St._Vincent_Millay" title="Edna St. Vincent Millay">Millay</a>, Wednesday <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman" title="Walt Whitman">Whitman</a>, Friday <a href="/wiki/William_Faulkner" title="William Faulkner">Faulkner</a>, burn 'em to ashes, then burn the ashes. That's our official slogan. (8)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>"Do you ever <i>read</i> any of the books you burn?"<br />
He laughed. "That's against the law!"<br />
"Oh. Of course."</b> (5)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>You're not like the others. I've seen a few; I <i>know</i>. When I talk, you look at me.</b> When I said something about the moon, you looked at the moon, last night. The others would never do that. The others would walk off and leave me talking. Or threaten me. <b>No one has time any more for anyone else.</b> You're one of the few who put up with me. That's why I think it's so strange you're a fireman. It just doesn't seem right for you, somehow.'"(23-24)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>I sometimes think drivers don’t know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly.</b> If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! he’d say, that’s grass! A pink blur! That’s a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove forty miles per hour and they jailed him for two days. Isn’t that funny, and sad, too? <b>(9)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"That's sad," said Montag, quietly,(referring to The Hound) "because all we put into it is hunting and finding and killing. What a shame if that's all it can ever know."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They crashed the front door and grabbed at a woman, though she was not running, she was not trying to escape. She was only standing, weaving from side to side, her eyes fixed upon a nothingness in the wall as if they had struck her a terrible blow upon the head. <b>Her tongue was moving in her mouth, and her eyes seemed to be trying to remember something, and then they remembered and her tongue moved again:<br />
<i>"Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out."</i></b>
<ul>
<li>This is a quotation of <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Latimer" title="Hugh Latimer">Hugh Latimer</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ridley_(martyr)" class="extiw" title="w:Nicholas Ridley (martyr)">Nicholas Ridley</a> as they were about to be burned at the stake as heretics during the reign of "Bloody Mary", Queen Mary I of England, at Oxford, on October 16, 1555.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>How inconvenient! Always before it had been like snuffing a candle. The police went first and adhesive-taped the victim's mouth and bandaged him off into their glittering beetle cars, so when you arrived you found an empty house. You weren't hurting anyone, you were hurting only things! And since things really couldn't be hurt, since things felt nothing, and things don't scream or whimper, as this woman might begin to scream and cry out, there was nothing to tease your conscience later. You were simply cleaning up. Janitorial work, essentially. Everything to its proper place. Quick with the kerosene! Who's got a match?</b> (36)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>So it was the hand that started it all. He felt one hand and then the other work his coat free and let it slump to the floor. He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness. His hands had been infected, and soon it would be his arms. He could feel the poison working up his wrists and into his elbows and his shoulders and then jump over from shoulder blade to shoulder blade like a spark leaping a gap. His hands were ravenous. And his eyes were beginning to feel hunger as if they must look at something, anything, everything.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>She's nothing to me; she shouldn't have had books. It was her responsibility, she should have thought of that. I hate her. She's got you going and next thing you know we'll be out, no house, no job, nothing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Let you alone! That's all very well, but how can I leave myself alone? <b>We need not to be let alone. We need to be really <i>bothered</i> once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something <i>real?</i></b>(52)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bigger the population, the more minorities. Don't step on the toes of the dog lovers, the cat lovers, doctors, lawyers, merchants, chiefs, Mormons, Baptists, Unitarians, second-generation Chinese, Swedes, Italians, Germans, Texans, Brooklynites, Irishmen, people from Oregon or Mexico. The people in this book, this play, this TV serial are not meant to represent any actual painters, cartographers, mechanics anywhere. The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that!... Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did.</b>(54)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Many were those whose sole knowledge of <i>Hamlet</i> (you know the title certainly, Montag; it is probably only a faint rumor of a title to you, Mrs. Montag) whose sole knowledge, as I say, of Hamlet was a one-page digest in a book that claimed: 'Now at least you can read all the classics; keep up with your neighbors.' Do you see? Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>School is shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories, languages dropped, English and spelling gradually gradually neglected, finally almost completely ignored. Life is immediate, the job counts, pleasure lies all about after work. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts?</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word `intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be. You always dread the unfamiliar.</b> (page 58)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone <i>made</i> equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. <b>Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man?</b> Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. (56)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People want to be happy, isn't that right? Haven't you heard it all your life? I want to be happy, people say. Well, aren't they? Don't we keep them moving, don't we give them fun? That's all we live for, isn't it? For pleasure, for titillation? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these. (59)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Colored people don't like <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Black_Sambo" class="extiw" title="w:Little Black Sambo">Little Black Sambo</a></i>. Burn it. White people don't feel good about <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin" class="extiw" title="w:Uncle Tom's Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></i>. Burn it. (59)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>She didn't want to know how a thing was done, but <i>why</i>. That can be embarrassing. You ask <i>Why</i> to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed, if you keep at it. The poor girl's better off dead. (60)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>'<b><i>You can't build a house without nails and wood. If you don't want a house built, hide the nails and wood.'</i> If you don't want a man unhappy politically, don't give him two sides to a question to worry him; give him one. Better yet, give him none. Let him forget there is such a thing as war.</b> (61)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. <b>Cram them full of non-combustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information.</b> Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. Any man who can take a TV wall apart and put it back together again, and most men can nowadays, is happier than any man who tries to slide rule, measure, and equate the universe, <b>which just won't be measured or equated without making man feel bestial and lonely.</b> I know, I've tried it; to hell with it.(61)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I hope I've clarified things. The important thing for you to remember, Montag, is we're the Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others. We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought. We have our fingers in the dike. Hold steady. Don't let the torrent of melancholy and drear philosophy drown our world. We depend on you. I don't think you realize how important you are, to our happy world as it stands now.(61-62)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At least once in his career, every fireman gets an itch. What do the books say, he wonders. Oh, to scratch that itch, eh? Well, Montag, take my word for it, I've had to read a few in my time, to know what I was about, and the books say <i>nothing!</i> Nothing you can teach or believe. They're about nonexistent people, figments of imagination, if they're fiction. And if they're non-fiction, it's worse, one professor calling another an idiot, one philosopher screaming down another's gullet. <b>All of them running about, putting out the stars and extinguishing the sun. You come away lost.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>And if there is something here, just one little thing out of a whole mess of things, maybe we can pass it on to someone else.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That woman, the other night, Millie, you weren't there. You didn't see her face. And Clarisse. You never talked to her. I talked to her. And men like Beatty are afraid of her. I can't understand it. Why should they be so afraid of someone like her? But I kept putting her alongside the firemen in the house last night, and I suddenly realized I didn't like them at all, and I didn't like myself at all any more.(67)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Montag picked a single small volume from the floor. "Where do we begin?" He opened the book halfway and peered at it. "We begin by beginning, I guess." (68)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>We have everything we need to be happy, but we aren't happy. Something's missing.</b> I looked around. The only thing I positively knew was gone was the books I'd burned in ten or twelve years. So I thought books might help.(78)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget.</b> There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us. Of course you couldn't know this, of course you still can't understand what I mean when I say all this.(82)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.(83)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you know the legend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules" class="extiw" title="w:Hercules">Hercules</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antaeus" class="extiw" title="w:Antaeus">Antaeus</a>, the giant wrestler, whose strength was incredible so long as he stood firmly on the earth. But when he was held, rootless, in mid-air, by Hercules, he perished easily. If there isn't something in that legend for us today, in this city, in our time, then I am completely insane.(83)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>After all, when we <i>had</i> all the books we needed, we still insisted on finding the highest cliff to jump off. But we <i>do</i> need knowledge. And perhaps in a thousand years we might pick smaller cliffs to jump off. (86)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are. They're Caesar's praetorian guard, whispering as the parade roars down the avenue, 'Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal.' Most of us can't rush around, talk to everyone, know all the cities of the world, we haven't time, money or that many friends. The things you're looking for, Montag, are in the world, but the only way the average chap will ever see ninety-nine per cent of them is in a book. Don't ask for guarantees. And don't look to be saved in any one thing, person, machine, or library. Do your own bit of saving, and if you drown, at least die knowing you were headed for shore.(86)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Remember the firemen are rarely necessary. The public stopped reading of its own accord.</b> You firemen provide a circus now and then at which buildings are set off and crowds gather for the pretty blaze, but its a small sideshow indeed, and hardly necessary to keep things in line. <b>So few want to be rebels anymore.</b> And out of those few, most, like myself, scare easily. Can you dance faster than the White Clown, shout louder than 'Mr. Gimmick' and the parlor 'families'? If you can, you'll win your way, Montag. In any event, you’re a fool. People are having <i>fun</i>.(87)
<ul>
<li>Faber to Montag</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Those who don't build must burn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Out of two separate and opposite things, a third. <b>And one day he would look back upon the fool and know the fool.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If there were no war, if there was peace in the world, I'd say fine, have fun! But, Montag, you mustn't go back to being just a fireman. All isn't well with the world.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>You're afraid of making mistakes. Don't be.</b> Mistakes can be profited by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in people's faces. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me. <b>If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Who are a little wise, the best fools be." Welcome back, Montag.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Go home and think of your first husband divorced and your second husband killed in a jet and your third husband blowing his brains out, go home and think of the dozen abortions you’ve had, go home and think of that and your damn Caesarian sections, too, and your children who hate your guts! Go home and think how it all happened and what did you ever do to stop it?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God. Today, thanks to them, you can stay happy all the time, you are allowed to read comics, the good old confessions, or trade journals.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do you know, I had a dream an hour ago. I lay down for a cat-nap and in this dream you and I, Montag, got into a furious debate on books. You towered with rage, yelled quotes at me. I calmly parried every thrust. Power, I said, And you, quoting Dr. Johnson, said `Knowledge is more than equivalent to force!' And I said, `Well, Dr. Johnson also said, dear boy, that "He is no wise man that will quit a certainty for an uncertainty.'" Stick with the fireman, Montag. All else is dreary chaos!"...Beatty chuckled. "And you said, quoting, `Truth will come to light, murder will not be hid long!' And I cried in good humour, 'Oh God, he speaks only of his horse!' And `The Devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.' And you yelled, 'This age thinks better of a gilded fool, than of a threadbare saint in wisdom's school!' And I whispered gently, 'The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting.' And you screamed, 'Carcasses bleed at the sight of the murderer!' And I said, patting your hand, 'What, do I give you trench mouth?' And you shrieked, 'Knowledge is power!' and 'A dwarf on a giant's shoulders of the furthest of the two!' and I summed my side up with rare serenity in, 'The folly of mistaking a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself as an oracle, is inborn in us, Mr. Valery once said.'" Montag's head whirled sickeningly. He felt beaten unmercifully on brow, eyes, nose, lips, chin, on shoulders, on upflailing arms..."Oh, you were scared silly," said Beatty, "for I was doing a terrible thing in using the very books you clung to, to rebut you on every hand, on every point! What traitors books can be! You think</li>
</ul>
<p>they're backing you up, and they turn on you. Others can use them, too, and there you are, lost in the middle of the moor, in a great welter of nouns and verbs and adjectives. And at the very end of my dream, along I came with the Salamander and said, Going my way? And you got in and we drove back to the firehouse in beatific silence, all dwindled away to peace." Beatty let Montag's wrist go, let the hand slump limply on the table. <b>"All's well that is well in the end."</b> --Beatty misquoting Shakespeare and others out of context.</p>
<ul>
<li>All right, he's had his say. You must take it in. I'll say my say, too, in the next few hours. And you'll take it in. And you'll try to judge them and make your decision as to which way to jump, or fall. But <b>I want it to be your decision, not mine, and not the Captain's.</b> But remember that <b>the Captain belongs to the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom, the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I paid for all this — how? <b>Playing the stock-market, of course, the last refuge in the world for the dangerous intellectual out of a job</b>.(90)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This is happening to <i>me</i>. "What a dreadful surprise," said Beatty. "For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is certain, that nothing will ever happen to me. Others die, I go on. There are no consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there are. But let's not talk about them, eh? By the time the consequences catch up with you, it's too late, isn't it, Montag?" (115)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It was pretty silly, quoting poetry around free and easy like that. It was the act of a silly snob. Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks he's the Lord of all Creation. You think you can walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by just fine without them. Look where they got you, in slime up to your lip. If I stir the slime with my little finger, you'll drown! (117-118)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>We never burned <i>right</i>...</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They would have killed me, thought Montag, swaying, the air still torn and stirring about him in dust, touching his bruised cheek. <b>For no reason at all in the world they would have killed me.</b>(122)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Would he have time for a speech? As the Hound seized him, in view of ten or twenty or thirty million people, mightn't he sum up his entire life in the last week in one single phrase or a word that would stay with them long after the Hound had turned, clenching him in its metal-plier jaws, and trotted off in darkness, while the camera remained stationary, watching the creature dwindle in the distance— a splendid fade-out! <b>What could he say in a single word, a few words, that would sear all their faces and wake them up?</b>(128):<i>"Are you happy?"</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With an effort, Montag reminded himself again that this was no fictional episode to be watched on his run to the river; it was in actuality his own chess-game he was witnessing, move by move.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Police suggest entire population in the Elm Terrace area do as follows: Everyone in every house in every street open a front or rear door or look from the windows. The fugitive cannot escape if everyone in the next minute looks from his house. Ready! "<br />
Of course! Why hadn't they done it before! Why, in all the years, hadn't this game been tried! Everyone up, everyone out! He couldn't be missed! The only man running alone in the night city, the only man proving his legs!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time. The world rushed in a circle and turned on its axis and time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen, and the sun burnt Time, that meant everything burnt!</b> (141)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Somewhere the saving and putting away had to begin again and someone had to do the saving and keeping, one way or another, in books, in records, in people's heads, any way at all so long as it was safe, free from moths, silver-fish, rust and dry-rot, and men with matches.</b> (141)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>He walked on the track.<br />
And he was surprised to learn how certain he suddenly was of a single fact he could not prove.<br />
Once, long ago, Clarisse had walked here, where he was walking now.</b> (145)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They're faking. You threw them off at the river. They can't admit it. They know they can hold their audience only so long. The show's got to have a snap ending, quick! If they started searching the whole damn river it might take all night. So they're sniffing for a scape-goat to end things with a bang. Watch. They'll catch Montag in the next five minutes! (148)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right now, some poor fellow is out for a walk. A rarity. An odd one. Don't think the police don't know the habits of queer ducks like that, men who walk mornings for the hell of it, or for reasons of insomnia. Anyway, the police have had him charted for months, years. Never know when that sort of information might be handy. And today, it turns out, it's very usable indeed. It saves face. (148)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Walk carefully. Guard your health. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of Ecclesiastes. (151)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I want you to meet Jonathan Swift, the author of that evil political book, <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>! And this other fellow is Charles Darwin, and this one is Schopenhauer, and this one is Einstein, and this one here at my elbow is Mr. Albert Schweitzer, a very kind philosopher indeed. Here we all are, Montag. Aristophanes and Mahatma Gandhi and Gautama Buddha and Confucius and Thomas Love Peacock and Thomas Jefferson and Mr. Lincoln, if you please. We are also Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Right now we have a horrible job; we're waiting for the war to begin and, as quickly, end. It's not pleasant, but then we're not in control, we're the odd minority crying in the wilderness. When the war's over, perhaps we can be of some use in the world."... We'll pass the books on to our children, by word of mouth, and let our children wait, in turn, on the other people. A lot will be lost that way, of course. <b>But you can't <i>make</i> people listen.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Montag turned and glanced back.</li>
</ul>
<p>What did you give to the city, Montag? Ashes. What did the others give to each other? Nothingness.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you're there.</b> <b>It doesn't matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away.</b> The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime. <b>(156-157)</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>'<b>I hate a Roman named Status Quo!' he said to me.</b> 'Stuff your eyes with wonder,' he said, 'live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. <b>Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every day, sleeping its life away. To hell with that,' he said, 'shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass.'</b> (157-158)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And the war began and ended in that instant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Montag, falling flat, going down, <b>saw or felt, or imagined he saw or felt the walls go dark in Millie's face, heard her screaming, because in the millionth part of time left, she saw her own face reflected there, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it was such a wildly empty face, all by itself in the room, touching nothing, starved and eating of itself, that at last she recognized it as her own</b> and looked quickly up at the ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in its own unreasonable way.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>I want to see everything now. And while none of it will be me when it goes in, after a while it'll all gather together inside and it'll be me.</b> Look at the world out there, my God, my God, look at it out there, outside me, out there beyond my face and the only way to really touch it is to put it where it's finally me, where it's in the blood, where it pumps around a thousand times ten thousand a day. I get hold of it so it'll never run off. I'll hold on to the world tight some day. I've got one finger on it now; that's a beginning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There was a silly damn bird called a Phoenix back before Christ: every few hundred years he built a pyre and burned himself up. He must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up he sprang out of the ashes, he got himself born all over again. And it looks like we're doing the same thing, over and over, but we've got one damn thing the Phoenix never had. We know the damn silly thing we just did. <b>We know all the damn silly things we've done for a thousand years, and as long as we know that and always have it around where we can see it, some day we'll stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few more people that remember, every generation.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Some day the load we're carrying with us may help someone.</b> But even when we had the books on hand, a long time ago, we didn't use what we got out of them. We went right on insulting the dead. We went right on spitting in the graves of all the poor ones who died before us. <b>We're going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month and the next year. And when they ask us what we're doing, you can say, We're remembering. That's where we'll win out in the long run. And some day we'll remember so much that we'll build the biggest goddamn steamshovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in and cover it up.</b> Come on now, we're going to go build a mirror factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year and take a long look in them." (163-164)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>To everything there is a season. Yes. A time to break down, and a time to build up. Yes. A time to keep silent and a time to speak.</b> Yes, all that. But what else? What else? Something, something . . . <b>And on either side of the river was there a tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month; And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</b></li>
