            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Today, let's look at Fahrenheit's thermometers. The
                University of Houston's College of Engineering
                presents this series about the machines that make
                our civilization run, and the people whose
                ingenuity created them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <font size="+3">D</font>aniel Fahrenheit, the man
                who put thermometry on a solid footing, was born in
                the Polish city of Gdansk in 1686. When he was 15
                his parents both died from eating poisonous
                mushrooms. The city council put the four younger
                Fahrenheit children in foster homes. But they
                apprenticed Daniel to a merchant, who taught him
                bookkeeping and took him off to Amsterdam.
              </p>
              <p>
                And there he found out about thermometers. The
                Florentine thermometer, invented in Italy some 60
                years before, caught his fancy. So he skipped out
                on his apprenticeship and borrowed against his
                inheritance to take up thermometer making. When the
                city fathers of Gdansk found out, they arranged to
                have the 20-year-old Fahrenheit arrested and
                shipped off to the East India Company. He dodged
                the Dutch police until he became a legal adult at
                the age of 24. At first Fahrenheit had gone on the
                run; but then he continued traveling -- through
                Denmark, Germany, Holland, Sweden, and Poland -- to
                learn and study.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ulrich Grigull, who tells Fahrenheit's story, notes
                that Florentine thermometer scales were quite
                arbitrary. No two were alike. Makers set the low
                point on the scale during the coldest day in
                Florence that year and the high point during the
                hottest day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fahrenheit wanted thermometers to be reproducible.
                He realized that the trick was not to use the
                coldness or hotness of a particular day or place,
                but to find materials that changed at certain
                temperatures. Isaac Newton had had the same idea a
                few years earlier, but he wasn't a professional
                thermometer maker, and he was ignored.
              </p>
              <p>
                Between 1707 and 1714 Fahrenheit worked out an
                alcohol thermometer scale based on three points:
                Zero was freezing point of a salt-water mixture, 32
                degrees was the freezing point of water, and body
                temperature was called 96 degrees. Body temperature
                was a little off in this scale, but it was close.
                In 1714 he startled the world with a pair of
                thermometers that both gave the same readings. No
                one had ever managed to do that. Later he made
                mercury thermometers that let him use the boiling
                point of water instead of the human body
                temperature.
              </p>
              <p>
                The turning points of inventive genius are subtle.
                Fahrenheit made sense of temperature by seeing
                temperature scales in abstract terms. He realized,
                independently of Newton, that the scales must be
                set by universal material properties. But he also
                did what Newton failed to do. He manufactured fine
                thermometers that carried his thinking into the
                world.

                work.
