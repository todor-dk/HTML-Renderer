                                    <p>One of the most controversial and provocative films of the year, Fahrenheit 9/11 is Academy Award-winning filmmaker Michael Moore&#8217;s searing examination of the Bush administration&#8217;s actions in the wake of the tragic events of 9/11.</p>
<p>With his characteristic humor and dogged commitment to uncovering the facts, Moore considers the presidency of George W. Bush and where it has led us. He looks at how &#8211; and why &#8211; Bush and his inner circle avoided pursuing the Saudi connection to 9/11, despite the fact that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis and Saudi money had funded Al Qaeda. Fahrenheit 9/11 shows us a nation kept in constant fear by FBI alerts and lulled into accepting a piece of legislation, the USA Patriot Act, that infringes on basic civil rights. It is in this atmosphere of confusion, suspicion and dread that the Bush Administration makes its headlong rush towards war in Iraq and Fahrenheit 9/11 takes us inside that war to tell the stories we haven&#8217;t heard, illustrating the awful human cost to U.S. soldiers and their families.</p>

            Ten minutes after the top of the hour, network excitement was again beginning to build. At 2:16 a.m., the call was made: Fox News Channel, with Bush&#8217;s first cousin John Ellis running its election desk, was the first to project Florida &#8212; and the presidency &#8212; for the Texas governor. Within minutes, the other networks followed suit. &#8220;George Bush, Governor of Texas will become the 43rd President of the United States,&#8221; CNN&#8217;s Bernard Shaw announced atop a graphic montage of a smiling Bush. &#8220;At 18 minutes past two o&#8217;clock Eastern time, CNN declares that George Walker Bush has won Florida&#8217;s 25 electoral votes and this should put him over the top.&#8221;<br />

            The Florida Department of State awarded a $4 million contract to the Boca Raton-based Database Technologies Inc. (subsidiary of ChoicePoint).  They were tasked with finding improperly registered voters in the state&#8217;s database, but mistakes were rampant. &#8220;At one point, the list included as felons 8,000 former Texas residents who had been convicted of misdemeanors.&#8221; St. Petersburg Times (Florida), December 21, 2003.
          </div>
<div class="response">
            Database Technologies, a subsidiary of ChoicePoint, &#8220;was responsible for bungling an overhaul of Florida&#8217;s voter registration records, with the result that thousands of people, disproportionately black, were disenfranchised in the 2000 election.  Had they been able to vote, they might have swung the state, and thus the presidency, for Al Gore, who lost in Florida.

<div class="response">
            [A] consortium [Tribune Co., owner of the Times; Associated Press; CNN; the New York Times; the Palm Beach Post; the St. Petersburg Times; the Wall Street Journal; and the Washington Post] hired the NORC [National Opinion Research Center, a nonpartisan research organization affiliated with the University of Chicago] to view each untallied ballot and gather information about how it was marked. The media organizations then used computers to sort and tabulate votes, based on varying scenarios that had been raised during the post-election scramble in Florida. Under any standard that tabulated all disputed votes statewide, Mr. Gore erased Mr. Bush&#8217;s advantage and emerged with a tiny lead that ranged from 42 to 171 votes.
