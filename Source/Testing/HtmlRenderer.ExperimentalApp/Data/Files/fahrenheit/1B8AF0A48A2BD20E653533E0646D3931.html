<title>Temperature Scales</title>

There are three temperature scales in use today, Fahrenheit, Celsius and
Kelvin.<p>

Fahrenheit temperature scale is a scale based on 32 for the freezing
point of water and 212 for the boiling point of water, the interval
between the two being divided into 180 parts. The 18th-century German
physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit originally took as the zero of
his scale the temperature of an equal ice-salt mixture and selected
the values of 30 and 90 for the freezing point of water and normal
body temperature, respectively; these later were revised to 32 and
96, but the final scale required an adjustment to 98.6 for the latter
value.<p>

Until the 1970s the Fahrenheit temperature scale was in general
common use in English-speaking countries; the Celsius, or centigrade,
scale was employed in most other countries and for scientific
purposes worldwide. Since that time, however, most English-speaking
countries have officially adopted the Celsius scale. The conversion
formula for a temperature that is expressed on the Celsius (C) scale
to its Fahrenheit (F) representation is: F = 9/5C + 32.<p>

Celsius temperature scale also called centigrade temperature scale,
is the scale based on 0 for the freezing point of water and 100 for
the boiling point of water.  Invented in 1742 by the Swedish
astronomer Anders Celsius, it is sometimes called the centigrade
scale because of the 100-degree interval between the defined points.
The following formula can be used to convert a temperature from its
representation on the Fahrenheit ( F) scale to the Celsius (C) value:
C = 5/9(F - 32). The Celsius scale is in general use wherever metric
units have become accepted, and it is used in scientific work
everywhere.  <p>

Kelvin temperature scale is the base unit of thermodynamic
temperature measurement in the International System (SI) of
measurement. It is defined as 1/ 273.16 of the triple point
(equilibrium among the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases) of pure
water. The kelvin (symbol K without the degree sign []) is also the
fundamental unit of the Kelvin scale, an absolute temperature scale
named for the British physicist William Thomson, Baron Kelvin. Such a
scale has as its zero point absolute zero, the theoretical
temperature at which the molecules of a substance have the lowest
energy. Many physical laws and formulas can be expressed more simply
when an absolute temperature scale is used; accordingly, the Kelvin
scale has been adopted as the international standard for scientific
temperature measurement. The Kelvin scale is related to the Celsius
scale. The difference between the freezing and boiling points of
water is 100 degrees in each, so that the kelvin has the same
magnitude as the degree Celsius.
