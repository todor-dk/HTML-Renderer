    <blockquote><p>"We first approached Fahrenheit a year ago, following a period of rapid growth and change, including the acquisition of another company. We recognized that we needed to build strong internal and external brand awareness. Fahrenheit took the time to get to know our business, our employees and our customers. They helped us develop a unified brand message, an exciting new visual identity, and a clear strategy for moving forward. The rebrand has been a huge success across the board—from employees to customers. It's revived our image as a fun, innovative, and user-friendly company. The message we're sending finally matches the way we see ourselves."</p></blockquote>
