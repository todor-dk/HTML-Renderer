              <p>
                Today, we invent the thermometer. The University of
                Houston's College of Engineering presents this
                series about the machines that make our
                civilization run, and the people whose ingenuity
                created them.
              </p>
              <p>
                <font size="+3">D</font>aniel Fahrenheit, the man
                who put thermometry on a solid footing, was born in
                the Polish city of Gdansk in 1686. He was only
                fifteen when his parents both died from eating
                poisonous mushrooms. The city council put the four
                younger Fahrenheit children in foster homes. But
                they apprenticed Daniel to a merchant, who taught
                him bookkeeping and took him off to Amsterdam.
              </p>
              <p>
                There he found out about thermometers. The
                Florentine thermometer had been invented in Italy
                some sixty years before. Now it showed up as a
                trade item in Amsterdam, and it caught young
                Fahrenheit's fancy. So he skipped out on his
                apprenticeship and borrowed against his inheritance
                to take up thermometer making.
              </p>
              <p>
                When the city fathers of Gdansk found out, they
                arranged to have the 20-year-old Fahrenheit
                arrested and shipped off to the East India Company.
                So he had to dodge Dutch police until he became a
                legal adult at the age of 24. At first he'd simply
                been on the run; but he kept traveling -- through
                Denmark, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Poland. He
                studied and learned.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ulrich Grigull, who tells Fahrenheit's story,
                points out that Florentine thermometer scales were
                quite arbitrary. No two were alike. Makers marked
                the low point on the scale during the coldest day
                in Florence that year. They marked the high point
                during the hottest day. Fahrenheit wanted
                thermometers to be reproducible. He realized the
                trick wasn't using the coldness or hotness of a
                particular day or place, but finding materials that
                changed at certain temperatures. Isaac Newton had
                had the same idea a few years earlier, but he
                wasn't a thermometer-maker. His idea stayed in
                books.
              </p>
              <p>
                For seven years Fahrenheit worked out an alcohol
                thermometer scale based on three points. He chose
                the freezing point of a certain salt-water mixture
                for zero. He used the freezing point of water for
                32 degrees. And body temperature he called 96
                degrees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why the funny numbers? He originally used a
                twelve-point scale with zero, four, and twelve for
                those three benchmarks. Then he put eight
                gradations in each large division. That's how he
                got that strange 96 number -- it was eight times
                twelve. Body temperature is actually a tad higher
                than 96, but it was close. Later, Fahrenheit made
                mercury thermometers that let him use the boiling
                point of water instead of human body temperature
                for the high mark.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fahrenheit was still only 28 when he startled the
                world by making a pair of thermometers that both
                gave the same readings. No one had ever done that
                before. The turning points of inventive genius are
                subtle. Fahrenheit made sense of temperature by
                seeing temperature scales in abstract terms. He
                realized, independently of Newton, that scales
                could be wed to universal material properties. But
                he also did what Newton failed to do. He built fine
                thermometers, and they carried his thinking into
                the world.

                work.
