                <h2>More Fun With our Clash of Clans Hack</h2>
        
        <p>The best mobile game available on the market focuses on strategical player versus player combat where <a href="resources.html" title="Resources">resources</a> are finite, and you are required to raid other player's bases called "village's". You are also required to build an army of your own troops with which you can raid other people's.</p>
		
		<p>You might ask what do you gain from raiding other players? Every time you raid someone and win you loot their base for the resources, but beware other people want to do it the same thing to you - there is literally no single player unless you buy thing called shield which gives you.. well shield and immune to other player's attacks.</p>

        <p>The game is free of charge, but as it always is it comes with a price, everytime you build something you have to wait certain time. On higher levels when you upgrade let's say for example your base you sometimes have to wait even 7 days for base to finish building.</p>

        <p>But with the in-game purchases you are able to buy thing's called "Gems". With these gems you are able to speed things up - it means you would be able to finish your base not in 7 days but in 5 seconds - of course the more you have to wait the more you would have to pay in gems currency.</p>

          <div class="col_3 clear"></div>
        </div>       

        <p>The game starts real slow for you, you won't even get a chance at building big army simply because you lack required buildings, but as the time goes and you upgrade your base, you get more buildings and things start catching up until you come to certain level where you will simply be stuck in place cause of players raiding your base.</p>

        <p>There are few solutions to that, at certain level players tends to use same strategy over and over again, you have two options either upgrade your walls which you won't have money for it - that's why you need coc gems or simply change the layout defense of your base - it will help of course if you have upgraded defenses such as turrets, but I guarantee you - you won't have money to do so.</p>

        <p>What makes this game so popular that there are 40mln players playing it every month? I think it's that game competitiveness and it's so easy to get addicted to it.</p>

        <p>If you don't want to wait for everything to finish building, or you want resources, or even if you don't have the money to purchase the gems directly from the store you have only one solution... and that is our gems generator.</p>

        <h2>With our Hack Tool You Will Become One of The Best Players</h2>

        <p>You might ask how is this tool gonna help me? Well.. it will help you a lot - with it you are able to generate unlimited amount of coc resources along with the most expensive of its currency... the gems!</p>

        <p>Yes you read it right, you can generate gems directly for your village on our site, and most importantly it is safe for your village. Let me explain you a few things.</p>

        <p>Once you use our hack tool and generate yourself any amount of gems or gold or elixir doesn't matter - the resources will be then stored on our server side behind our secure line and what we do is simply put them to your village through various algorithms.</p>

        <p>Why you should use it? Because it will save you weeks of building even months! And most importantly you are able to get standard resources with it like gold or even dark elixir!</p>

        <p>But beware this doesn't grant you any god mode or anything like that, you will still be vulnerable to other players and your village can still get destroyed like everybody's else. It can be harsh sometimes getting raided 10 times in a row and losing all the battles and your hard earned resources.. and that's mostly losing to people who been playing this game for longer than you and you simply don't stand a chance..</p>

        <p>Then why bother? Get fun with our hack tool! Why you should get raided by stronger players when you also can become a competitive player.</p>

All kind of games are about fun which is forgotten now a days.. and with barricade which is gems you won't get fun unless you buy it or generate it yourself. If you are asking yourself how we made it? Well we can't really tell you how, but what we can say is we are constantly finding a hole in supercell (creators of the game) servers and exploit it ourself.</p>

        <p>We hope you will like it and any suggestions are welcome, keep in mind you can get unlimited amount of gems with our tool totally for free everyday until we make pay-wall for it or remove it from the web.</p>
