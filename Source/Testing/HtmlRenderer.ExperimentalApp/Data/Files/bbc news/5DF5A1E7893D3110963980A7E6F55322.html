<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

      <div class="description padded"><p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation</b> (<b>BBC</b>) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, and is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation and the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.</p>
<p>The BBC is established under a Royal Charter and operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households, companies, and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts. The fee is set by the British Government, agreed by Parliament, and used to fund the BBC's extensive radio, TV, and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK. Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic, and Persian.</p>
<p>Around a quarter of BBC revenues come from its commercial arm BBC Worldwide Ltd, which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC World News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd.</p></div>

The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.<\/p>\n<p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts. Facebook deems users from the ages of 13 to 18 as being a minor and therefore, sets their profiles to share its content with friends only.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":0,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1066\/","slug":"facebook","daily_count":0,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/RM","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/facebook\/","links":"","created_on":"2010-05-12T21:51:00","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/b\/bf\/Facebook_user_page_%282014%29.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":390,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1066","name":"Facebook","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Company","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1066","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:57:09.061922","local_url":"\/topic\/facebook\/","image_height":219,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook","latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T15:38:44.996829","geohash":""},{"item_count":4869,"kind":"tag","id":8719,"description":"<p>The <b>mass media<\/b> is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":37,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","slug":"tech","daily_count":3,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","name":"tech","latitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingbytes","trend_rank_last":37,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","image_height":612,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-12-20T20:38:47.418330","slug":"facebook-debuts-live-audio-streams-in-partnership","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1054987\/","type":"text","id":1054987,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Eab5","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/20\/facebook-debuts-live-audio-streams-in-partnership","date":"2016-12-20T20:38:45.680400","push_content":"Facebook debuts live audio streams in partnership with BBC - The Verge","data":null,"whoas":19,"date_ap":"Dec 20, 2016, 08:38 PM GMT","url_text":"Read more on theverge.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"Facebook debuts live audio streams in partnership with BBC - The Verge","url":"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/12\/20\/14030608\/facebook-live-audio-bbc","ping":null,"url_domain":"theverge.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Jimmy","last_name":"Lovaas","username":"jimmy.lovaas","email":"jimmy.lovaas@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/22\/","id":22,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Jimmy Lovaas"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2i79gUA","url_external_text":"Read more on theverge.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/12\/20\/facebook-debuts-live-audio-streams-in-partnership","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/12\/20\/14030608\/facebook-live-audio-bbc","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.

During his reign, he was served by a total of 30 prime ministers beginning with Pridi Banomyong and ending with Prayut Chan-o-cha.<\/p>\n<p>In 1957, a military coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of <i>lèse-majesté<\/i>, which is an offense against the dignity of the monarch, punishable under Thai law. This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military, leading the king to condone the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships. Although Bhumibol did invite public criticism in a 2005 speech, the <i>lèse majesté<\/i> laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament.<\/p>\n<p><i>Forbes<\/i> estimated Bhumibol's fortune—including property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), a unique body that is neither private nor government-owned—to be US$30 billion in 2010, and he was the head of the magazine's list of the \"world's richest royals\" from 2008 to 2013. In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was once again listed as US$30 billion. Officially the assets managed by the CPB are owned by the crown as an institution, not Bhumibol Adulyadej as an individual.<\/p>\n<p>After 2006, Bhumibol suffered declining health and spent extended periods at Siriraj Hospital, where he died on 13 October 2016. He was generally highly revered by the people in Thailand – many even saw him as close to divine. Notable political activists and Thai citizens who criticized the king or the institution of monarchy were often forced to exile the country or suffered frequent imprisonments.<\/p>\n<p>His successor Vajiralongkorn does not share the popularity of his father, leading to concerns that the Thai monarchy will lose prestige and influence under the latter's reign.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":0,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/360433\/","slug":"health-of-thailands-king-bhumibol-adulyadej","daily_count":0,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bfvb","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/health-of-thailands-king-bhumibol-adulyadej\/","links":"","created_on":"2016-10-12T12:48:18.641320","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/81\/King_Bhumibol_Adulyadej_2010-9-29.jpg\/512px-King_Bhumibol_Adulyadej_2010-9-29.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=360433","name":"Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej dies","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bhumibol_Adulyadej\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"PoliticsEvent","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=360433","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T18:01:12.362286","local_url":"\/topic\/health-of-thailands-king-bhumibol-adulyadej\/","image_height":627,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bhumibol_Adulyadej","latest_item_date":"2016-12-07T06:34:57.134619","geohash":""},{"item_count":1252,"kind":"location","id":2374,"description":"<p><b>Thailand<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/aɪ\/ long 'i' in 'tide'\">aɪ<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"\/æ\/ short 'a' in 'bad'\">æ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i><b><span><span>TY<\/span><\/span><\/b>-land<\/i><\/span> or <span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/aɪ\/ long 'i' in 'tide'\">aɪ<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i><b><span><span>TY<\/span><\/span><\/b>-lənd<\/i><\/span>; Thai: <span lang=\"th\">ประเทศไทย<\/span>, <span>rtgs<\/span>: <span title=\"Thai transliteration\"><i>Prathet Thai<\/i><\/span>, <small>pronounced<\/small> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[pra.tʰêːt tʰaj]<\/span>), officially the <b>Kingdom of Thailand<\/b> (Thai: <span lang=\"th\">ราชอาณาจักรไทย<\/span>, <span>rtgs<\/span>: <span title=\"Thai transliteration\"><i>Ratcha-anachak Thai<\/i><\/span>  <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[râːt.t͡ɕʰa.ʔaː.naː.t͡ɕàk tʰaj]<\/span>), formerly known as <b>Siam<\/b> (Thai: <span lang=\"th\">สยาม<\/span>, <span>rtgs<\/span>: <span title=\"Thai transliteration\"><i>Sayam<\/i><\/span>  <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[sa.jǎːm]<\/span>), is a country at the centre of the Indochinese peninsula in Southeast Asia.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":2,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","slug":"politics","daily_count":27,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","name":"politics","latitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","trend_rank_last":2,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":5,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","image_height":503,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-12-07T07:26:27.906610","slug":"minister-thailand-to-investigate-bbc-over-online","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1038664\/","type":"text","id":1038664,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EWMo","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/07\/minister-thailand-to-investigate-bbc-over-online","date":"2016-12-07T06:34:57.134619","push_content":"Minister: Thailand to investigate BBC over online profile of new king - The Guardian","data":null,"whoas":35,"date_ap":"Dec 07, 2016, 06:34 AM GMT","url_text":"Read more on theguardian.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"Minister: Thailand to investigate BBC over online profile of new king - The Guardian","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2016\/dec\/07\/thailand-investigation-bbc-alleged-insult-new-king","ping":null,"url_domain":"theguardian.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","id":7,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tom Brew"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2h4jx0d","url_external_text":"Read more on theguardian.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/12\/07\/minister-thailand-to-investigate-bbc-over-online","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2016\/dec\/07\/thailand-investigation-bbc-alleged-insult-new-king","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":45,"kind":"arc","id":6335,"description":"<p>Sir Jimmy Savile (1926–2011) was an English DJ, television and radio personality, who was well known in Britain for his eccentricities and, at the time of his death, was generally respected for his charitable work. He was knighted in 1990. In September and October 2012, almost a year after his death, claims were widely publicised that he had committed sexual abuse, his alleged victims ranging from prepubescent girls and boys to adults. By 11 October 2012 allegations had been made to 13 British police forces, and this led to the setting-up of inquiries into practices at the BBC and within the National Health Service.<\/p>\n<p>On 19 October 2012 the Metropolitan Police Service launched a formal criminal investigation, Operation Yewtree, into historic allegations of child sexual abuse by Savile and other people, some still living, over four decades. It stated that it was pursuing over 400 lines of inquiry, based on the claims of 200 witnesses, via 14 police forces across the UK. It described the alleged abuse as being \"on an unprecedented scale\", and the number of potential victims as \"staggering\". By 19 December, eight people had been questioned as part of the investigation. The Metropolitan Police stated that the total number of alleged victims was 589, of whom 450 alleged abuse by Savile.<\/p>\n<p>The report of the investigations undertaken jointly by the police and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), <i>Giving Victims a Voice<\/i>, was published on 11 January 2013. It reported allegations covering a period of fifty years, including 214 alleged acts by Savile which, though uncorroborated, have been formally recorded as crimes, some involving children as young as eight. The report states \"within the recorded crimes there are 126 indecent acts and 34 rape\/penetration offences.\" Alleged offences took place at 13 hospitals as well as on BBC premises, according to the report. In October 2013 it was announced that inquiries had been extended to other hospitals. On 26 June 2014, the Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, reported on the findings of the investigations led by Kate Lampard. He said that Savile had sexually assaulted victims aged between five and 75 in NHS hospitals, and apologised to the victims. Further investigations, in hospitals and elsewhere, led to additional allegations of sexual abuse by Savile.<\/p>\n<p>Much of Savile's career involved working with children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting <i>Top of the Pops<\/i> before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting <i>Jim'll Fix It<\/i>, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought related to sexual offences. In October 2012 it was announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.<\/p>\n<p>The scandal was a major factor leading to the establishment of the wider-ranging Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse which was announced by the Home Secretary, Theresa May, in July 2014. In February 2015 the inquiry was reconfigured as a statutory inquiry to be chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":0,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/6335\/","slug":"inquiry-into-bbcs-shelved-jimmy-savile-report","daily_count":0,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BoL","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/inquiry-into-bbcs-shelved-jimmy-savile-report\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-19T16:36:41","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/5\/51\/Jimmy_Savile%2C_Headstone.jpg\/512px-Jimmy_Savile%2C_Headstone.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=6335","name":"BBC resignations over Jimmy Savile reporting","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"off","recent_count":0,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=6335","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:09:11.809145","local_url":"\/topic\/inquiry-into-bbcs-shelved-jimmy-savile-report\/","image_height":320,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jimmy_Savile_sexual_abuse_scandal","latest_item_date":"2016-10-19T10:22:49.903858","geohash":""},{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-10-19T10:22:51.108305","slug":"british-broadcaster-tony-blackburn-to-return-to","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/980202\/","type":"text","id":980202,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EG9s","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/19\/british-broadcaster-tony-blackburn-to-return-to","date":"2016-10-19T10:22:49.903858","push_content":"British broadcaster Tony Blackburn to return to the BBC 8 months after leaving the corporation - BBC News","data":null,"whoas":30,"date_ap":"Oct 19, 2016, 10:22 AM GMT","url_text":"Read more on bbc.co.uk","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"British broadcaster Tony Blackburn to return to the BBC 8 months after leaving the corporation - BBC News","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-37703509","ping":null,"url_domain":"bbc.co.uk","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"Banks","username":"grace.banks","email":"grace.banks@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/36\/","id":36,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Grace Banks"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EG9s","url_external_text":"Read more on bbc.co.uk","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/19\/british-broadcaster-tony-blackburn-to-return-to","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-37703509","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":55977,"kind":"vertical","id":7,"description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-10-13T12:33:54.248020","slug":"bbc-to-cut-300-jobs-in-its-production-department","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/975102\/","type":"text","id":975102,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EFpc","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/13\/bbc-to-cut-300-jobs-in-its-production-department","date":"2016-10-13T09:35:13.838793","push_content":"BBC to cut 300 jobs in its production department in company-wide restructuring, director Mark Linsey said - City A.M.","data":null,"whoas":20,"date_ap":"Oct 13, 2016, 09:35 AM GMT","url_text":"Read more on cityam.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"BBC to cut 300 jobs in its production department in company-wide restructuring, director Mark Linsey said - City A.M.","url":"http:\/\/www.cityam.com\/251362\/bbc-cut-300-jobs-its-production-arm-","ping":null,"url_domain":"cityam.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"Banks","username":"grace.banks","email":"grace.banks@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/36\/","id":36,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Grace Banks"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ejss05","url_external_text":"Read more on cityam.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/13\/bbc-to-cut-300-jobs-in-its-production-department","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.cityam.com\/251362\/bbc-cut-300-jobs-its-production-arm-","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":336,"kind":"arc","id":342498,"description":"<p><b>Operation Yewtree<\/b> is a police investigation into sexual abuse allegations, predominantly the abuse of children, against the British media personality Jimmy Savile and others.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":5,"kind":"tag","id":356536,"description":"<p><i><b>The Great British Bake Off<\/b><\/i>, often referred to as <i><b>Bake Off<\/b><\/i> or <i><b>GBBO<\/b><\/i>, is a British television baking competition which selects from amongst its contestants the best amateur baker.

It has aired under the name <i><b>The Great British Baking Show<\/b><\/i> in the United States due to Pillsbury owning the Bake-Off trademark in the US.<\/p>\n<p>It was first shown on BBC Two in August 2010, and after becoming the most popular programme on that channel was moved to BBC One for its fifth series. The show has become a significant part of British culture and is credited with reinvigorating interest in baking throughout the United Kingdom. Many of its participants, including winners, have gone on to start a career based on bakery. The winners are Edd Kimber, Joanne Wheatley, John Whaite, Frances Quinn, Nancy Birtwhistle, Nadiya Hussain and most recently Candice Brown.<\/p>\n<p>The BAFTA award-winning programme has spawned a number of specials and spin-off shows – a celebrity charity series in aid of Sport Relief or Comic Relief, <i>Junior Bake Off<\/i> for young children (broadcast on the CBBC channel), companion series <i>An Extra Slice<\/i>, and <i>Bake Off: Crème de la Crème<\/i> for teams of professional pastry chefs (both on BBC Two).

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":55977,"kind":"vertical","id":7,"description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":1,"updated_date":"2016-09-13T15:48:42.749062","slug":"uk-comedy-duo-sue-perkins-mel-giedroyc-say-they","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/948320\/","type":"text","id":948320,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D8re","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/13\/uk-comedy-duo-sue-perkins-mel-giedroyc-say-they","date":"2016-09-13T15:48:42.490573","push_content":"UK comedy duo Sue Perkins, Mel Giedroyc say they were 'shocked and saddened' to learn 'The Great British Bake Off' would be leaving BBC, had campaigned for it to stay at broadcaster - BBC news","data":null,"whoas":24,"date_ap":"Sep 13, 2016, 03:48 PM GMT","url_text":"Read more on www.bbc.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"UK comedy duo Sue Perkins, Mel Giedroyc say they were 'shocked and saddened' to learn 'The Great British Bake Off' would be leaving BBC, had campaigned for it to stay at broadcaster - BBC news","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/entertainment-arts-37355065","ping":null,"url_domain":"www.bbc.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","last_name":"McDermott","username":"tricia.mcdermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","id":23,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/2ctxSTP","url_external_text":"Read more on www.bbc.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/13\/uk-comedy-duo-sue-perkins-mel-giedroyc-say-they","pushed":false,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/entertainment-arts-37355065","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":3456,"primary":true,"kind":"tag","id":109,"description":"<p><b>Television<\/b> or <b>TV<\/b> is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-09-12T19:02:47.604637","slug":"producers-confirm-uks-the-great-british-bake","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/947636\/","type":"text","id":947636,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D8gc","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/12\/producers-confirm-uks-the-great-british-bake","date":"2016-09-12T19:02:46.640385","push_content":"Producers confirm UK's 'The Great British Bake Off' signs new 3-year deal with Channel 4 after leaving BBC - PA","data":null,"whoas":34,"date_ap":"Sep 12, 2016, 07:02 PM GMT","url_text":"End of alert","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"Producers confirm UK's 'The Great British Bake Off' signs new 3-year deal with Channel 4 after leaving BBC - PA","url":"","ping":null,"url_domain":"breakingnews.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","last_name":"McDermott","username":"tricia.mcdermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","id":23,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D8gc","url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/12\/producers-confirm-uks-the-great-british-bake","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/12\/producers-confirm-uks-the-great-british-bake","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":3456,"primary":true,"kind":"tag","id":109,"description":"<p><b>Television<\/b> or <b>TV<\/b> is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound.

A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

The winners are Edd Kimber, Joanne Wheatley, John Whaite, Frances Quinn, Nancy Birtwhistle, Nadiya Hussain and most recently Candice Brown.<\/p>\n<p>The BAFTA award-winning programme has spawned a number of specials and spin-off shows – a celebrity charity series in aid of Sport Relief or Comic Relief, <i>Junior Bake Off<\/i> for young children (broadcast on the CBBC channel), companion series <i>An Extra Slice<\/i>, and <i>Bake Off: Crème de la Crème<\/i> for teams of professional pastry chefs (both on BBC Two).

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCBreaking\/status\/775381846179872768","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/460740982498013184\/wIPwMwru_normal.png","user_id":"5402612","name":"BBC Breaking News","date":"2016-09-12T17:13:32","screen_name":"BBCBreaking","id":665427,"content":"Current series of Great British Bake Off will be the last seen on the BBC, Love Productions tells the corporation https:\/\/t.co\/rlPqfdeNoz","tweet_id":"775381846179872768","location":"London, England"},"importance":2,"updated_date":"2016-09-12T17:51:56.625268","slug":"current-series-of-great-british-bake-off-will-be","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/947547\/","type":"text","id":947547,"source":"breaking-news-accounts","note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D8fB","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/12\/current-series-of-great-british-bake-off-will-be","date":"2016-09-12T17:15:10.299656","push_content":"BBC loses bid to air next season of 'The Great British Bake Off' after contract negotiations fail over money, branding - BBC News","data":null,"whoas":15,"date_ap":"Sep 12, 2016, 05:15 PM GMT","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"BBC loses bid to air next season of 'The Great British Bake Off' after contract negotiations fail over money, branding - BBC News","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-37344292?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central","ping":null,"url_domain":"bbc.co.uk","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","last_name":"McDermott","username":"tricia.mcdermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","id":23,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/2cqDSws","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","submitter":"feed","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/12\/current-series-of-great-british-bake-off-will-be","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-37344292?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded – probably close to an already existing Celtic Briton village or settlement – around the year 43 by the Romans, who named it <i>Londinium<\/i>. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km<sup>2<\/sup>) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.<\/p>\n<p>As a Nylonkong metropolis, London is a leading global city, in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transport. It is one of the world's leading financial centres and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world. London is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, and a 2014 report placed it first in the world university rankings. According to the report London also ranks first in the world in software, multimedia development and design, and shares first position in technology readiness. In 2012, London became the only city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.<\/p>\n<p>London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Its estimated mid-2015 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,673,713, the largest of any city in the European Union, and accounting for 12.5 per cent of the UK population. London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The city's metropolitan area is one of the most populous in Europe with 13,879,757 inhabitants, while the Greater London Authority states the population of the <i>city-region<\/i> (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million. London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.<\/p>\n<p>London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT). Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres. The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":75,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/165\/","slug":"london-england-gb","daily_count":0,"longitude":-0.12721,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cp","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T19:13:37","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/cd\/London_Montage_L.jpg\/512px-London_Montage_L.jpg","woeid":44418,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=165","name":"London, England, United Kingdom","latitude":51.506401,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":75,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Town","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=165","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T02:53:45.095947","local_url":"\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","image_height":772,"placetype":"Town","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London","latest_item_date":"2016-12-28T01:03:31.136558","geohash":"gcpvj07mvqjx"},{"item_count":59,"kind":"location","id":9719,"description":"<p><b>Central London<\/b> is the innermost part of London, England.

At a certain point in the combustion reaction, called the ignition point, flames are produced. The <i>flame<\/i> is the visible portion of the fire. Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.<\/p>\n<p>Fire in its most common form can result in conflagration, which has the potential to cause physical damage through burning. Fire is an important process that affects ecological systems around the globe. The positive effects of fire include stimulating growth and maintaining various ecological systems.<\/p>\n<p>The negative effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination. If fire removes protective vegetation, heavy rainfall may lead to an increase in soil erosion by water. Also, when vegetation is burned, the nitrogen it contains is released into the atmosphere, unlike elements such as potassium and phosphorus which remain in the ash and are quickly recycled into the soil. This loss of nitrogen caused by a fire produces a long-term reduction in the fertility of the soil, which only slowly recovers as nitrogen is \"fixed\" from the atmosphere by lightning and by leguminous plants such as clover.<\/p>\n<p>Fire has been used by humans in rituals, in agriculture for clearing land, for cooking, generating heat and light, for signaling, propulsion purposes, smelting, forging, incineration of waste, cremation, and as a weapon or mode of destruction.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":19,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/273\/","slug":"fires","daily_count":5,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EZ","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/fires\/","links":"","created_on":"2010-05-07T04:22:52","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/36\/Large_bonfire.jpg\/512px-Large_bonfire.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[{"symbol":"🔥","id":5,"description":"When you see a lot of smoke or a large fire response","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/ping_categories\/5\/","slug":"fire","name":"Fire","aliases":["ablaze","alight","arson","burn","fiery","flame","smoke"]}],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=273","name":"fires","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":19,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":1,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=273","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:57:49.557998","local_url":"\/topic\/fires\/","image_height":341,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:27:58.836898","geohash":""},{"item_count":36,"kind":"tag","id":9723,"description":"<p>The <b>London Fire Brigade<\/b> (<b>LFB<\/b>) is the statutory fire and rescue service for London.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded – probably close to an already existing Celtic Briton village or settlement – around the year 43 by the Romans, who named it <i>Londinium<\/i>. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km<sup>2<\/sup>) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.<\/p>\n<p>As a Nylonkong metropolis, London is a leading global city, in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transport. It is one of the world's leading financial centres and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world. London is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, and a 2014 report placed it first in the world university rankings. According to the report London also ranks first in the world in software, multimedia development and design, and shares first position in technology readiness. In 2012, London became the only city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.<\/p>\n<p>London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Its estimated mid-2015 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,673,713, the largest of any city in the European Union, and accounting for 12.5 per cent of the UK population. London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The city's metropolitan area is one of the most populous in Europe with 13,879,757 inhabitants, while the Greater London Authority states the population of the <i>city-region<\/i> (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million. London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.<\/p>\n<p>London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT). Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres. The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":75,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/165\/","slug":"london-england-gb","daily_count":0,"longitude":-0.12721,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cp","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T19:13:37","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/cd\/London_Montage_L.jpg\/512px-London_Montage_L.jpg","woeid":44418,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=165","name":"London, England, United Kingdom","latitude":51.506401,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":75,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Town","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=165","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T02:53:45.095947","local_url":"\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","image_height":772,"placetype":"Town","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/London","latest_item_date":"2016-12-28T01:03:31.136558","geohash":"gcpvj07mvqjx"},{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\").

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mediaguardian\/status\/756125197489537025","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/564819348464734208\/CCyW_Gm5_normal.png","user_id":"16672510","name":"Media Guardian","date":"2016-07-21T13:54:29","screen_name":"mediaguardian","id":635308,"content":"BBC to make Les Misérables for TV with War and Peace team https:\/\/t.co\/192utCiSRI https:\/\/t.co\/VOTke1uOtl","tweet_id":"756125197489537025","location":"UK"},"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-07-21T13:58:52.793851","slug":"bbc-to-produce-les-miserables-as-6-part-tv-special","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/902984\/","type":"text","id":902984,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dw4Q","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/21\/bbc-to-produce-les-miserables-as-6-part-tv-special","date":"2016-07-21T13:58:52.339102","push_content":"BBC to produce Les Misérables as 6-part TV special - The Guardian","data":null,"whoas":33,"date_ap":"Jul 21, 2016, 01:58 PM GMT","url_text":"Read more on theguardian.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"BBC to produce Les Misérables as 6-part TV special - The Guardian","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2016\/jul\/21\/bbc-les-miserables-tv-war-peace-harvey-weinstein-andrew-davies","ping":null,"url_domain":"theguardian.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","last_name":"McDermott","username":"tricia.mcdermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","id":23,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ajdsh4","url_external_text":"Read more on theguardian.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/07\/21\/bbc-to-produce-les-miserables-as-6-part-tv-special","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2016\/jul\/21\/bbc-les-miserables-tv-war-peace-harvey-weinstein-andrew-davies","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently. <b>Outdoor media<\/b> transmit information via such media as AR advertising; billboards; blimps; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); placards or kiosks placed inside and outside of buses, commercial buildings, shops, sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or skywriting. <b>Print media<\/b> transmit information via physical objects, such as books, comics, magazines, newspapers, or pamphlets. <b>Event organizing<\/b> and <b>public speaking<\/b> can also be considered forms of mass media.<\/p>\n<p>The organizations that control these technologies, such as movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations, are also known as the mass media.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":81,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/8719\/","slug":"media","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CQn","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/media\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-05-01T16:06:44","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/77\/Crystal_radio_advertisement.png\/512px-Crystal_radio_advertisement.png","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=8719","name":"media","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":81,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_media\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:58:53.062721","local_url":"\/topic\/media\/","image_height":309,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_media","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","geohash":""},{"item_count":55977,"kind":"vertical","id":7,"description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":37,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","slug":"tech","daily_count":3,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","name":"tech","latitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingbytes","trend_rank_last":37,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","image_height":612,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":2,"updated_date":"2016-07-19T12:57:29.991652","slug":"british-broadcaster-bbc-launch-app-that-acts-as","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/900187\/","type":"text","id":900187,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DwLJ","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/19\/british-broadcaster-bbc-launch-app-that-acts-as","date":"2016-07-19T12:42:29.243498","push_content":"British Broadcaster BBC launch app that acts as personalized hub for BBC content, app launched by BBC Worldwide - BBC","data":null,"whoas":19,"date_ap":"Jul 19, 2016, 12:42 PM GMT","url_text":"End of alert","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"British Broadcaster BBC launch app that acts as personalized hub for BBC content - BBC","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-36834757","ping":null,"url_domain":"www.bbc.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"Banks","username":"grace.banks","email":"grace.banks@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/36\/","id":36,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Grace Banks"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/2ada9bc","url_external_text":"End of alert","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/07\/19\/british-broadcaster-bbc-launch-app-that-acts-as","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-36834757","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":13941,"kind":"vertical","id":75,"description":"<p><b>Entertainment<\/b> is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BBCBreaking\/status\/753168187039031296","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/460740982498013184\/wIPwMwru_normal.png","user_id":"5402612","name":"BBC Breaking News","date":"2016-07-13T10:04:23","screen_name":"BBCBreaking","id":627773,"content":"Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman to leave show after next series, BBC says https:\/\/t.co\/43uu9Z12jO","tweet_id":"753168187039031296","location":"London, England"},"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-07-13T11:20:01.868658","slug":"strictly-come-dancing-head-judge-len-goodman-to","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/892437\/","type":"text","id":892437,"source":"breaking-news-accounts","note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DuKJ","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/13\/strictly-come-dancing-head-judge-len-goodman-to","date":"2016-07-13T10:06:39.028823","push_content":"'Strictly Come Dancing' head judge Len Goodman to leave show after next series, BBC says - BBC News","data":null,"whoas":13,"date_ap":"Jul 13, 2016, 10:06 AM GMT","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"'Strictly Come Dancing' head judge Len Goodman to leave show after next series, BBC says - BBC News","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-36783983?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central","ping":null,"url_domain":"bbc.co.uk","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"Bratek","username":"rebecca.bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","id":29,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/29WU8pp","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","submitter":"feed","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/07\/13\/strictly-come-dancing-head-judge-len-goodman-to","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/entertainment-arts-36783983?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central","sponsor":null},{"topics":[{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

Richard has sold more than 250 million records worldwide. He has total sales of over 21 million singles in the United Kingdom and is the third-top-selling artist in UK Singles Chart history, behind the Beatles and Elvis Presley.<\/p>\n<p>Richard was originally positioned as a rebellious rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard and Elvis Presley. With his backing group, the Shadows, Richard dominated the British popular music scene in the pre-Beatles period of the late 1950s to early 1960s. His 1958 hit single, \"Move It\", is often described as Britain's first authentic rock and roll song, and John Lennon once claimed that \"before Cliff and the Shadows, there had been nothing worth listening to in British music.\" Increased focus on his Christian faith and subsequent softening of his music later led to a more middle of the road pop image, and he sometimes ventured into contemporary Christian music.<\/p>\n<p>Over a career spanning more than 50 years Richard has amassed many gold and platinum discs and awards, including three Brit Awards—winning Best British Male twice and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and two Ivor Novello Awards. He has had more than 130 singles, albums and EPs make the UK Top 20, more than any other artist. Richard has had 67 UK top ten singles, the second highest total for an artist behind Elvis Presley. Richard holds the record (with Elvis Presley) as the only act to make the UK singles charts in all of its first six decades (1950s–2000s). He has achieved 14 UK No. 1 singles, and is the only singer to have had a No. 1 single in the UK in five consecutive decades: the 1950s through to the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>Richard has never achieved the same impact in the United States despite eight US Top 40 singles, including the million-selling \"Devil Woman\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore\". In Canada, Richard achieved comparatively more success, with a successful period in the early 1960s, and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s with some singles and albums reaching gold and platinum status. He has remained a popular music, film, and television personality in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Northern Europe and Asia, and he retains a following in other countries.<\/p>\n<p>Richard has been a resident in the United Kingdom for most of his life, but in 2010, he confirmed that he had become a citizen of Barbados. He divides his time between living in Barbados and Portugal.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":0,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/76344\/","slug":"cliff-richard","daily_count":0,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/T1W","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cliff-richard\/","links":"","created_on":"2014-08-14T12:03:20.726289","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c3\/Cliff_Richard_Brussels.jpg\/512px-Cliff_Richard_Brussels.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=76344","name":"Cliff Richard","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cliff_Richard\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Person","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=76344","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:47:47.378058","local_url":"\/topic\/cliff-richard\/","image_height":683,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cliff_Richard","latest_item_date":"2016-09-27T10:41:01.726666","geohash":""},{"item_count":104890,"kind":"vertical","id":1,"description":"<p>In ordinary language, a <b>crime<\/b> is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":82,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/109\/","slug":"television","daily_count":2,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bv","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-12-04T04:22:01","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","name":"television","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":82,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Subvertical","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:05:37.806048","local_url":"\/topic\/television\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","geohash":""},{"item_count":950,"kind":"location","id":232,"description":"<p><b>Scotland<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'s' in 'sigh'\">s<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/.\/ syllable break\">.<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Scots: <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈskɔt.lənd]<\/span>; Scottish Gaelic: <span lang=\"gd\"><i>Alba<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈal̪ˠapə]<\/span>) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.<\/p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland, thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms. Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain. (The Treaty of Union was agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin Acts of Union 1707, passed by the Parliaments of both kingdoms, despite popular opposition and anti-union riots in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and elsewhere). The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain, which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England and later became the Parliament of the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>Within Scotland, the monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The legal system within Scotland has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law. The continued existence of legal, educational, religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with England.<\/p>\n<p>Edinburgh, the country's capital and second-largest city, was the hub of the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century, which transformed Scotland into one of the commercial, intellectual, and industrial powerhouses of Europe. Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, was once one of the world's leading industrial cities and now lies at the centre of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Other major urban areas are Aberdeen and Dundee. Scottish waters consist of a large sector of the North Atlantic and the North Sea, containing the largest oil reserves in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>Following a referendum in 1997, a Scottish Parliament was re-established, in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members, having authority over many areas of domestic policy. The Scottish National Party, (SNP), which supports Scottish independence, won an overall majority in the 2011 Scottish Parliament general election and legislated for an independence referendum which was held on 18 September 2014; a majority of 55% to 45% rejected independence on an 85% voter turnout. The UK Conservative Party won an overall majority in the 2015 UK general election and legislated for a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union which was held on 23 June 2016; within Scotland, a majority of 62% to 38% rejected withdrawal from the EU on a 67% voter turnout. Scotland is represented in the UK Parliament by 59 MPs and in the European Parliament by 6 MEPs. Scotland is also a member nation of the British–Irish Council, and the British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":0,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/232\/","slug":"scotland-gb","daily_count":0,"longitude":-3.99667,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Du","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/scotland-gb\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:41","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/1\/10\/Flag_of_Scotland.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png","woeid":12578048,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=232","name":"Scotland, United Kingdom","latitude":56.652859,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scotland\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=232","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:49:38.067415","local_url":"\/topic\/scotland-gb\/","image_height":307,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scotland","latest_item_date":"2016-12-24T18:43:22.329140","geohash":"gfj4m13enf4b"},{"item_count":12097,"kind":"location","id":30,"description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":86,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","daily_count":1,"longitude":-2.23001,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","links":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","woeid":23424975,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","name":"United Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":86,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Country","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","image_height":256,"placetype":"Country","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404"},{"item_count":356,"kind":"tag","id":641,"description":"<p>The <b>British Broadcasting Corporation<\/b> (<b>BBC<\/b>) is a British public service broadcaster.

Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic, and Persian.<\/p>\n<p>Around a quarter of BBC revenues come from its commercial arm BBC Worldwide Ltd, which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC World News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":0,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/641\/","slug":"bbc","daily_count":0,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/KV","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/bbc\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-03-04T02:16:09","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/8c\/BBC_TV_Centre.jpg\/512px-BBC_TV_Centre.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=641","name":"BBC","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BBC\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":0,"category":"Company","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=641","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:28:57.248583","local_url":"\/topic\/bbc\/","image_height":384,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BBC","latest_item_date":"2016-12-20T20:38:45.680400","geohash":""},{"item_count":4,"kind":"tag","id":82660,"description":"<p><b>BBC Scotland<\/b> (Scottish Gaelic: <span lang=\"gd\"><i>BBC Alba<\/i><\/span>) is the division of the BBC, and the publicly funded broadcaster for Scotland.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","livevideo":"","trend_rank_current":83,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","daily_count":8,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","links":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","visible":true,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"image_width":512,"ping_category":[],"muted_by_default":false,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","name":"entertainment","latitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","facebookchat":"","recent_count":2,"category":"Topic","active":true,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","image_height":592,"placetype":"","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","geohash":""}],"tweet":null,"importance":3,"updated_date":"2016-06-21T17:24:40.703334","slug":"bbc-pulls-plug-on-flagship-current-affairs-show","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/867616\/","type":"text","id":867616,"source":null,"note":null,"media":null,"longitude":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dnry","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/06\/21\/bbc-pulls-plug-on-flagship-current-affairs-show","date":"2016-06-21T17:24:35.588341","push_content":"BBC pulls plug on flagship current affairs show 'Scotland 2016' as part of news overhaul - Guardian","data":null,"whoas":23,"date_ap":"Jun 21, 2016, 05:24 PM GMT","url_text":"Read more on theguardian.com","status":"published","latitude":null,"content":"BBC pulls plug on flagship current affairs show 'Scotland 2016' as part of news overhaul - Guardian","url":"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2016\/jun\/21\/bbc-to-scrap-flagship-current-affairs-show-scotland-2016","ping":null,"url_domain":"theguardian.com","data_type":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","last_name":"McDermott","username":"tricia.mcdermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","id":23,"is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott"},"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/28Mep0s","url_external_text":"Read more on theguardian.com","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/06\/21\/bbc-pulls-plug-on-flagship-current-affairs-show","pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2016\/jun\/21\/bbc-to-scrap-flagship-current-affairs-show-scotland-2016","sponsor":null}],"meta":{"next":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=641&type__in=text%2Ctweet%2Cnote%2Cupcoming%2Cdata&date__lt=2016-06-21+17%3A24%3A35.588341%2B00%3A00&status__in=published%2Cwhitelisted","limit":20}}
