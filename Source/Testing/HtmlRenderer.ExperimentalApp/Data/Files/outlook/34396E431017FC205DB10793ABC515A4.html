Missing that one important email because your inbox is cluttered with garbage. \nBut it doesn't have to be that way. \nSEE ALSO: The best thing you can do to protect yourself from hackers\nThankfully, there are numerous tricks you can use to make sure that you see the emails you want to see, when you want to see them. While the specifics of your digital streamlining will vary depending on your email provider of choice, that's OK! We're here to break it all down for you, nice and easy like. \nGmail\nGoogle's Gmail offers up numerous options to flag important incoming emails, and even employs one of them by default. The default flag is called an \"importance marker,\" and it's slapped on an email after Google's fancy algorithms have used a variety of factors to determine that it's worth giving a damn about. \nThose factors include, but are not limited to, practical considerations like \"who you email, and how often you email them,\" \"which emails you open,\" and \"which emails you reply to.\"\nIf Google does decide an email is worthy of an importance marker, you'll see what looks like a little rightward-facing arrow in your inbox pointing to the message in question. If you only want to see emails marked in this way, search \"is:important\" in your inbox search bar. \nBut what if this default option isn't a good fit? What if Gmail's importance markers miss your actually important stuff and only serve to confuse you? \nThat's totally cool, because there are more tools in the Gmail toolshed.\n\nYour first step after deciding to ditch importance markers should be to disable the feature. You can do this by logging into your account (via browser) and clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right corner. Next, select \"settings\" and then click \"inbox.\" Scroll down to \"importance markers\" and select \"no markers.\" \nThat's it. You're free of Google deciding what emails you should read, and, conversely, what you should ignore. \nThe magic of filters\nThat means it's time to set up your own filters. The obvious one it to mark specific people as being really important: Your boss, your partner, your best friend, or your lawyer are people whose emails you wouldn't want to miss. \nThe steps to mark specific senders as important are relatively straightforward. First, type the person's email address in your browser search bar. After you search for them, select the \"more\" drop-down menu then choose \"create filter.\" The next part looks tricky, but if you've made it this far into this story you can definitely manage. Make sure the important email address is in the \"from\" field, and then select \"create filter with this search.\" \nThe next screen gives you the option to have Gmail star future message from that sender, mark them as important, or to make sure those messages stay out of the spam folder. For truly important people, we recommend you check all three.\n\nDon't forget to hit \"create filter,\" and you're done. \nEasy, right? Now you'll never miss another vital email in your Gmail account (jk — you totally still will every now and then, but that's because you're a human being).\nOutlook Mail\nMicrosoft makes it easy to designate emails as deserving of special attention, and goes one step further by allowing you to automatically pin messages to the top of your inbox. \nThat's right, whenever that email from your mom comes in it will stay front and center. \nTo turn on auto-pin, search for an email from said mom (she's bound to have sent you at least one) and, once you have it open, click on the \"more commands\" ellipsis in the toolbar. Next, choose \"create rule\" and make sure the condition for \"it was received from\" is both selected and has your mom's name in it. Then, remove any conditions that don't apply and then click the \"move the message to folder\" drop-down menu. After selecting \"pin the message,\" don't forget to hit \"OK\" in the upper-left hand corner. \nYou have now mastered the Outlook Mail pin.\nTo designate a specific sender as important you can follow the same pinning steps up until the last part, and instead of selecting \"pin the message\" just choose the \"mark the message\" \"with importance\" option. \nBoom. Easy. Kinda.\nYahoo! Mail\nThe first, and perhaps most important step you should take when using Yahoo! Mail is to stop using Yahoo! Mail (we only sort of kid). If you like the interface for whatever reason, or just don't want to give up that totally sick \"yournamecool@yahoo.com\" handle then there are some measures you can take to prioritize messages from the all stars in your life. \n\nStart things off by creating a new folder in your inbox and titling it something like \"Boss Baby.\" Next, make sure emails from any important people are automatically sent to that folder. \nIt's simple enough to do: Open an email from one of your very Boss Baby-like friends or colleagues and select the \"more\" drop-down menu. \nNow, click on \"filter emails like this.\" The \"from\" field should include the address of your special person (you can add more than one address in the field), and, when you've added all the appropriate email addresses, choose your folder labeled \"Boss Baby\" from the \"then move the message to this folder\" drop-down tab. Lastly, click \"save\" and you're good to go!\nYou still have a Yahoo! Mail account, but at least it's modestly organized now. \nThe ugly truth\nThe reality of email these days is that even with the above steps, stuff you actually give a hoot about is still going to get lost in the mix. With that in mind, the best approach is might actually be to have multiple email accounts (I have five that I use regularly, and several other throwaways). \nIt sounds like a pain, but it's not really. Almost everyone reading this likely has at least two different email accounts (work and personal) already. Try breaking out your personal accounts into themed groups. One account could be tied to all your social media accounts, a second tied to your friends, family, and banking, and yet another for any service or list that you need to sign up for. Then, within each account, go ahead and follow the steps outlined earlier in this piece. \nThis approach will take you a while to set up, but it is oh so sweet when you have it dialed in. And when you finally do, you can rest easy knowing that no notification from Facebook will ever again drown out that email from Grandma.\nWATCH: Man convinces email scammer he's flown to Hong Kong for Kit Kats and $13.9 million"},"shares":{"facebook":440,"pinterest":13,"linked_in":124,"google_plus":58,"twitter":821,"total":1456},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/R3iITHedddANphM6xwXceqVi1hY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F464776%2F4339f6f1-347c-46f9-a0c5-0791c08bd67c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xnYBskYx1HlNn1dJWoemiXUifZ0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/29rlTLM04Obf1C7lhU9-bFuibB4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/T-bZXW-kN8_6PHhHzHDy3NBV8vI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aRYYXZBgXOKv2UlFbrGfK7PQCvk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oUf7-evI690nYxam40gv_v2y10Y=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pUia99","display_title":"How to fix your chaotic nightmare of an email inbox","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"kqNR7cSt","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Email is messy, but it doesn't have to be.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How to fix your chaotic nightmare of an email inbox"},{"_id":"57d8aeaa6df612242500055b","id":"2016/09/13/microsoft-outlook-sunrise-update","title":"Microsoft updates Outlook's calendar as it says goodbye to Sunrise for good","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2016-09-14T01:57:13+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 01:57:13 +0000","formatted_date":"09/14/2016","formatted_shares":"908","sort_key":"1BJZJn","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/13/microsoft-outlook-sunrise-update/","content":{"plain":"Sunrise, the popular calendar app acquired by Microsoft in 2015, is officially no more.\nThe app's calendars have stopped updating and users will no longer be able to access their accounts through the app or website as of Sept. 14, the company revealed. In what may be an effort to help soften that blow, Microsoft also delivered a major update to the calendar features in its Outlook app Tuesday.\nSEE ALSO: 26 must-have apps for college life\nFor one, Outlook's calendar, which Microsoft had earlier confirmed would replace Sunrise, now has a design that looks much more like the old Sunrise app than previous versions. The in-app calendar uses colored icons that will look familiar to Sunrise users. The update also added a few new ones with event-specific graphics.\nOutlook is also much better at handling specific locations for events. It now uses Bing to fill in locations for meetings and appointments and you can open maps and directions directly from calendar entires as well.\n\nMicrosoft also updated the app with Skype for Business support and redesigned the view for the date and time picker, which lets you find open times in your calendar form within email messages. \nThough the improvements will likely come as welcome news to many Outlook users, dedicated Sunrise users may not be thrilled  with losing the well-regarded standalone calendar. In a final message on its blog Tuesday, the Sunrise team called Tuesday's update \"the end of an era,\" though they noted many of Sunrise's features now live on in Outlook.\nMicrosoft is also taking suggestions for new features that users want in Outlook's calendar with a new \"Suggest a Feature\" menu in the app's main settings. "},"shares":{"linked_in":35,"facebook":166,"twitter":685,"google_plus":17,"pinterest":5,"total":908},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/f1bN6mLyJzBqw7nwXxi3i-4Sp1k=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F209386%2F2015_2F10_2F28_2F6c_2Fsunrisecale.bb7b2.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O34B9TBQKVzwADuoZ4qrMyGdQEM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F20730%2F2015_2F10_2F28_2F6c_2Fsunrisecale.bb7b2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sTqfzJzmFJdT8n5oA5jOnR6CSK8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F20730%2F2015_2F10_2F28_2F6c_2Fsunrisecale.bb7b2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PXxwZ0tGCyegxHPdsSbDRjqUZ6s=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F20730%2F2015_2F10_2F28_2F6c_2Fsunrisecale.bb7b2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Qui-PdlnICpOzGfLcfNyU-kF1kI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F20730%2F2015_2F10_2F28_2F6c_2Fsunrisecale.bb7b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5aNDHmkaGnpU4v168iEvcJrf2VI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F20730%2F2015_2F10_2F28_2F6c_2Fsunrisecale.bb7b2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2cv8lq7","display_title":"Microsoft updates Outlook's calendar as it says goodbye to Sunrise for good","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Sunrise, the beloved calendar app, is no more.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Microsoft updates Outlook's calendar as it says goodbye to Sunrise for good"},{"_id":"56e6e2f6b589e43727000e84","id":"2016/03/14/outlook-email-ios-touch-id","title":"Outlook for iOS can now protect your emails with your fingerprint","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2016-03-14T16:12:23+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 16:12:23 +0000","formatted_date":"03/14/2016","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1AFAPk","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/03/14/outlook-email-ios-touch-id/","content":{"plain":"Protecting your phone from prying eyes with your fingerprint is great.

First rolled out last year for business users, Clutter is a lot like Gmail's priority inbox feature in that it automatically sorts messages based on what it predicts will be most important to you. Messages identified as unimportant are automatically sent to a separate folder that doesn't appear in the main inbox.\n\nMicrosoft is also launching its new \"add-ins\" feature, which allows third-party apps to run within Outlook. The feature, first previewed during the company's Build developer conference last month, works with Uber and email scheduling service Boomerang and PayPal right now. It is set to support more services in the future. It also works with Bing Maps and other productivity tools from Microsoft.\n\nOther inbox improvements include better search tools, link previews, inline image support, customizable color themes and pop windows for reading and composing new messages.\n\nSkype and OneDrive are also going to be more closely integrated with Outlook.com. Users can start Skype calls or chat with Skype contacts from within Outlook and easily switch between the two interfaces. You'll also be able to quickly convert email attachments into shareable links with OneDrive.\n\nFinally, Outlook.com's built-in calendar is getting a few tweaks with improved search features that make events searchable by name, attendees, location and description and easier navigation for people with multiple calendars."},"shares":{"facebook":292,"google_plus":62,"twitter":1223,"pinterest":6,"total":1583},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4chZXuT4wsnuWkX3hpa4J6y4KG8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F05%2F22%2F04%2Fmicroosft.1b57b.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0ilqDWxPVyBllIgbRmFDMiobY1A=/1438x0/2015%2F05%2F22%2F04%2Fmicroosft.1b57b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/34DyEgs1CNQNuMC8SVVMTJiM1YY=/356x205/2015%2F05%2F22%2F04%2Fmicroosft.1b57b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hHgHUvHsZlyRAmEC2PR1UfRCxvQ=/712x410/2015%2F05%2F22%2F04%2Fmicroosft.1b57b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XwPKE4d6TR0Kl3y9WfIm_r-HLwE=/280x157/2015%2F05%2F22%2F04%2Fmicroosft.1b57b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QRLLBn-Jxqhd4OuW_wpeCmxbeGU=/560x314/2015%2F05%2F22%2F04%2Fmicroosft.1b57b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1PZRoR7","display_title":"Microsoft's Outlook.com redesign includes new organization features","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/05/13/microsoft-windows-10-editions/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Microsoft is giving Outlook.com a pretty big facelift.\r\n","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"555cfacd97b2f874180019c6","id":"2015/05/20/microsoft-outlook-flow-app","title":"Microsoft's Outlook team is working on a chat-style email app called Flow","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2015-05-20T21:21:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 20 May 2015 21:21:07 +0000","formatted_date":"05/20/2015","formatted_shares":"1.4k","sort_key":"1yVbSu","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/05/20/microsoft-outlook-flow-app/","content":{"plain":"It looks like Microsoft has a new email app up its sleeve.\n\nThe team behind Outlook is working on an instant messaging-like email app for iPhone called Flow, according to a description of the app, which surfaced on Twitter. \n\nSee also: Windows 10 seems to run faster than OS X on the new MacBook\n\nFlow, which was first spotted by Twitter user h0x0d, is currently being tested internally at Microsoft, according to a leaked description from a download page.

Together, you can use Flow and Outlook interchangeably to participate in the same conversations.\n\nFast, fluid, natural conversations: No subject lines, salutations, or signatures.

In addition to Outlook.com and Exchange accounts, the app also supports Yahoo, iCloud and Gmail accounts as well as Box, Google Drive and Dropbox for storage. \n\nIf you were an Acompli user, the new Outlook app will feel very familiar, The core of what was Acompli is largely unchanged though touches like the \"quick filter\" and \"Sent from Outlook\" default signature, are thoroughly Microsoft.\n\nOutlook's inbox defaults to a so-called \"focused inbox\" view. That is a kind of priority inbox made up of a combination of all your connected email accounts. I didn't find the focused inbox filters to be quite as tight as Google's Priority Inbox, but as a feature I sorely missed in the original version of Acompli, it's a welcome addition. (You can also manually move messages to the focused inbox.)\n\nCalendar and location sharing shortcuts\n\nAs with Acompli before it, Outlook's built-in calendar is all about multitasking. If you spend a lot of time scheduling appointments and checking your availability, the calendar function will cut down on huge amounts of time that would have been spent switching between apps.\n\nThe calendar automatically syncs with the calendar tied to your email account and if you are subscribed to multiple calendars you can switch them on or off in the calendar menu.\n\nBut the best part of the calendar is using it to message your availability. While in a message, you can send your availability by tapping the calendar icon in the bottom right corner. Choose the appropriate day, select the time slots you're free and this info will automatically populated into a chart in the body of your message. \n\nLikewise, you can also send a map of your current whereabouts from within a message by selecting the maps icon. This automatically adds a quick snapshot of your locations, though it would be nice if you could add custom map locations as well. \n\nFiles and people\n\nThe app also has dedicated sections for files and people. Files displays all your recent attachments you've exchanged in all your email accounts and provides handy links to access files from your OneDrive, DropBox, Google Drive or Box account. \n\nThe people tab acts as a kind of \"favorites\" for the contacts you're in touch with most frequently. Tap into a particular name to see a list of all your most recent messages, meetings and files. It's a handy way to find a particular message when you can remember the sender but not the contents of a message.\n\nWhile the app is unquestionably a huge improvement over the Outlook Web App (which, as we've noted before, Acompli's own CEO trashed prior to joining Microsoft), I do have a few quibbles. \n\nWhile Acompli supported four different gestures for inbox organizations, Outlook only supports two. But the gestures are fully customizable and Outlook general manager Javier Soltero says this was done to keep things simple. You also can't select multiple messages at once, which seems like a given for an email app, particularly one aimed at a business-minded audience. (UPDATE: As someone pointed out in the comments, you can, in fact, select multiple emails by long pressing on a particular message in your inbox.)\n\nBut these shortcomings are relatively minor and Microsoft says the app will be updated weekly so it's likely the app will continue to improve with more updates. The new Outlook will also be coming to Windows devices with Windows 10, which was previewed during last week's Windows 10 event."},"shares":{"facebook":450,"twitter":1290,"google_plus":48,"pinterest":2,"total":1790},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p3o5C1EjMfgiJmDTpGbOgFIdsNg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F01%2F31%2F04%2FMicrosoft_O.00b06.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aO9Mn-w16VC1_2PeSF2PYw0HSTk=/1438x0/2015%2F01%2F31%2F04%2FMicrosoft_O.00b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MgANjp61WTmICl8ODxlroi-SfPU=/356x205/2015%2F01%2F31%2F04%2FMicrosoft_O.00b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KH3yAIu8Uo1_sST13frxuH2-czo=/712x410/2015%2F01%2F31%2F04%2FMicrosoft_O.00b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_4AFPhcpAkZuvbeJj5zwsr59mM0=/280x157/2015%2F01%2F31%2F04%2FMicrosoft_O.00b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6_nJJ463DJO1WqcODGz89rNjASk=/560x314/2015%2F01%2F31%2F04%2FMicrosoft_O.00b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1yFmbsW","display_title":"Getting started with the Microsoft Outlook app","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/01/29/microsoft-outlook-mobile-app/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"How to get the most out of Microsoft's new Outlook apps for iOS and Android.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"54c9ee0097b2f8469b006be5","id":"2015/01/29/microsoft-outlook-mobile-app","title":"Microsoft finally has an Outlook app that doesn't suck","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2015-01-29T08:23:16+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 08:23:16 +0000","formatted_date":"01/29/2015","formatted_shares":"3.4k","sort_key":"1ygKXI","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/01/29/microsoft-outlook-mobile-app/","content":{"plain":"Outlook users: the wait for a proper email app is over.

The app included a built-in calendar and features that made it easier to find attachments and contact information without digging through your inbox -- all of which carry over to the new Outlook-branded apps. \n\nThe apps also maintain support for non-Microsoft email accounts, so  Gmail and Yahoo users can continue to use the Outlook app -- as of Thursday Acompli's iOS and Android apps will redirect to Outlook.\n\n \n\nThe new apps will be welcome news to longtime Outlook users who until now largely relied on either third-party email apps or web apps. Previously, Microsoft technically had mobile versions of Outlook through its Outlook web app, OWA, which was available to iPhone and some Android users but it was far from ideal. The app was limited to Office 365's business users so those with outlook.com or personal accounts couldn't use the service and many found the user experience to be lacking.\n\n\"Let’s face it, OWA isn't even really an app,\" Acompli CEO Javier Soltero, who joined Microsoft following the acquisition, wrote last year. \"It’s a slow-loading web app wrapped in native Chrome.\"\n\nThe new Outlook app experience will also carry over to the touch-optimized version of Outlook for Windows 10. As with Microsoft's previous Android app releases, the first version of Outlook for Android will come with a \"preview\" label as Microsoft looks for feedback from users with different types of devices.\n\nSpeaking of \"preview\" apps, Microsoft is also removing the label from the Android tablet versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint apps, which were first announced in November.

(Connections to outlook.com and login.live.com, on the other hand, were not affected, according to a test performed by GreatFire.)\n\n才收敛了两三个月，又在玩 MITM 中间人攻击了……这次被攻击的是 Outlook 的 IMAP 大概其它协议也有 pic.twitter.com/ExilG1oQrs— 28小盆友 (@chengr28) January 17, 2015\n\n[Breaking News] Hotmail/Outlook IMAP/SMTP Man-in-the-middled in China. Self-signed certificate.— GreatFire.org (@GreatFireChina) January 17, 2015\n\n\"We once again suspect that Lu Wei and the Cyberspace Administration of China have orchestrated this attack or have willingly allowed the attack to happen,\" GreatFire wrote in its detailed analysis of the attack. \"If our accusation is correct, this new attack signals that the Chinese authorities are intent on further cracking down on communication methods that they cannot readily monitor.\"\n\nGreatFire reported that the attack used \"self-signed\" certificates to impersonate Outlook's server. Internet certificates are used to verify the identity of a website or, in this case, a server, and to ensure that the connection is secure and private. \n\nDigital certificates are normally issued by official and trusted certificate authorities. But they can also be issued by a site or service certifying its own identity. These are called self-signed certificates, which usually prompt browsers and email clients to display a warning, since a self-signed certificate can be a sign of an MITM attack.\n\nMicrosoft confirmed the attack in a statement, but declined to answer any questions about it.\n\n\"We are aware of a small number of customers impacted by malicious routing to a server impersonating Outlook.com,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Mashable in an email. \"If a customer sees a certificate warning, they should contact their Internet service provider for assistance.\"\n\nThe attack lasted only a day, but was still \"especially devious\" because users are more likely to ignore warning messages using email clients (such as the one below) than they are when using browsers like Chrome or Firefox, GreatFire said.\n\nThis new attack comes roughly three months after the Chinese government allegedly attacked Microsoft users trying to log in via Hotmail.com and Live.com, as well as iCloud users, trying to steal their credentials. A similar MITM attack on Yahoo was also reported in late September, during the protests in Hong Kong. \n\n\"This continues a pattern of organized MITM attacks on major communications platforms,\" Michael Carbone, a technologist at the human rights organization Access, told Mashable. \n\nCarbone stressed that users in China should not ignore any warnings, because these attacks could expose their personal information and communications. \n\n\"Users should take seriously any warnings raised by their email clients or web browsers, and seek to use access tools like VPNs, Tor, Lantern, Psiphon or others if they continue to run into these warnings as a way to better secure their communications,\" he said in an email.\n\nIt's unclear if the Chinese government was really behind the attack, but experts believe that MITM attacks like this one can only be performed by telecom providers or a government. \n\nThe motive behind the attack is also unclear, but GreatFire speculated that China might be testing its MITM capabilities, and gauging whether users fall for this kind of attack despite the warnings to figure out how effective these attacks can be.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Chinese browsers such as Baidu's or Qihoo's only display smaller warnings in these cases, according to Percy Alpha, one of the activists at GreatFire, making them less safe than Chrome or Firefox, which display full page warnings. \n\nGreatFire is also asking tech companies to revoke trust on China's certificate authority, the CNNIC (China Internet Network Information Center), in case the Chinese government decides to use this organization to issue legitimate-looking certificates that wouldn't prompt browsers or clients to display warnings.\n\nThis would allow China to \"better impersonate\" Internet services and monitor them, according to Carbone. \"It is something of a 'nuclear option,'\" Carbone added, as using this strategy would probably force major web browsers and operating systems to blacklist the CNNIC and other Chinese certificate authorities. \n\nMashable was unable to reach out to the Cyberspace Administration of China, and China's embassy in Washington D.C. did not answer to a request for comment. \n\nUPDATE, Jan. 22, 6:51 p.m. ET: The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) denied having anything to do with the incident on Thursday, according to a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency.\n\nCAC spokesman Jiang Jun said the allegations that China attacked Outlook are \"groundless slander\" and aim to \"incite dissatisfaction and smear China's cyberspace management system.\""},"shares":{"twitter":684,"facebook":82,"google_plus":17,"total":783},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TN2SGx3jDjGa_JI4I9Ke9Kmc1dw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F01%2F23%2F03%2Fchinaandout.96220.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PEJDrlf2_QZc-mBAGBBF25b5zmI=/1438x0/2015%2F01%2F23%2F03%2Fchinaandout.96220.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1p97L-tozAAVCC9DvsdkRkHXh4s=/356x205/2015%2F01%2F23%2F03%2Fchinaandout.96220.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4RRmcd07i1O_E_HFuVOyOC8Bw88=/712x410/2015%2F01%2F23%2F03%2Fchinaandout.96220.jpg","query":"(min-resolution:

How Satya Nadella plans to win the next\n\nFirst previewed at Microsoft's Exchange Conference earlier this year, Clutter aims to help users separate their most important email from everything else.\n\nMuch like Google's Priority Inbox for Gmail, it learns from your actions over time to surface the most important email while weeding out the messages it thinks you're most likely to ignore.

Businesses participating in the company's First Release program will be the first to get the tool, which can be enabled from the Outlook Web App options menu.

Outlook.com now contains a messaging section at the bottom-left corner of the inbox, where users can find their recent conversations, and see which of their contacts are online. What's more, users can also send messages over Skype, Facebook or Messenger, and switch between the three options, from within Outlook.com.\n\nThe new Outlook.com makes replying to messages a lot easier by adding in-line reply. Previously, users couldn't respond to emails without opening a new view. \n\nMicrosoft also added an undo button (ctrl+z works) that allows users to undo certain actions, including delete, categorize, flag, mark as junk or move. \n\nThe new features will be rolling out gradually over the next few weeks."},"shares":{"linked_in":230,"facebook":227,"google_plus":68,"twitter":765,"pinterest":3,"total":1293},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MBjSPrw7Ll3mR6DomzDemPM0rlw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2014%2F05%2F14%2F7a%2Foutlook.com.b77bf.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RXUX28foQ6lJLRfZXahZ0Ww_7AY=/1438x0/2014%2F05%2F14%2F7a%2Foutlook.com.b77bf.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6XdSNsqIfXGRO67a74kqeRNlpEs=/356x205/2014%2F05%2F14%2F7a%2Foutlook.com.b77bf.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bZwsAb_hVL4ABg9cUPnq4ZZnq8w=/712x410/2014%2F05%2F14%2F7a%2Foutlook.com.b77bf.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/u6fn32k1zTIAqR7ZNJXYFue01Fg=/280x157/2014%2F05%2F14%2F7a%2Foutlook.com.b77bf.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Lo4S_77b3FjKsDnDjUJKSCT4OJI=/560x314/2014%2F05%2F14%2F7a%2Foutlook.com.b77bf.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1gBzaV1","display_title":"Outlook.com Rolls Out New Features, Looks More Like Gmail","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"microsoft-2013-milestones"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Microsoft added new features to Outlook.com on Tuesday, making its email client look much more like Gmail.

It is embedded in its entirety at the bottom of this post.\n\nA new court filing details the extraordinary lengths Microsoft is willing to go in order to protect its intellectual property: Accessing a blogger's private Hotmail and chat data.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was first reported that Alex Kibkalo, a former Microsoft employee, is facing federal criminal charges over allegations that he stole trade secrets while working for the company. \n\nSee also: Did the FBI Lean On Microsoft for Access to Its Encryption Software?\n\nAccording to an indictment in the criminal complaint, Kibkalo \"uploaded proprietary software and pre-release software updates for Windows 8 RT as well as the Microsoft Activation Server Software Development Kit (SDK)\" to his personal SkyDrive (now OneDrive) account in August 2012. The interesting part of this story is how Microsoft fingered Kibkalo for the leak.\n\nOn Sept. 3, 2012, Steven Sinofsky, who was then the president of Microsoft's Windows division, received an email from an unnamed source. The source had received some code from a French blogger -- known in the Windows community for leaking screenshots and early software releases -- that he thought Sinofsky needed to see.\n\nIt turned out this code was sample code from the Microsoft Server SDK. Sinofsky turned the information over to the Trustworthy Computing Investigations (TWCI), the department within Microsoft that is tasked with protecting the company from external and internal security threats.\n\nAfter talking to the TWCI, the source revealed the email address of the blogger that sent him the code. It turns out, the TWCI was already aware of the blogger and had been trying to discover his identity. \n\nConveniently for Microsoft, the blogger used a Hotmail account for his communications. This meant that Microsoft could access his account -- even without a court order.\n\nHow is that possible? Well, a provision in Microsoft's privacy policy very clearly states that the company can access your accounts in order to \"protect the rights or property of Microsoft\" or its customers.\n\nThe entire provision reads (emphasis ours):\n\nWe may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers or the public.\n\nThe blogger's access to proprietary Microsoft code, gave Microsoft justification to gain entry to his Microsoft accounts.\n\nAccording to the court documents, on Sept. 7, 2012, Microsoft's Office of Legal Compliance \"approved content pulls of the blogger's Hotmail account.\" \n\nWhile accessing the blogger's email, Microsoft tracked down communications between the blogger and then-employee Kibkalo. This included messages with links to Kibkalo's personal OneDrive account, which contained the leaked data.\n\nThat revelation led to a subsequent investigation -- which included an interview with Kibkalo -- where, according to court documents, he admitted leaking Microsoft code to outsiders. \n\nIn a statement to Mashable, Microsoft defended its action when it came to accessing the blogger's data.\n\nA Microsoft spokesperson says:\n\n  \"During an investigation of an employee we discovered evidence that the employee was providing stolen IP, including code relating to our activation process, to a third party. In order to protect our customers and the security and integrity of our products, we conducted an investigation over many months with law enforcement agencies in multiple countries. This included the issuance of a court order for the search of a home relating to evidence of the criminal acts involved. The investigation repeatedly identified clear evidence that the third party involved intended to sell Microsoft IP and had done so in the past.\n\nAs part of the investigation, we took the step of a limited review of this third party's Microsoft operated accounts. While Microsoft's terms of service make clear our permission for this type of review, this happens only in the most exceptional circumstances. We apply a rigorous process before reviewing such content. In this case, there was a thorough review by a legal team separate from the investigating team and strong evidence of a criminal act that met a standard comparable to that required to obtain a legal order to search other sites. In fact, as noted above, such a court order was issued in other aspects of the investigation\"\n\nOK, so this seems legal -- or at least in compliance with Microsoft's privacy policy -- but is it ethical? At the very least, we must recognize the irony in Microsoft going to the lengths of accessing a user's account in order to track down the source of a leak.\n\nAfter all, this is the same company that launched an anti-Google \"Scroogled\" ad-campaign, criticizing its rival's privacy and data collection policies. \n\nIt's also a reminder that even without the NSA, technology companies can access your data. \n\nIt's interesting to note is that Microsoft was able to access the blogger's email, specifically because this incident concerned Microsoft software. If the leaked data was source code from Google or Apple or another company, Microsoft would be unable to intervene -- at least without a court order.\n\nThis incident also points out an important lesson: If you want to anonymously leak information about a company, think twice before using that company's products for your communications.\n\n   USA vs Alex Kibkalo\n\n   Microsoft Statement"},"shares":{"facebook":178,"twitter":866,"google_plus":26,"linked_in":65,"total":1135},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mfFZ9lEtJ5vJRBEpoC58e2aPFt0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2014%2F03%2F21%2F1e%2Fmicrosoftlo.8952b.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3HJwIq7dyOJmNB41SR5HCQ8zbGc=/1438x0/2014%2F03%2F21%2F1e%2Fmicrosoftlo.8952b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0JVTagGSZHadJWFexPlyRBiUHCI=/356x205/2014%2F03%2F21%2F1e%2Fmicrosoftlo.8952b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vAMi4ADYezk-4CAzMGOhChxmjtE=/712x410/2014%2F03%2F21%2F1e%2Fmicrosoftlo.8952b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ee354IFNrZYQoLGTnLX4Nt5EFy4=/280x157/2014%2F03%2F21%2F1e%2Fmicrosoftlo.8952b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ew0Wzss8XppCbBXN6cNExIPgzeQ=/560x314/2014%2F03%2F21%2F1e%2Fmicrosoftlo.8952b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/OFI6AT","display_title":"Microsoft Tracks Down Rogue Employee By Snooping Blogger's Hotmail","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/09/11/fbi-microsoft-bitlocker-backdoor/"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"UPDATE, March 20, 2010 9PM EST: Microsoft VP and Deputy General Counsel John Frank has issued a statement offering more insight into this situation and its policies concerning user privacy.

First, you will need to sign up for an Outlook.com account (if you don't already have one). \n\n\"This will import your Gmail emails into your Outlook.com inbox and, because you've connected both accounts, your Google contacts will automatically appear in Outlook.com,\" Microsoft said. \"The structure of your inbox, including read/unread status of your emails, will be preserved. The new tool will even set up your Gmail address as a 'send-only' account so you can continue to send email from your @gmail.com address, right from Outlook.com, if you still want to.\"\n\nIt's also possible to forward Gmail email to your Outlook.com account (see image below). For a full look at the steps -- and to start the importing process -- click here.\n\nMicrosoft emphasized in the announcement a \"discontent with Gmail seems to be on the rise.\" It cited a recent survey conducted by market research firm Ipsos that found nearly 1 in 4 consumers would switch email providers if it was easier to do. Study respondents said seeings ads don't interfere with checking email (70%) was very important to the overall experience, followed by advanced spam filters (69%) and an easy-to-understand user interface (67%).\n\nOf course, Microsoft says Outlook.com has all of these things, so switching to the platform is \"a natural choice.\"\n\nThe tool comes as Yahoo Mail suffered a massive outage that left some users without email access for days. Microsoft would be wise to open up the important tool to those users too. \n\nBonus: A Tour of Outlook.com\n\nImage: Microsoft"},"shares":{"facebook":283,"twitter":709,"linked_in":56,"google_plus":29,"pinterest":8,"total":1085},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8F_wqNthM-3SnjgjFWsDnENCf8Y=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2013%2F12%2F13%2F77%2Foutlookgrad.b32fe.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7-6Ul9H8d5NZ-7oSuXnnEZF9lVs=/1438x0/2013%2F12%2F13%2F77%2Foutlookgrad.b32fe.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7wc6w0eJ3yHtyW9Lv1hFtigrkZo=/356x205/2013%2F12%2F13%2F77%2Foutlookgrad.b32fe.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CZaINg8PuDO1qEkY-1Tadgk66GU=/712x410/2013%2F12%2F13%2F77%2Foutlookgrad.b32fe.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PFOX6CdYCJo9cTbQd7LNtlNTH38=/280x157/2013%2F12%2F13%2F77%2Foutlookgrad.b32fe.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/665hY8MvqtOzJjDE6jxPtRjKPv8=/560x314/2013%2F12%2F13%2F77%2Foutlookgrad.b32fe.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1kH0wKQ","display_title":"Microsoft Lures Gmail Users With Outlook.com Import Tool","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[{"data-id":6781,"class":"content-gallery"}]},"excerpt":"For those who want to switch email providers -- we're looking at you, Yahoo Mail users affected by this week's massive outage -- there hasn't been a seamless way to do so.

It has a fleet of flying robots capable of shooting missiles at enemy targets. It has engineered computer viruses that can inflict physical damage. And soon, the U.S. Air Force could have laser missiles.\n\nSee also: The U.S. Army Is Building an 'Iron Man' Suit for Soldiers\n\nYet the military, like many bureaucracies, is slow to evolve. In this case, it's resulted in some old tools being used right alongside the world's most advanced weaponry. We've listed seven outdated technologies still used by American armed forces, below.\r\nThe M4 Carbine\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThe M4 carbine is the U.S. Army's primary infantry weapon, and it is a quarter of a century old. Like a lot of older technology, better things have already come along, but the military has not issued a replacement carbine on a wide scale. The M4A1, which provides soldiers with better accuracy, a more consistent trigger pull and a fully automatic firing speed, according to Military.com, has been used by special forces soldiers for about 10 years.\n\nAnd although the Army plans to buy 12,000 more in 2014 for regular troops, that will hardly make a dent in the half a million M4s in use today. The Army did launch a competition for companies to design its next generation carbine, but that contest has since been canceled.\r\nMicrosoft Outlook\n\nImage: Flickr, ALA staff\n\nHarmless though it may seem, Microsoft Outlook wastes countless hours every year for military employees who have to spend time each day culling their email inbox due to lack of storage space. Gmail accounts would provide 60 times more room.\r\nB61 Nuclear Bomb\n\nImage: Flickr, Peter\n\nAmerica's B61 nuclear bomb has many variants stationed in military bases across Europe, all of which are Cold War relics, according to German news organization Der Spiegel. But the U.S. has no plans to dismantle or remove them. Instead, they are going to upgrade them into the B61-12, a bomb that will actually pack less TNT than its predecessors because it will presumably be so accurate that the extra explosiveness would be unnecessary.\n\nThese futuristic nukes, expected to be ready by 2020, are considered by some to be a new type of weapon, the development of which would contrast President Barack Obama's decree to not engineer new nuclear explosives.\r\nThe Army's Enemy Position-Analyzer\n\nImage: Flickr, U.S. Army\n\nThe U.S. military's Distributed Common Grounds System, or DCGS-A (pronounced dee-sigs-a), as it is known, is a multi-billion dollar system designed to procure, analyze and distribute information about the location of enemy combatants to American soldiers fighting overseas. It is supposed to collect this information from various intelligence sources in order to provide soldiers with information that will help them assess the dangerousness of a particular area, collect data about insurgents' movements on certain days and overall patterns in enemy behavior. The system is supposed to save lives.\n\nThe problem, according to The New Republic, is that it doesn't do any of that.\n\nBut analyzing enemy movements in near real-time can be done, and experienced soldiers know it. One of the soldiers currently using DCGS-A discovered a Palo Alto company called Palantir that, according to the The New Republic article, has the ability to piece together data about enemy behavior at a level of detail he had never before seen. Nevertheless, the Pentagon has yet to make a change.\r\nM9 Pistol\n\nImage: Wikimedia Commons\n\nLike the M4 carbine, the M9 pistol is 25 years old, and similar, but better, weapons are readily available. Well over 200,000 U.S. soldiers use this type of gun, and many have a laundry list of complaints about the weapon.\n\nTroops can't attach lights or lasers to the gun, the safety lock that prevents someone from accidentally firing the M9 is located on the opposite end of the barrel (causing soldiers to accidentally activate it when they reload), silencers don't fit on the weapon's muzzle and many complain that the M9 is not lethal enough.\n\nPlenty of commercially available guns, such as the M&P, designed by firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson, are free of such problems. Currently, the M&P, as well as a few other gun models, are contestants in a competition to replace the Army's outdated pistol. Testing of new handguns will start next year.\r\nThe Military's Videoconferencing Tool\n\nImage: Flickr, United States Mission Geneva\n\nThe Pentagon's videoconference system of choice is literally called Video Teleconferencing, a Tandberg product, which, according to former Air Force intelligence enlistee Adam Simmons, is far from up-to-date.\n\n\"The cameras are overly expensive and they require [the company's] hardware and software to use,\" Simmons told Mashable in an email. \"This system was revolutionary 10-15 years ago, but quickly became obsolete with PC webcams and free video conferencing tools used in instant messaging applications.\"\n\nDue to security concerns, not all of those free tools can be used inside the Department of Defense, but Simmons says that Adobe Connect would do just fine. Unfortunately for soldiers, Simmons also says that Adobe Connect is \"something many [government] personnel just plain don't know about.\"\r\nBlackBerry Devices\n\nImage: Flickr, VancityAllie.com\n\nBlackberry phones have long been touted as having better security than their counterparts at Apple and Samsung. That's why the Department of Defense allowed the company to provide their smartphones, and why the agency still has 470,000 of them, according to Defense One.\n\nBut in recent times, Blackberry has faltered in the security arena, as well as several others, leading to widespread speculation that the company may not be around much longer. In case the company does eventually close its doors, the Pentagon is developing its own system that would secure all employee mobile devices.\n\nImage: Flickr, Chris Devers"},"shares":{"facebook":663,"twitter":864,"linked_in":44,"google_plus":39,"stumble_upon":118,"pinterest":2,"total":1730},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/02t7IRMsod7SAPQEUvhWgZ16v5o=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2013%2F12%2F02%2F80%2Fplane1.436c0.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZOYAmtTBQb6CHp0G3Mou7ENtI2A=/1438x0/2013%2F12%2F02%2F80%2Fplane1.436c0.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/J0JnoXPXGAW0xUtEJ5nw81P0rPg=/356x205/2013%2F12%2F02%2F80%2Fplane1.436c0.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mmmweRE52jZmR1av0MpJexR2nBk=/712x410/2013%2F12%2F02%2F80%2Fplane1.436c0.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RePBj9-Ko-YhdTetWZA2-6toaEQ=/280x157/2013%2F12%2F02%2F80%2Fplane1.436c0.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZFM-0mLgl6nJylMMNGp4bQkHQaY=/560x314/2013%2F12%2F02%2F80%2Fplane1.436c0.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/IzpU8N","display_title":"7 Outdated Technologies the U.S. Military Still Uses","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/10/13/us-army-iron-man-suit/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The U.S. military is the proud owner of some of the world's most advanced technology.

Anyone working in publishing in the 1990s and early 2000s saw Aldus PageMaker give way to QuarkXPress, which eventually ceded to Adobe InDesign. No matter how good any app may be at a given time, technology doesn't stop advancing, which in turn changes people's needs. That opens up opportunities for more nimble competitors to win over customers with apps that better serve those needs.\n\nUntil recently, Microsoft Office has been fairly immune to this cycle. It's been a mainstay of productivity software for more than 20 years -- if you've worked with electronic documents at all, chances are you're more than familiar with it.\n\nHowever, the rise of mobile devices and cloud computing allows competitors to chip away at the office empire. Many people now turn to free and mobile-friendly alternatives, like Google Drive or QuickOffice for building documents, spreadsheets and presentations.\n\nBut there's a reason Office was the go-to productivity software for more than two decades: Microsoft can adapt. And it's doing so in a big way for the next version of Office, called Office 2013, which works hand in hand with Windows 8, set for a big debut this fall. Windows 8 re-invents the computing experience for touch screens, social networks and the cloud -- and the new Office takes full advantage of that modern tech trinity.\n\n\"It's going to start with how people get Office,\" says P.J. Hough, Microsoft's vice president of Office program management. \"We're going to stream Office to every user. We've done a lot of work to make the streaming incredibly fast. It's single-digit minutes to get Office installed and up and running on your computer.\"\n\nOffice 2013 doesn't just download once and rest on your computer, either. Hough says the new Office will be as much as service as an app, with continual updates via the network. Microsoft's also changing the how it sells the software -- instead of buying it once, users will now subscribe, with different plans for personal and business use.\n\n\"It actually changes the relationship with the customer,\" Hough says. \"Your computer stops owning Office and you personally own Office. If you get a new computer and you're a subscriber, office goes on the new computer. I go to office.com, I sign in, I say I want Office on this computer and we stream it down.\"\n\nThe cloud also plays a big role in Office 2013. The default location for all saved documents will now be Microsoft's cloud-storage service, SkyDrive, so you'll be able to pick up documents right where you left off when you switch machines. In addition, content-based features that used to be delivered locally, such as document templates for Word and PowerPoint, will now be powered by the cloud.\n\n\"We've already done a lot of this work with Office 365, our enterprise offering, but this is taking that same cloud-driven view of Office to the consumer\" says Hough. \"[Office 2013] is backed by relevant services -- SkyDrive, Skype -- so we think there's an equivalent experience that I want as a consumer, that's online and connected.\"\n\nHowever, Hough stresses that Office 2013 works just as you'd expect when you're offline. The apps are installed locally, and work will get saved even if you're off the network and set up to save to SkyDrive.\n\nThe re-invented Office also integrates social networks much more closely. While in previous years, social networking may have been looked at as a distraction from productivity, it's become clear that Microsoft sees the value in being able to easily connect with contacts, colleagues and collaborators.\n\n\"Sometimes, the way that I get work done is not by starting work on an artefact, but by finding a person first,\" Hough says. \"Our acquisition of Yammer is yet more evidence of the merging together of social with productivity. They're not two separate things. It's not a waste of time to have a feed that shows you what people are working on or lets you get in touch with people easily.\"\n\nIt's Outlook that exhibits Office's new social abilities the most, calling up a contact's schedule and recent projects when you address them in an email. But Word and PowerPoint are more social, too, with improved ways to collaborate on documents with better organized footnotes and a streamlined Track Changes feature.\n\nFinally, there was the hardware to consider. The new Office is made to work on both traditional PCs as well as tablets. That includes both full-functioning Windows tablets -- which will run old Windows 7 apps -- and the new Windows RT devices, which will come with a free version of Office. However, to unlock many abilities, such as seamless saving to the cloud, you'll need to subscribe.\n\nThe big change in a tablet environment is the inclusion of touch interfaces. PowerPoint, for example, now supports pinch to zoom and typical gestures. The backbone of Office 2013 also benefits from improvements in Windows 8 to make sure apps respond quickly and properly to every tap and swipe.\n\n\"We've made a bet this time around in Office on graphics hardware acceleration -- work that the Windows team did in Windows 7 that they've really doubled down on in Windows 8,\" Hough says. \"It's allowed us to build a set of apps in Office that are responsive and fluid.\"\n\nAre all these improvements enough to keep competitors at bay and ensure Microsoft Office dominates for another decade? That's the plan, and Microsoft has included many new features in Office 2013 -- such as Excel predicting exactly what table you want and apps that can integrate real-time data -- that competitors will find tough to match.\n\nHas Office 2013 impressed you?

I should know -- I've been using Hotmail as my primary email since I first got an account in 1999.\n\nI wish I could say that I never looked back, but when I saw all of my friends and professional colleagues touting their Gmail addresses in the mid-2000s, I considered switching. Certainly, I created and maintained a Gmail account, but I decided all those years ago that I wanted an email that wouldn't change, so I stuck with Microsoft's Hotmail, despite its poor storage capacity and the torrents of spam.\n\nTo anyone without that interest in email permanence, Gmail was an easy choice. Its clean layout, easy archiving and seemingly endless storage wooed many digital influencers and their followers. Although Hotmail always bragged more overall users, everybody in the know had figured out that Gmail simply outclassed Hotmail in pretty much every way that mattered.\n\nAs time went on, Microsoft added new features to Hotmail and caught up with Gmail in many respects. But the damage was done. Even after Hotmail offered nearly unlimited storage, much improved spam filtering and useful inbox-cleanup features, the stigma remained. If you saw the @hotmail.com domain in someone's reply-to field, it necessitated a tsk-tsk -- or at least a roll of the eyes. You have to wonder how many resumes were thrown in the trash at tech companies because the applicant had put a Hotmail address in their contact info. Gmail won.\n\nThen: Boom. Last month, Microsoft changed the game, re-launching Hotmail as Outlook.com, casting aside its tarnished brand and giving the service a major makeover, along with some game-changing new features.\n\nIs it as good as Gmail, though? Where does each service excel, or fall down? And will the switch to Outlook for web mail finally enable Microsoft to cast off the stigma of Hotmail? Let's look closer.\n\nMessages\n\nThe absolute basic basics of the two programs -- composing messages -- is actually fairly different between the two services. Gmail opens up a clean message but retains the Gmail template, with your labels and chat contacts on the side. Outlook, on the other hand, brings you to a compose page where it's just you and your email.\n\nThe Gmail approach is more versatile. While you're writing your message, you can click away at any time and Gmail will automatically save a draft. Outlook instead simply gives you a warning that you haven't yet saved your draft if you try to leave before hitting send. That makes saving drafts a two-step process -- slightly more inconvenient.\n\nThe idea of getting shunted to a dedicated composition page has some merit. When replying to long email chains, for example, you'll inherently see more of the message on your screen.\n\nOutlook doesn't offer as powerful editing tools as Gmail does, though. While both programs will let you compose messages in rich or plain text, Gmail has a Clear Formatting button, which I've found extremely useful whenever I need to copy-and-paste some text into an email. Outlook.com lacks this feature, although it can do something else Gmail can't: setting message priority (although I've always found it more effective to simply put \"URGENT\" in a subject).\n\nOutlook, however, adds a very nice aesthetic touch to the act of sending an email. When you hit Send, the message shrinks within the window for a second, then moves upward slightly (sucked into the \"tubes\" of the Internet) right before the app tosses you back to your Inbox.\n\nWinner: Gmail\n\nSocial Integration\n\nGoogle is doing its best to become a heavyweight among social networks, and it shows. Gmail is hard-wired into Google+, showing you notifications and your G+ profile pic in the top right at all times. It's always been a one-click experience to start IMing with someone via GChat, or a voice call via GTalk, on the left rail. Finally, Gmail just integrated Google+ hangouts into Gmail in lieu of the old video chats.\n\nStill, that's about as far as it goes. Given the areas they compete in, Google has fairly icy relations with Twitter and Facebook, so you won't see them here. But Outlook.com ties into both of those services in a fairly novel way.\n\nIn Outlook, whenever you click on a message from an actual person (as opposed to a newsletter or notification) you'll see the latest updates from that person's Twitter and Facebook feeds on the side. You can even Like and retweet posts without ever leaving Outlook.com.\n\nSure, Gmail will show you Google+ profile information of the person you're emailing, but that's about it. Seemingly, Outlook wins here except it so far has no integrated way to start a video or voice chat with someone (regular IMing has always been integrated with Windows Live Messenger). Microsoft says Skype will fill this gap, but the feature has yet to appear.\n\nWinner: Draw\n\nAds\n\nAds are annoying -- unless of course the ad is advertising something you actually want. To my recollection, I've never once clicked on an email ad (whether text or display), so that either says those ads do a bad job of doing that, or they're simply not noticeable enough for it to matter.\n\nIn its Outlook metamorphosis, Hotmail ditched display ads in favor of text ads along the right side. This made it more like Gmail, although there are a few differences. For one, the Outlook ads are visible even when you're just looking at your Inbox; on Gmail, they only appear when you have a message open.\n\nMore importantly, the ads disappear on Outlook when you select one of those messages from an actual person, replaced by the social-network info mentioned above. Gmail shows you ads on all messages.\n\nThe third difference is in how you actually interact with the ads. If you mouseover one on Outlook, an image appears over it. That could be of interest to advertisers, since it seems to be designed to increase engagement, although it's too early to say whether it's effective.\n\nFinally, although few will take advantage of it, Outlook.com still offers the old Hotmail Plus service of doing away with the ads entirely for a yearly fee. You'll need to switch back to the old Hotmail to sign up, but once you do you can switch back to Outlook and never see an ad again. Gmail has no such option.\n\nWinner: Outlook\n\nSecurity\n\nThis one is really no contest. Gmail offers two-factor authentication, and Outlook.com doesn't. The word \"security\" doesn't even appear on Outlook's options page.\n\nWhen I asked Microsoft why it didn't offer two-factor authentication for Outlook, a company spokesperson reminded me the service was technically still in preview, and that it required strong passwords and had \"good server-side detection.\"\n\nThe rep also said Microsoft was researching security issues while in preview so it could find a \"strong solution that everyone could use\" as opposed to \"just the 1% of users that figure out how to navigate a bunch of additional setup options.\" (More info in this story.)\n\nSo perhaps Outlook's security will get better in the near future, but for now, if you want a secure, free web email service, that's Gmail.\n\nWinner: Gmail\n\nOrganizing\n\nFor most of Hotmail's history, superior organizing tools are what it held highest over Gmail. For anyone thrown by Gmail's use of \"labels,\" Hotmail's more-familiar folders and its ability to rearrange your inbox (or any folder) by date, sender, subject or size with a single click were beacons of normality.\n\nThat still holds true with Outlook. Folders remain the primary way to organize your email, and it also retains Categories, which automatically classify your incoming messages as \"social updates\" or \"newsletters,\" for example.\n\nOutlook's tools aren't just there to satisfy left-brainers, however. The service also arms you with a few tools that help you keep overloaded inboxes under control. First it offers a quick way to \"Sweep\" up all messages from a sender or senders, deleting (or moving) each and every one of them.\n\nIt also provides an easy way to schedule cleanups -- say, deleting all notifications from Twitter or Facebook every few days, negating the need to even remember to Sweep. Although Gmail offers a Priority Inbox feature that comes in handy for putting important messages front and center, it doesn't have anything comparable to a scheduled cleanup.\n\nFinally, there's the simple Preview Pane, a standard feature on Outlook that you have to enable through the \"Labs\" tab in your Gmail settings to enable. While Hotmail/Outlook has borrowed the best features from Gmail over the years -- such as free integration with mobile email clients and conversation view -- I don't understand why Gmail hasn't implemented this feature, which I view as fundamental to any email client.\n\nWinner: Outlook\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAnd so the final score is two points per side -- a tie. While Outlook.com has a lot going for it, and it's a huge leap forward for Microsoft just in terms of brand, Gmail is still superior in some key ways (security being the biggie). But Outlook.com represents a rebirth of Microsoft's web mail service, and the company appears to be investing much more into it with the launch. Perhaps a rematch will yield different results in a few months.\n\nIn any case, the rebranding of Hotmail as Outlook.com has given users of Gmail and Yahoo Mail a reason to try something new. Even better, it's given them an email address they don't have to be embarrassed about.\n\nImage courtesy of Adamlmhotep."},"shares":{"google_plus":357,"facebook":262,"linked_in":376,"pinterest":12,"twitter":1658,"stumble_upon":32,"total":2697},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XNfGYI7_xeqRwE2FAkk-oPSFJqM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2012%2F12%2F04%2F54%2Femailsmackd.azb.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MTO1v3Tehu127Txo8z8A04_bGUA=/1438x0/2012%2F12%2F04%2F54%2Femailsmackd.azb.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_dQ0vWslF9EzVw3V3U_FJG61wWc=/356x205/2012%2F12%2F04%2F54%2Femailsmackd.azb.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-4JhB0n200MZc1SPPZXf53Qb7mg=/712x410/2012%2F12%2F04%2F54%2Femailsmackd.azb.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7FE_dqIN8tdcPmKrGP6Qh_fNf5I=/280x157/2012%2F12%2F04%2F54%2Femailsmackd.azb.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GtT1PIaKV6Wdn9ns4T17UbOm4Go=/560x314/2012%2F12%2F04%2F54%2Femailsmackd.azb.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/Pa4780","display_title":"Email Smackdown: Outlook.com vs. Gmail","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Let's be honest: For a long time, it was a little embarrassing to use a Hotmail address.

Not only is the entire interface changing to make it more in line with Windows 8 and touchscreen devices like tablets, it's also changing the way users can customize Office, bringing apps into the picture.\n\nWait a second -- isn't Office already an app (actually, a suite of apps)? Yes, the concept of Office apps is a little weird, but the idea is applying the app model to things users have been doing for a long time; for example, writing their own macros and designing add-ons.\n\nApps change the picture in three key ways:\n\nUsers and developers will be able to more easily create customizations, and Microsoft has set up a whole site to walk them through it.\r\nThey'll be able to share them with all Office users (who Microsoft says number at 1 billion).\r\nAnd they can now easily make money by selling them in the Office Store (which opened yesterday).\n\nOne example of an Office app would be a heat map for Excel. Say you have some geographic data, such as the number of waterslides in every U.S. state. With a mapping app installed (surprise, Bing has one), you can plot that data on a map -- with colors or different-size circles graphically representing the data -- right in the spreadsheet.\n\nThe question then becomes: What happens when I share that spreadsheet? The app actually travels with the document, and it's up to the developer what the recipient will see when they open it. They'll either have the option to download the app from the Office Store for free, start a free trial or be shuttled to a payment screen.\n\nSEE ALSO: Microsoft Office 2013: A Touchscreen, 21st Century Upgrade [HANDS-ON]\n\nWith Office's cloud abilities, it's also easy for an IT department to create a set of apps for everyone at a business. When those employees go to the Office Store, they'll see their company's apps under My Organization. The apps that you personally have downloaded will appear under My Apps.\n\nMicrosoft sees this as an easy way to build up a catalog of Office enhancements as well as being another way for developers -- or even people who may have created customizations and never thought of themselves as developers -- to make some money. The revenue split is more favorable than other app models, with an 80/20 split (the devs take 80%).\n\nAmong the new apps, the most impressive ones are for Excel since there is no end to creative ways to graphically represent data. Microsoft has created an extensive Medal Tracker app for the Olympics to showcase what Office apps can do. Accessing Olympic data that's continually updated, the app can render it in many ways, including showing world countries as bunch of bouncing circles of varying size.\n\nHow do you like Microsoft's approach to apps in Office 2013? Do you think you'll try any? Do you have a customization like a Word macro that you're excited to share?

Launched in 1996, Hotmail was bought by Microsoft the following year, and the service has gone through myriad changes since then. Today, Microsoft is making its most radical change yet to the 16-year-old email service.\n\nFor starters, the Hotmail brand is toast. Microsoft is rebranding the service under the Outlook banner, moving the service to Outlook.com. The Hotmail site will still be there, and users won't be forced to make the switch -- yet -- but the message is clear: Going forward, Microsoft email is called Outlook. You'll still be able to keep your Hotmail address, and even use it as the one all your friends and family reply to, but your account will be an Outlook.com account.\n\nEmail Ads, the Microsoft Way\n\nAlso getting thrown out: the business model. Hotmail stood apart from other free-email services such as Gmail by building display ads into the page, forcing users to look at them. While the ads have been a (small) source of revenue for Microsoft, they've held back the service in many ways. Most notably: Hotmail arrived on mobile email apps late -- and kicking and screaming -- since once the service is integrated, display ads aren't visible.\n\nBut now Microsoft is literally pushing those display ads aside, replacing them with Google-like keyword-based text ads that run along the right side of your message pane. Those ads will be tailored to you based on personal data, and they'll get even more specific when you click on a message.\n\n\"Wait a second,\" you say. \"Isn't this kind of ad targeting exactly what Microsoft criticized Google of doing in amusing ads like 'Gmail Man.'\" Absolutely true, but Microsoft gives itself a get-out-of-jail-free card: It will only serve you and ad within a message when it's a newsletter or some other form of \"official\" communication (like from your bank). For person-to-person emails, the ads disappear in lieu of something else.\n\nNew Features\n\nThat something else being one of Hotm... er, Outlook's most interesting new features: social integration. For whomever you're conversing with, Outlook imports their most recent tweets and Facebook updates, along with links to profile pages. You can even Like, comment, retweet and @reply straight from the pane. Of course, it'll only do this if you enable Outlook to scan for public content on either service, something you can disable later.\n\nMicrosoft was kind enough to give me an early look at the new Outlook and try out its new look and features. I must say, I like it. I also admire Microsoft's moxie in throwing out both the Hotmail name and the existing business model. In a year filled with bold moves from the company, this doesn't rank as the biggest, but both decisions feel like the right move.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice after making the transition (by selecting \"Upgrade to Outlook\" in your Hotmail settings) is the new design. Hotmail, which evolved greatly over the last decade but retained the same overall look, has finally gotten an extreme makeover.\n\nClean Interface\n\nOutlook's austere blue-themed design will be recognizable to anyone who's seen Windows Phone or Windows 8, and it makes the whole experience feel much more calm (Hotmail has always been the \"noisiest\" of the three major email services). And you can switch the blue color for something more to your liking at anytime.\n\nTwo great features about the new look: 1) It keeps things clean by offering you just one action item when you have nothing selected: compose a new message. And, 2) The layout is relatively tight compared to Gmail, minimizing the amount of \"chrome,\" navigation items and white space on the top of the page. You're here to see email, so email is front and center, and it still retains Hotmail's folders (as opposed to Gmail's labels).\n\nOnce you get past the layout, though, it becomes pretty clear that the general business of sending and receiving is pretty much the same. This is still email, after all. However, while using the Outlook preview I found that messages don't quite come in as fast as on Hotmail. This could easily be because of the nature of the preview, but Microsoft might also have some optimizing to do after the transition.\n\nExpectedly, you can launch Windows Live Messenger to start a chat at any time, and Microsoft says Skype support will be available at launch (it wasn't during the preview period). With Skype integrated, you can start a Skype conversation with someone straight from an email. Once Microsoft completes its acquisition of Yammer, you'll probably see similar functionality with that service.\n\nLeaving Hotmail Behind\n\nHotmail was at times an albatross and a best-kept secret about Microsoft. After a long period of neglect, it improved greatly over the last few years, imitating the best features of its competitors while retaining features (like one-click rearranging) that keep fans of traditional email clients happy. As a result, Hotmail is still the web's largest web-based email service, with 350 million users, according to comScore.\n\nWith the transition to Outlook, those users are in for a shock, but when they see what Microsoft's got in store, I suspect many will see it as a pleasant surprise. Microsoft's mail service has never been this clean or usable -- or looked this similar to Gmail -- before. The lack of clutter is greatly appreciated, and you have to give Microsoft credit for removing things like the big \"SkyDrive\" icon up top (we're here for email, thanks).\n\nIt's in the differences, though, where Outlook shines. The social integration is an excellent idea -- after all, if I'm conversing with someone on email, what that person is sharing on social networks becomes more actionable than if I'm just seeing random things in a newsfeed. Suddenly realize in mid-sentence that it'd be better to talk to the person? Just use Skype.\n\nWith features like those, Microsoft's web email service is much improved, and I'd even say superior to Gmail in many ways. If users are to have any issues, it'll probably be with the Outlook name. The brand generates a lot of bad blood among users, and people inherently fear sweeping changes. At least in this case, things get better on the other side.\n\nThumbnail image courtesy of iStockphoto, PashaIgnatov"},"shares":{"twitter":3414,"pinterest":37,"facebook":2479,"linked_in":851,"google_plus":946,"stumble_upon":2106,"total":9833},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qPxPd6xnWLCwLhVpHWUSB_CGANk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fcb%2Fgoodbyehotm.8Te.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/olgC5tVuUOaqjsuvuHfHYAmbGTI=/1438x0/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fcb%2Fgoodbyehotm.8Te.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LbplYJEMp8tKbNByt1Z468UcAzo=/356x205/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fcb%2Fgoodbyehotm.8Te.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2QdFwz58U3dGnChQM4dYU7XoeTE=/712x410/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fcb%2Fgoodbyehotm.8Te.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/U6BJE3SiYeU7pnJfpAQqzIGCNfY=/280x157/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fcb%2Fgoodbyehotm.8Te.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tXHSFmRZQx6uC8pd0fKWDDlVhZg=/560x314/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fcb%2Fgoodbyehotm.8Te.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/Oj5Pnm","display_title":"Goodbye, Hotmail; Hello, Outlook.com [REVIEW]","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[{"data-id":6781,"class":"content-gallery"}]},"excerpt":"If you've been on the Internet for a long time, there's a good chance Hotmail was your first email address.

Ninety percent said that social media communication has increased (28%) or stayed the same (65%).  The same is true for text messaging: 28% said texting has increased for them in the past year, while 65% said they have been texting at the same level over the past year.\n\nThirty-seven percent of MarketTools' respondents said that they now spend half their day reading or replying to work email.  While we aren't surprised by that number, we were a bit stunned to learn that 55% believe spending time in work email increases their productivity.  These people said that they prefer email communication especially when they want to send messages to multiple people at once (74%), want to have a written record of a conversation (73%) or have detailed information such as a document (65%).\n\nAs part of the study, Microsoft also released a rather lengthy infographic depicting the evolution of email since its introduction in 1965 (yes, email is nearly 50 years old).  While the infographic is a little Microsoft and Outlook-heavy, it does provide a decent glimpse into the historical milestones of email, including the introduction of IBM Lotus Notes (1989), the introduction of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (1982) and even the release of You've Got Mail in box offices worldwide.\n\nHow have your email habits changed over the past decade?
