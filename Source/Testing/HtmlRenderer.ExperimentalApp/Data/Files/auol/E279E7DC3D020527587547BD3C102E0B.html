Their gift<br>                             overshadowed a $100 million gift to buttress primary school reading in<br>                             Mississippi, which was announced in January by James Barksdale, the former<br>                             president of Netscape. Indeed, it seems that scarcely a week goes by without some<br>                             major donor disclosing his (or her) intention to shower lots of money onto K-12<br>                             education in the hopes of making it better.<br><br>                             With all of these philanthropic dollars pouring into education, it’s time—indeed,<br>                             it’s past time—to ask what is known about how much good these dollars do.<br><br>                             The best-known model for large-scale private giving to foster education reform is<br>                             Walter Annenberg’s $500 million gift to U.S. public education, unveiled with<br>                             much hoopla and many accolades in December 1993. Ambassador Annenberg’s<br>                             gift combined remarkable personal generosity and civic-mindedness with brave,<br>                             ambitious words about improving American education. The biggest chunk of the<br>                             gift was used to fund challenge grants in the nation’s nine largest cities. These<br>                             Annenberg Challenge programs are to end with the current school year, 1999-<br>                             2000. Believing that the experiences of those cities could provide valuable lessons<br>                             for future attempts at school reform driven by private giving, we commissioned<br>                             case studies of three communities’ experiences with the Annenberg Challenge.<br><br>                             The authors of these reports take a clear-eyed, honest, and dispassionate look at<br>                             what happened in New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia. What they find is<br>                             that Walter Annenberg didn’t accomplish what he had hoped. While students in<br>                             some schools surely benefited from this unprecedented private generosity, the sys-<br>                             tem as a whole was largely unresponsive. Our conclusion is that the main reason<br>                             these grants didn’t accomplish more was because the essential idea on which they<br>                             were based—that what public schools most lack is expertise and that talented and<br>                             motivated outsiders working with the system can provide this—is itself erroneous.<br><br>                             Three talented investigators looked at the Annenberg Challenge grants:<br><br>                             Raymond Domanico is senior education advisor to the Metro New York Industrial<br>                             Areas Foundation, a network of community organizers working to organize parents<br>                             for school improvement.
