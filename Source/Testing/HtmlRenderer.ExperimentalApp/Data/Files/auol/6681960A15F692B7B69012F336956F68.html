          Website: <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/">http://www.americanuniversity.eu</a></p>
        <p>The American University Of London was originally founded in 1984 as the American College of Science &amp; Technology. AUOL, the international distance learning centre, which was subsequently incorporated as an independent Online and Distance Learning University, has six Schools: <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/courses/business-and-it/">Business</a>, <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/courses/business-and-it/">IT</a>, <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/courses/school-of-law/">Law</a>, <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/courses/school-of-humanities/">Education &amp; Liberal Arts</a>, <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/courses/school-of-humanities/">Humanities</a>, and <a href="http://www.americanuniversity.eu/courses/school-of-english/">English</a>.</p>
        <p>AUOL is a private international institution; we are not a British University (nor are we in any way associated with the University of London) and we do not award British qualifications. The University is specialised in Distance Learning education (in other words an &ldquo;open&rdquo; university). As such AUOL has sought and obtained recognitionÂ from independent agencies specializing primarily in distance learning.</p>
        <p>The University&lsquo;s academic staff are highly qualified and experienced. They are accustomed to working with executives, managers and consultants employed in both the private and public sectors. The programs of AUOL are designed for those leading a busy and successful life who want recognition for past achievements and/or require a study program leading to that essential degree qualification.</p>
        <p>Surveys over the years have shown that a degree earned through a non-campus University with a strong reputation such as the American University of London, can be just as useful as one from a traditional school. A recent report by the UK Institute for Fiscal Studies found that, on average, men with first degrees earned around 15% more than male non-graduates with similar backgrounds and levels of ability.</p>
        <p>Here is your opportunity to improve your status and your employment prospects. We live in a competitive world. The following pages provide an introduction to AUOL.</p>
 <p>In order to facilitate the research and supervision of candidates for higher degrees, AUOL has contracted and accredited, on an adjunct basis, a number of professors, lecturers and specialists in various fields located in many countries all over the world. This makes for easier communication between student and supervisor.</p>
