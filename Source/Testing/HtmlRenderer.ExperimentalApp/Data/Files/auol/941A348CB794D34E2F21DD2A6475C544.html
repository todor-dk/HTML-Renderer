I can’t express how professional, diligent, encouraging and pleasant your staff was with me throughout the process, despite all obstacles placed in front of us, and the lack of professionalism and competence others dealt with displayed. Your team worked hard for a favorable loan rate, term length and renewal options.<br><br>
 
Your team assisted me with the brokers, my attorney, seller, seller’s counsel, lender, lender’s counsel, lessee, survey company, and title company over the course of a five month period. If they had not been involved, Hammar Inc. may not have been able to conclude this purchase.<br><br>
 
If not for Capstone Financial, either my family would not have this property or we would have paid much more in legal fees acquiring it. We are extremely grateful to be your client!"

There were several “challenges” associated with our UMB Bank property during the Escrow process, and having these guys on the deal made all the difference in getting it closed. Communication, response and availability are very important to me. Capstone exceeds in all three areas. You don’t find service like this very often which is why I plan working with them as many times as possible, especially with their problem-solving approach. Aside from the intangibles, their terms were also very competitive. I can recommend Capstone every time and look forward to the next deal."
