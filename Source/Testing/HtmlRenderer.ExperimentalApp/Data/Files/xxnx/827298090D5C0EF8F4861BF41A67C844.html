<h1>Unblock XNXX</h1>

<p class="narrow">Can't access <em>xnxx.com</em> because of Internet filtering in your organization or country? This page will introduce you to multiple block evasion methods, explain differences between them and their applicability in different situations.</p>
<p class="narrow">By the time you read to the end you'll know at least one (likely more) working method of accessing XNXX and most other sites from behind a blocker.</p>


<div class="clear"></div>
<form class="unblock-form">
  <!--<input type="text" value="xnxx.com"/>
      <br/>
      <button type="submit">Unblock</button>-->
</form>

<h2>Option 1: use our free unblocker</h2>
<p class="narrow">This one is the easiest by far. Click "unblock!" below and you'll be taken straight to xnxx.com via our unblocking proxy.</p>
<p class="narrow">The nice thing about this method is that you don't need to download anything or modify your computer settings. And thus you can use it even if you don't have Administrator privileges on the computer you are using to access the Internet.</p>
<form method="POST" action="/">
  <input type="hidden" name="url" value="xnxx.com"/>
  <input type='hidden' name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' value='vXRAdjgjowQPvksBG3GbxDTp6AINoliI' />
  <div class="unblock-teaser" onclick="this.parentElement.submit()">
    <p>
      UNBLOCK!
    </p>
    <input type="image" src="/media/thumbs/xnxx.com.jpg.360x240_q85_crop-0%2C0.jpg" style="width:360px; height:240px;"/>
  </div>
</form>
<p class="narrow">There would be no need for option #2 if it worked perfectly every time. But what if this proxy gets blocked?</p>

<h2>Option 2: use Google Translate</h2>
<p class="narrow">Not many people realize this, but Google Translate is actually a proxy. Just go to <a href="https://translate.google.com/" target="_blank">translate.google.com</a>, choose any language as source language and English as target, enter "http://xnxx.com/" into the filed and hit "Translate".</p>
<p class="narrow">The good thing is that most censors don't realize this either so Google Translate is almost always unblocked. The problem with it (and to a slightly lesser extent, option #1) however is that all web proxies inevitably break the functionality of some websites.</p>
<h2>Option 3: use public DNS servers</h2>
<p class="narrow">DNS is a part of the Internet infrastructure that lets requests from your computer find their way to XNXX (or any other site's) servers. Hijacking DNS requests is the most frequently used way to implement Internet filtering. By default most computers are configured to use ISP servers provided by ISP. However you can change this setting and use DNS servers operated by a neutral party and free of censorship.</p>
<p class="narrow">To see if you are subject of DNS-based filtering, do the following:</p>
<p class="narrow">If you are on Windows, open Start Menu -> Run, type "cmd" and hit Enter. On a Mac, run Terminal from Applications -> Utilities. A console window will open. Type "ping xnxx.com" and hit Enter.</p>
<pre>
  C:\Documents and Settings\User>ping xnxx.com

  Pinging xnxx.com [185.88.181.54] with 32 bytes of data</pre>
<p class="narrow">The number in square brackets ("185.88.181.54" in our example) is the IP address of xnxx.com server. If it's anything other than  <em>185.88.181.54</em>, <em>185.88.181.55</em>, <em>185.88.181.56</em>, <em>185.88.181.57</em>, <em>185.88.181.58</em>, <em>185.88.181.59</em>, <em>185.88.181.60</em>, <em>185.88.181.44</em>, <em>185.88.181.45</em>, <em>185.88.181.46</em>, <em>185.88.181.47</em>, <em>185.88.181.48</em>, <em>185.88.181.49</em>, <em>185.88.181.50</em>, <em>185.88.181.51</em>, <em>185.88.181.52</em>, <em>185.88.181.53</em> your DNS requests are being hijacked.</p>
<p class="narrow">If that is the case, you can likely defeat blocking by switching to <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using" target="_blank">Google's public DNS</a> (unless the filter you are behind uses multiple blocking methods at once).</p>
<p class="narrow">Please note that changing DNS settings requires administrative access to your computer.</p>
<h2>Option 4: set up an encrypted "tunnel"</h2>
<p class="narrow">The idea is to encrypt all your traffic and send it via a remote server (or multiple servers) making it opaque to your local network administrator, ISP and government and thus immune to filtering.</p>
<p class="narrow">There are several technologies you can use to achieve this, we'll address two most popular ones here.</p>
<p class="narrow"><strong>VPN</strong> (Virtual Private Network) emulates a LAN connection between your computer and a server and routes all the traffic via this connection. The advantage of VPN is that it guarantees that every program on your computer/device that talks to the Internet does so via an encrypted tunnel. It's also faster than the alternatives. The main downside is that a good VPN connection costs money. If you can afford it, take a look at the <a href="https://zenvpn.net/">VPN service</a> we recommend.</p>
<p class="narrow"><strong>Tor</strong> is a volunteer-ran anonymous network that (among other things) can be used to access the web around Internet filters. For more details check out  <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor project website</a>.
