</ul>

<p>My '92 240sx is having a problem with the speedometer. It doesn't always turn on when
the car does. If I wait about 3 minutes, it will turn on. Sometimes turning off the car
then turning it back on again will make the speedometer show. Does anyone know what is
causing this?<br>

<p>Well, I have never cracked the speedo open on my '90, but I have on other cars, and I
think all are pretty much the same. There is only a couple of places where it could be
&quot;slipping&quot;. 1) At the transmission - this is where the cable screws into the
side of the trany, there is usually a little gear here that turns with the trans, thus
turning the cable, which determins the registered speed. This could be missing teeth or
broken, or just a bad connection. 2) At the dash - the same cable screws into the back of
the speedo. There are little &quot;teeth&quot; on the ends of the cable that lock into a
slot at their respective conections. These could be damaged. Unless it is <br>
something in the speedo itself, I would bet it is a cable problem. Anyway, I don't claim
to be an expert, but I would start by checking out the cable connections, then go from
there.</p>

<p><em><strong>Re. 2</strong></em></p>

<p>Trevor, I am not sure how the trans is set up on a '92'. But I do know that on the 89
&amp; 90 a speedometer sensor is used, not a cable. I have a 89 and experienced the same
problem that you are describing, it was the speedo sensor. This sensor is located on the
side of the trans, basically right&nbsp; below the passenger seat. The sensor is @ $60
from NISSAN if I remember correctly and isn't very difficult to change yourself. Just make
sure you drain the transmission before you do so. Any questions give me a holler.<br>

<p><em><big><big><strong>Speed Sensor Check</strong></big></big></em><br>
<br>
The Speed Sensor is on the right hand side of the tranny just at the end where the drive
shaft comes in.<br>
<br>
To check it's operation, remove the sensor and measure the voltage (A.C.) across the 2-
terminals. Spin the pinion quickly and you should get approx. 0.5V A.C.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps,<br>
