					<p>Have you received a speeding ticket, and feel like your incorrect speedometer is to blame?</p>
					<div class="fright">
						<img src="images/speedometer.png" alt="Auto Repair Hickory, NC | Auto Master of Hickory"></div>

					<p>Did you know you can fight it?!</p>

					<p>Remember, it's not just the ticket and court costs...it's your insurance costs for the next 3 years!</p>

					<p>Traffic Courts often reduce a speeding  ticket based on a "improper equipment plea." With our MD Chassis Dyno, we can perform the most accurate speedometer calibration test around.  it measures to the tenth of a mile per hour.</p> 

					<p>We can test your speedometer calibration accuracy "while you wait" right here at our facility in Hickory, NC. Save hundreds of dollars in speeding ticket fines and insurance costs!</p>

					<p>Please note there is an additional fee to actually correct the inaccuracy if any is found.</p>

			<h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
			<!-- Manual Testimonials -->
			<p style="list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"Auto Master is my choice to service my vehicle since 2007.  I have always found the service quality to be excellent and the staff superb. There have never been any "surprises"  when I picked up my vehicle after servicing.  I have always been contacted before any additional service is performed.  I feel that I am treated like a member of their family. It is service I can count on for my vehicle."
			<br><br><strong>Judy Cain</strong></p>
			<p style="display: none;list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"I am a Real Estate broker and stay very busy.  I own several vehicles that I trust to Auto Master.  David and his crew are very knowledgeable and find any problem I bring to them.  I also from time to time buy and sell vehicles and bring to Auto Master for their opinion before purchase.  They have not ever steered me wrong.  It is a very good feeling that I have someone I can trust and someone as knowledgeable on any vehicle I bring.  Auto Master will continue to have my business for many years to come."
			<br><br><strong>Michael Eller</strong></p>
			<p style="display: none;list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"My family moved to Hickory about 2 years ago and we began using Auto Master for both our cars at that time. David, Alicia and their entire staff are reliable and  sincere business professionals and I would not trust our cars in the hands of anyone else in the area. If you are looking for an honest and well qualified group of auto service technicians, bring your vehicle(s) to Auto Master and you will be 110% satisfied with their work and the staff as we are. I have recommended Auto Master to all of my friends and co-workers and will continue to do so going forward."
			<br><br><strong>Barbara and Michael Silverman</strong></p> 
			
			<p style="display: none;list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"Hats off to the Auto Master Team. I was introduced to David and Alicia when my car was towed due to a blown engine. Since then, David and Alicia have become part of the family, with four drivers in the house of which three are late teens and early 20's, a car needs service once a month. They graciously take my phone calls and answer my questions almost weekly, as well. Thanks to the Auto Master team for great service and customer support."
			<br><br><strong>Ann Denzer Mt View Hickory, NC</strong></p> 
			
			<p style="display: none;list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"When I bought my Chevy Trail Blazer in 2010, the previous owner always took it to Auto Master. I had never dealt with them before, so thought I would try them as they knew the history on my SUV. I am glad that I stayed with them. Anytime I need service, or to check out anything, they always work me in quickly. David and Alicia are great to work with and always explain what they have done. I know that my car is in good hands always. thanks!!"
			<br><br><strong>Frances Brown</strong></p> 
			
			<p style="display: none;list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"David and Alicia at Auto Master are wonderful to work with! They have been servicing my autos since 2002. I have never had a complaint with anything. As a female I have always been treated with the up-most respect!"
			<br><br><strong>Pat Eller</strong></p> 
			
			<p style="display: none;list-style-type:none;" class="slide">"I have been a customer with Auto Master approx. 12 yrs. and I have always been very satisfied with the service I have gotten. They are professional and caring.  I would highly recommend them to anyone !!!"
			<br><br><strong>Revonda Leatherman</strong></p>
