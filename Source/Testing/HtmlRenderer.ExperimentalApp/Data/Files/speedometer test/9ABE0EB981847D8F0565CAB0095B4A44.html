     <p>If you have had transmission work done on your

     vehicle or if you have changed the tire size or differential gear ratio

     your speedometer and odometer readings may be incorrect. We can help

     you correct your speedometer and odometer readings on most pre 1990 

     vehicles.</p>

     <p>Just send us your calibration test results and we can build you a 

     custom ratio adapter to correct your speed readings. AAA Auto Club and 

     other similar dyno testing facilities can perform these tests on your 

     vehicle. Or you can drive your vehicle on a marked highway for 10 miles

     and record the mileage that your odometer recorded.</p>

     <p>Adapters can be built for GM and Dodge Trucks prior to 1988 and many

     GM and Chrysler vehicles prior to 1990. Adapters can also be used on

     Fords, Toyotas, Nissans and other vehicles, although installation may 

     not be as simple. Please call us or Email us for more information.</p>

     <p>Slimline drop angle ratio adapters now available! These adapters can be

     squeezed into tight spots and are perfect for your street rod.&nbsp; Call for details.
