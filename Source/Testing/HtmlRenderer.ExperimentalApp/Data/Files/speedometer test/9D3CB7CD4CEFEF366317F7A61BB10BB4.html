<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department has reclassified VASCAR as an electronic speed-timing (non-radar) device and approved its use by any police officer. <I>Commonwealth v. Smolow</I>, 527 A.2d 131 (Pa. Super. 1987). (Court cited 16 Pa.B. 3160 (August 23, 1986).)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local police were justified in using the VASCAR-plus device, since this and an earlier regulation consistently classified the device as electrical-mechanical, and the burden therefore was on appellant to provide expert or scientific evidence from which the trial court could determine whether the device was electronic or electrical. <I>Commonwealth v. Smolow</I>, 527 A.2d 131 (Pa. Super. 1987). (Court cited 15 Pa.B. 321 (January 26, 1985).)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the former PennDot regulation, 67 Pa. Code &#167;&nbsp;&nbsp;337.25, classifying ESP Machine (utilizes two sensors taped across street, connected to processing and display unit, to measure vehicle speed) as an electrical or mechanical device, rather than electronic device, was an interpretive rather than legislative regulation, the Court was not bound thereby, the court concluded that the ESP Machine was an electronic device which could not be used by local police. <I>Commonwealth v. DePasquale</I>, 501 A.2d 626 (Pa. 1985).

<A NAME="105.15."><H4><FONT SIZE=+1>&#167;&nbsp;105.15.&nbsp;</FONT>Calibration and testing procedure.</H4>

<P>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>General. </I>An electronic device shall be calibrated and tested as follows:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Power output. </I>Relative power output shall be measured in the following manner:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust dc power supply to 13.6 vdc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With equipment still connected as in Appendix A, Figure 2, position (1), position antenna system along each axis for maximum coupling. Simultaneously increase attenuation to avoid overloading the thermister amount.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust microwave variable attenuator for maximum attenuation and then calibrate microwave power meter.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduce attenuation until microwave power meter reads 0 dB.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculate power output taking into consideration the gain of the horn, and attenuation of the microwave variable attenuator, added algebraically with the power level indicated on the power meter.

<P>&nbsp;Example: &nbsp;Attenuator &nbsp;Power Meter Reading  &nbsp;Gain of Horn &nbsp;Relative Power &nbsp;33.6 dB &nbsp;&nbsp;0.0 dB &nbsp;33.6 dB -16.7 dB&nbsp;16.9 dB = 48.98 mW





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;<I>Transmitted frequency. </I>Transmitted frequency shall be measured in the following manner:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adjust variable dc power supply to 13.6 vdc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the equipment connected as in Appendix A, Figure 2, position (2) adjust the microwave variable attenuator for a stable readout on frequency counter.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Record transmitter frequency as indicated on the microwave frequency counter. Frequency shall be within .2&#037; of licensed frequency.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vary the applied voltage from 11 vdc to 14 vdc. Frequency shall remain within .2&#037; of licensed frequency.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Stability test. </I>The stability test shall be conducted in the following manner:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust variable dc power supply to 13.6 vdc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect equipment as in Appendix A, Figure 2, position (3).



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust square wave output of function generator to the switching level of the pin diode switch. While observing the frequency counter, adjust frequency of function generator to 1726 Hz (X-Band) or 3961 Hz (K-Band) or 5692 Hz (Ka-Band).



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vary applied dc voltage from 11 vdc to 14 vdc while observing indicated speed on device being tested. Indicated speed may not vary.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Relative sensitivity. </I>Relative sensitivity shall be measured in the following manner:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust variable dc power supply to 13.6 vdc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect equipment as in Appendix A, Figure 2, position (3).



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust range control if applicable on electronic device for maximum range.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust square wave output of function generator, to switching level of pin diode modulator. While observing frequency counter, adjust frequency of function generator so that device being tested indicates 55 mph.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly increase attenuation of microwave variable attenuator, until speed reading of 55 mph of device being tested becomes erratic.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Readjust position of device for maximum coupling.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat steps in subparagraphs (v) and (vi) until no further increase is possible, without losing display. Maximum coupling is imperative.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculate relative sensitivity of device being tested, taking into consideration attenuation or gain of each component in the microwave path. The reflected signal passes through devices two times therefore values shall be multiplied by two. <BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;<I>Accuracy test. </I>The accuracy test shall be conducted in the following manner:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Adjust variable dc power supply to 13.6 vdc.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect equipment as in Appendix A, Figure 2, position (3).



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust square wave output of function generator, to switching level of pin diode modulator. While observing frequency counter, adjust function generator for an indicated speed of 55 mph.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adjust microwave variable attenuator and range control for stable display.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While observing the frequency counter, adjust the function generator to each test frequency. Note and record the speed indicated on the electronic device display. Each test frequency shall produce the correct speed in mph within the limits of +0, -1 mph.

<A NAME="105.95."><H4><FONT SIZE=+1>&#167;&nbsp;105.95.&nbsp;</FONT>Manner of calibration and testing.</B></H4>

<P>&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Method</I>. An electronic device governed by this subchapter shall be calibrated and tested as follows:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish a measured 1/4-mile course with a tape, preferably on a relatively flat and straight roadway.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Run through this 1/4 mile with both the time and distance switch on at the beginning and the turn switch off at the end. Push the distance recall button. Distance will be displayed to the nearest ten thousandths of a mile&#151;that is, .2500. If calibration is correct, reading should be within + or - 1&#037;, or + or - .0025 mile.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;If calibration is out, recalibrate according to the instructions of the manufacturer.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;A course other than a 1/4-mile course can be used, but not less than 1/10 mile.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Run through the measured course of 1/4 mile with both the time and distance switch on at the beginning and off at the end. Push the distance recall button and record the actual distance in the unit&#151;that is, .2504.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now an accurate fixed distance in the machine that is within the + or - 1&#037; tolerance. With the aid of a stopwatch, check the accuracy for the vehicular speed desired by turning the red time switch on the speed will be displayed. This can be compared with the calculated speed described in paragraph (7).



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;Average speed is distance divided by time. With the use of a handheld calculator, divide the distance by time and multiply by 3,600 to convert seconds into hours. Use the time recall button to get the time in seconds. Also use the actual course measured distance&#151;that is, .2500 miles&#151;in the calculations.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Example:</I>

<P>&nbsp;Do not touch the distance switch after running the 1/4 mile course. By pushing the recall button, it should indicate a distance of .2504. Enter a nominal 15 seconds with the time switch which is checked with the time recall. It actually will be 15.10 and a speed display of 59.7 mph. Now calculate the average speed using actual time and actual distance.<P><IMG ALIGN="TOP" SRC="../images/w105-95.gif" BORDER="NONE" HSPACE="5" ALT="Web Only Graphic">

<P>&nbsp;This compares very favorably with the speed reading of the unit 59.7 (.17&#037;). This procedure should be used for other speeds by varying the time input to the unit.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)&nbsp;&nbsp;High speed running checks may be made checking against the calibrated speedometer of the vehicle. To do this, drive the vehicle at a specific speed. Turn both time and distance switches on. Wait 5 seconds and turn both switches off. The speed will be displayed.

<P>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Maintenance work-order</I>. A maintenance work-order containing the following information shall be completed and accompany the electronic device:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The serial number of the device.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;The work performed and the date of the work.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;The original complaint.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual work performed.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of time taken in repair of the unit.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;The stock numbers of the equipment replaced.

<P>&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Calibration forms</I>. Certificates of accuracy, provided by the Department, shall be filed for electronic devices calibrated and tested as follows:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;The original and a duplicate shall accompany the electronic device.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;One duplicate copy shall be retained by the maintenance and calibration station for at least 2 years.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;A duplicate copy, executed and signed in the same manner as the original, has the same force and effect as the original.

<P>&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Testing forms</I>. Technical data forms, provided by the Department, shall be filed for electronic devices tested as follows:





<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;One original shall accompany the electronic device.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Two duplicate copies shall be retained by the maintenance and calibration station for at least 2 years.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;A duplicate copy, executed and signed in the same manner as the original, has the same force and effect as the original.

<P>&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Equipment, timing strips and other devices</I>. The calibration and testing of equipment, timing strips and other devices actually used with a particular electronic device&#151;nonradar&#151;shall be performed under the specifications provided by the manufacturer of an approved device using equipment specified by the manufacturer or equivalent substitute equipment.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trial court did not err in admitting into evidence a VASCAR-PLUS unit speed-reading taken over a distance of less than the distance specified for calibration by the Department of Transportation because the legislature did not intend to establish a minimum distance requirement for the use of VASCAR PLUS unit, instead the legislature intended to establish a method to calibrate and test an electronic unit. <I>Commonwealth v.
