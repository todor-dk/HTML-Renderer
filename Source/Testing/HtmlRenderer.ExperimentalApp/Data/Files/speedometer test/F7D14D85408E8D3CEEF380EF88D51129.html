      <h2>FAQ</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>What is the MYSPEEDMETER measuring?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>The MYSPEEDMETER measures the speed (called throughput) that data is transferred between your computer and our network location. Your download speed measures the rate that information is transferred from the Internet to your computer. Your upload speed measures the rate that information is transferred from your computer to the Internet.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>How does this test calculate my throughput?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>Your computer connects through the service platforms of your High Speed Internet service provider, through the public Internet, to our test servers on our service network. This test directs your computer to download various types and sizes of files from our test server, and then to send them back up to our server. The time it takes to download and upload these files is recorded and a throughput speed is calculated from the times (the test files are deleted after the test is complete to conserve your disk space). The throughput so measured is the end-to-end performance between your computer and our network servers, instead of just that of your High Speed Internet service.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Why are my speeds so slow?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>Here are some quick ways to fix problems that may be slowing down your connection:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Getting a clean test; stop any ongoing downloads such as peer-to-peer software.</li>
                <li>Simplify the picture; try using a wired Ethernet connection to eliminate the possibility of wireless interference.</li>
                <li>Restart you modem and router can also help to clear connection problems</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The test result may vary with different operating systems, web browsers, computer system configurations, broadband router models, types of connection (wired or wireless) and other network conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What are the requirements to use MYSPEEDMETER?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>All you need is a modern web browser with Adobe Flash installed. It runs completely within your browser on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.</p>
              <p>Testing the throughput of high speed broadband connections of above 500Mbps requires powerful computers. CPU of at least Intel CORE i5 running at above 2.5Ghz, 6M RAM memory or above, and super fast disk drive of either SATA3 at 7200rpm or Solid State Disk are required.</p>
            </div>

          <li>
            <h3>How does this test calculate my throughput?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>Your computer connects through the service platforms of your High Speed Internet service provider, through the public Internet, to our test servers on our service network. This test directs your computer to download various types and sizes of files from our test server, and then to send them back up to our server.

          <li>
            <h3>I seem to get different results each time I run the MYSPEEDMETER test. Why does throughput vary on the Internet?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>The actual speed achieved will depend on several factors. The throughput of your High Speed Internet service is affected by a number of factors, including the distance between your computer and the broadband service platform (e.g. distance from the wireless / mobile base station, if you are on a Wi-Fi/ Mobile broadband connection), the network distance from our network location to your computer, the performance of network servers and routers, the condition of all lines between these two points, environmental factors, and your computer performance. Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that you will achieve the maximum speed, as many of the above factors are external and dynamic.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Why am I getting different speeds between my computer and my phone/tablet?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>The algorithm used on the MYSPEEDMETER website and the market ‘Speed test’ app on smartphones are very similar, speed difference is probably due the following outside factors:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Available Bandwidth:</strong> Ensure the tests don't overlap each other, as each test requires to have entire bandwidth to itself. Additionally, make sure no downloading actions at the same time.</li>
                <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> If you're both on a Wi-Fi connection, know that phones and tablets typically have less sophisticated Wi-Fi antennae. Some smartphones can't reach the 5Ghz frequency and supporting fewer "spatial streams" than modern laptops. These differences may negatively impact your phone's Wi-Fi speed, especially in areas of high interference on the 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi frequency.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Why does the download test work, but not the upload test?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>This usually happens if anti-virus or firewall software on your computer is intercepting test traffic. Examples include Anti-virus and firewall protection software. You can try disabling the software before conducting a test. (Remember to enable it again afterwards.)</p>
              <p>If that doesn't solve the issue; try restarting the router and modem. They can sometimes have temporary issues that only show up when trying to upload data, and restarting them usually clears it up.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>The Throughput Test says my connection is fast. Why do Web pages seem to load slowly when I am surfing the Web?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>The amount of Internet traffic and the load on the servers you are accessing affect your throughput while on the Internet. Although you may have a high potential throughput speed, your actual download speed from a remote site may be slower due to Internet congestion, server or router speeds on the foreign network that host your web site, and other external factors.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
		  <li>
            <h3>What is the highest speed reading in Myspeedmeter?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>Current speedtest supports up to 1Gbps line speed.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
		  <li>
            <h3>Should I expect the same speed test results on IPv4 and IPv6?</h3>
            <div class="details">
              <p>The throughput of IPv4 and IPv6 on home router may vary; please contact hardware manufacturers for more information.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="uNeedKnowH3">Something you need to know! </h3>
        <div id="uNeedKnowBody" class="details">
          <p>Running the test more than once will give a more accurate picture of your testing speed.</p>
          <p>The Speed Test checks throughput between your computer and our network to the Internet. This test does not check data rate (the speed or capacity of the High Speed Internet connection from the Network Interface Device, such as modem, network wall plug and Optical Network Unit, at your home to the DSL Access Multiplexing, Optical Line Terminal or network switch in your ISP network). Only a trained technician using special equipment can test the data rate. Throughput is not necessarily an indication of data rate.</p>
          <p>High speed broadband Internet access has been widely offered by broadband Internet Service Providers around the world. However, the current speed checking software is not fully optimized for it, especially on the upstream traffic.</p>
          <p>This test will also check Latency which is the times in milliseconds for a small piece of data to be sent from your computer to the Internet and back. High latency represents a delay of data transmission</p>
          <p>Packet Loss occurs when one or more packet of data transmitted from your computer to our network but failed. Lots of dropped packets can result in highly noticeable performance issues or jitter with video streaming, VoIP, online game and video conferencing.</p>
          <p>The test will be run the best with latest version of Firefox browser. You may experience lower performance level with Windows Vista.</p>
