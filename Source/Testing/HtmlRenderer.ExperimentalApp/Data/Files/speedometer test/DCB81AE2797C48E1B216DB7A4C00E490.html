Grand Auto Dinamika last week, we manage to get a glimpse of how a Bentley looks and behave in the road, and frankly its an exhilarating experience, despite they only give us a total of two laps to try both of the Bentley Continental S V8 and Continental Speed W12.\nSo in this article, we want to share a little bit regarding the driving impression of one of the most luxurious Grand Tourer in the world looks like, as we tried two totally different car, we will discuss the V8 version on this article and the W12 on the next article, so enjoy the article.\nExterior\nReally should we explained it in detail? as this cars have a tonnes of details. Ok, to\u00a0start, lets look at the outer design, as the Continental GT S is the high performance version of the Continental GT, whereas it shown from its huge lower air dam at the front.\nThe rest of the design remains the same, as it fitted with a two twin round headlights, plus a headlight washer on the lower chrome section, similar as the one fitted in the Continental Flying Spur.\nMoving to the side, you could see why its called the &#8216;S&#8217; version, as it fitted with a huge alloy wheels, a contrasting red brakes caliper and fitted with the Pirelli P-Zero tyres as standard.\nThe side profile remains to be faithful to Bentley old heritage, as the side profile forming the distinctive Bentley &#8216;Powerline&#8217; design, seen at the bold lines above both of the tyres fender.\nAnother fine details also fitted at the upper side of the wheel arches, could you guest what shape taken for this air vent? yes, correct, its a flying &#8216;B&#8217; letter.\nAt the rear, four exhaust tips, a diffuser, and a bold chrome lines strengthen its overall aristocrat looks of the Continental GT.\nThe tail light fitted with a classic LED tail lamp, with chrome lists surrounding it, besides that, it try to maintained a clean and gentleman&#8217;s styling of the classic Bentley, as no excessive lines or overlapping panel found in this car.\nThe gap? very consistent as it could be, plus a well polished painting, and details, frankly I couldn&#8217;t find any flaws in terms of build quality in this car.\nInterior\nLets go to the interior, as what you see is only one of\u00a0millions trim and color combination that could be applied to a Bentley, as you could even show the Bentey craftsman at Crewe UK, yours girlfriend nail polish color, and asked them to create a painting and upholstery color similar or matching with those color, surely the can. As they even fitted a stone into the trim if you want to.\nSo how about the quality? a top notch quality indeed, as every leather feels nice to touch, every metals feels smooth and solid, every buttons are measured its tactile feedback to make it nice to touch, they even pay attention to more details on the metal works inside the interior, as seen from a metal cigarette lighter, and metal knob besides the AC vent to control the intensity of the AC.\nThe steering wheel feel solid and the leather stitching are almost flawless, the steering setting is electronic, while the buttons on it could control the audio, cruise control, and MID system, along with a pair of paddle shift behind the steering wheel.\nThe instrument display also shows every setting found in this car through its color LCD display, and with a speedometer displaying numbers up to 340 km\/h.\u00a0Just Fyi, if you turn off the car, the steering wheel will slides a slight way upwards to give you an easier access to exit the car, and will return to the memorized position you have set before, after you seats in the car.\nAt the center console, you could find an analog watch distinctive to Bentley, usually made by Brietling as one of the most famous luxury watch maker in the world. Below that is the entertainment center with 8 inches of color screen, 30 Gb of hard disk, Navigation, phone capabilities, and display the air suspension system in it, plus\u00a0a set of buttons under it, to control the temperature, heater, fan speed, etc.\nBelow that, you could find the transmission, and an electric parking brake button, if anyone wondering how to move the transmission into D or R? its simple, just press the big black colored &#8216;B&#8217; buttons above the transmission lever to move it.\nBehind the transmission, a start stop button (but you still have to enter the key manually at a slot besides the steering wheel to activate the car), hazard light buttons, seat heater, suspension setting button, and a button to raise or lower your car suspension whatever you like the setup would be.\nWhile the seats, as it covered with a luxurious upholstery, it also fitted with an electronic adjustment, covering almost everything you could think of for a seat and to get the best driving position, from the height, recline, slide, lumbar, lower thigh support, plus memory settings.\nHow about the rear? as it is a Gran Tourer, not much to talk about in terms of spaciousness, but one thing for sure, the level of luxuriousness and details fitted at the 2nd row seats are not in a different league, as a top level of craftsmanship also applied\u00a0throughout\u00a0the rear cabin.\nEngine\nLet&#8217;s talk the most interesting part of this car, the engine, as the Continental GT S V8 fitted with a powerful 4.0 liter V8 twin scroll turbocharger producing 521 bhp (528 PS) at 6,000 rpm, and a maximum torque of 680 nm, starting 1,700 rpm, Honestly\u00a0its basically a supercar figures.\nPaired with an 8-speed ZF transmission, the Bentley Continental GT S V8 could accelerate from 0-100 km\/h in just 4.5 seconds, and reaching a top speed of 308 km\/h. So someone was wondering why the acceleration figures is not as amazing as other sportscar? its because fitted with all those luxuriousness, and features, the Continental GT weights almost reaching 2.3 tonnes, which definitely\u00a0reduce its power to weight ratio.\nSo how about the performance? did it makes you scream in joy and pump\u00a0your adrenaline to your head, lets discussed it below, as this one thing really surprised us.\nPerformance and Driving Impression\nAs we were given to try the car in Sentul International Circuit, for just only 1 lap, we manage to feel the car ability in cornering, and exploring its potential, despite not its maximum potential, as we do love to get a chance to try the Sentul longest straight who are closed during this session.\nAfter given a brief inspection from the instructor who sits at the passenger seats, I change the suspension setting and engine response to sport, instantly the V8 roar sounds more deep, and fiercer, I did sprint the car from 0 km\/h in the pit stop, before the instructor told me to calm down and we will have a further chance to explore it further.\nFollowing the Jaguar F-Type as the pace car, who are driven by Fitra Eri, I tried\u00a0to maintain quite a distance with the car in front of me, as to explore the car potential, and after the Turn 2, I manage to get a huge distance with the car in front of me, and instantly pedal down the throttle to\u00a0expect a huge burst of G-Force hitting my spine, and surprise surprise as instead feeling a jolt that throw me to the seat, a\u00a0smooth acceleration a car could ever give make me stunned, as the instructor say to me that I have to be careful, as the car tricks you to make you feel not speeding, but in the reality, I&#8217;ve manage to hit a\u00a0speed of 160 km\/h before entering the Turn 3.\nWhen the time to cornering came, the car again surprised me, Ok it is no Subaru WRX STi who eats corner with an understeer but easily to counter, it also not the BMW M3 who agile and get in fast and get out fast in the corner, the Bentley\u00a0take the corners like a ship does, with a stable but controllable approach, I still\u00a0feel the abundant grip on the Bentley wheels, but in a more simple words, we could say that Bentley tackle the corner with grace and elegance.\nThe sound produce by the V8 engine also quite entertaining, as when you step on the pedal, a high deep tone of V-engines distinctive characters suddenly appears, and entertain your journey, while the brake, is one the most reassuring I ever felt, its not too over gripping like other sports car who want to stop you as fast it could be, its gradual, but when you needed, just apply more pressure to the brake pedal, and the car again, responds in a graceful ways.\nConclusion\nSo, what do I think of the new Bentley Continental GT V8? as despite its sportscar specification, let me remind you that this car is not a supercar or sportscar, this car meant to be enjoyed by a person who has achieved success in his life journey, and want to travel in a luxury ambiance, remains comfortable, but always have a\u00a0performance in his or her car\u00a0to be channeled if they need it.\nIt wouldn&#8217;t pump your adrenaline to the max, it wouldn&#8217;t throw you away if you hitting a kerb in a high speed, It will remain faithful with your inputs, its a gran tourer, its a Bentley.\nI did imagine driving this car, in a scenic routes in the world, like at the\u00a0Alps mountains, maybe grand canyon in the USA, or even Lombok narrow but twisty roads, with this car who possessed style, luxury ambiance, and performance more than enough for\u00a0the roads ahead, its really an ultimate Gentleman&#8217;s or I could say a Lady&#8217;s car indeed.\nStay tune only at AutonetMagz for a similar article discussing the W12 version of the Continental GT Speed!\n","copyrightYear":"2016","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"AutonetMagz","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/autonetmagz.net\/wp-content\/themes\/autodotnet\/dist\/images\/Autonetmagz_logo_for_web.png","width":312,"height":60}},"provider":"AutonetMagz","sourceOrganization":"AutonetMagz","copyrightHolder":"AutonetMagz","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/autonetmagz.net\/first-impression-and-test-drive-review-bentley-continental-gt-s-v8\/25165\/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Claudius"},"image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/autonetmagz.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Bentley-Continental-GT-S-V8-Driving.jpg","width":1152,"height":768}}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Organization","name":"AutonetMagz","logo":"https:\/\/autonetmagz.net\/wp-content\/themes\/autodotnet\/dist\/images\/Autonetmagz_logo_for_web.png","url":"https:\/\/autonetmagz.net","sameAs":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AutonetMagz\/","https:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AutonetmagzIndo","youtube.com\/autonetmagz","twitter.com\/autonetmagz","instagram.com\/autonetmagz","https:\/\/ask.fm\/AutonetMagz"]}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{ "@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [ { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "item": { "@id": "https://autonetmagz.net", "name": "Home" } }, { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "item": { "@id": "https://autonetmagz.net/first-impression-and-test-drive-review-bentley-continental-gt-s-v8/25165/", "name": "First Impression and Test Drive Review Bentley Continental GT S V8" } } ]}</script><meta property="og:type" content="article"/><meta property="og:title" content="First Impression and Test Drive Review Bentley Continental GT S V8"/><meta property="og:url" content="https://autonetmagz.net/first-impression-and-test-drive-review-bentley-continental-gt-s-v8/25165/"/><meta property="og:description" content="Bogor, AutonetMagz &#8211; From the media test drive held by PT.

So someone was wondering why the acceleration figures is not as amazing as other sportscar? its because fitted with all those luxuriousness, and features, the Continental GT weights almost reaching 2.3 tonnes, which definitely reduce its power to weight ratio.</p><p>So how about the performance? did it makes you scream in joy and pump your adrenaline to your head, lets discussed it below, as this one thing really surprised us.</p><p><strong>Performance and Driving Impression</strong></p><p>As we were given to try the car in Sentul International Circuit, for just only 1 lap, we manage to feel the car ability in cornering, and exploring its potential, despite not its maximum potential, as we do love to get a chance to try the Sentul longest straight who are closed during this session.</p><figure class="autonetmagz__image--content"><a href="http://autonetmagz.net/first-impression-and-test-drive-review-bentley-continental-gt-s-v8/25165/bentley-continental-gt-s-v8-running/"

alt="Bentley-Continental-GT-S-V8-Running" width="630" height="420" layout="responsive"></amp-img></a></figure><p>After given a brief inspection from the instructor who sits at the passenger seats, I change the suspension setting and engine response to sport, instantly the V8 roar sounds more deep, and fiercer, I did sprint the car from 0 km/h in the pit stop, before the instructor told me to calm down and we will have a further chance to explore it further.</p><figure class="autonetmagz__image--content"><a href="http://autonetmagz.net/first-impression-and-test-drive-review-bentley-continental-gt-s-v8/25165/bentley-continental-gt-s-v8-test-drive/" ><amp-img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25192"

layout="responsive"></amp-img></a></figure><p>Following the Jaguar F-Type as the pace car, who are driven by Fitra Eri, I tried to maintain quite a distance with the car in front of me, as to explore the car potential, and after the Turn 2, I manage to get a huge distance with the car in front of me, and instantly pedal down the throttle to expect a huge burst of G-Force hitting my spine, and surprise surprise as instead feeling a jolt that throw me to the seat, a smooth acceleration a car could ever give make me stunned, as the instructor say to me that I have to be careful, as the car tricks you to make you feel not speeding, but in the reality, I&#8217;ve manage to hit a speed of 160 km/h before entering the Turn 3.</p><figure class="autonetmagz__image--content"><a

layout="responsive"></amp-img></a></figure><p>When the time to cornering came, the car again surprised me, Ok it is no Subaru WRX STi who eats corner with an understeer but easily to counter, it also not the BMW M3 who agile and get in fast and get out fast in the corner, the Bentley take the corners like a ship does, with a stable but controllable approach, I still feel the abundant grip on the Bentley wheels, but in a more simple words, we could say that Bentley tackle the corner with grace and elegance.</p><figure class="autonetmagz__image--content"><a href="http://autonetmagz.net/first-impression-and-test-drive-review-bentley-continental-gt-s-v8/25165/bentley-continental-gt-s-v8-driving/" ><amp-img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-25175"

layout="responsive"></amp-img></a></figure><p>The sound produce by the V8 engine also quite entertaining, as when you step on the pedal, a high deep tone of V-engines distinctive characters suddenly appears, and entertain your journey, while the brake, is one the most reassuring I ever felt, its not too over gripping like other sports car who want to stop you as fast it could be, its gradual, but when you needed, just apply more pressure to the brake pedal, and the car again, responds in a graceful ways.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, what do I think of the new Bentley Continental GT V8? as despite its sportscar specification, let me remind you that this car is not a supercar or sportscar, this car meant to be enjoyed by a person who has achieved success in his life journey, and want to travel in a luxury ambiance, remains comfortable, but always have a performance in his or her car to be channeled if they need it.</p><p>It wouldn&#8217;t pump your adrenaline to the max, it wouldn&#8217;t throw you away if you hitting a kerb in a high speed, It will remain faithful with your inputs, its a gran tourer, its a Bentley.</p><figure class="autonetmagz__image--content"><a
