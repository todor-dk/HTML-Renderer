<H1>Speedometer Calibration Program - Method #1 - By Bowling</H1>
This program provides the necessary information needed in order to determine
what transmission speedometer gear is needed in order to properly
calibrate a speedometer.  This method is purely calculations-based, and
will yield very accurate results.
<p>
One important piece of information which is required is the number of
revolutions it takes your speedometer to register one mile.  On most
modern cars, this may be found on the bottom (or elsewhere) of the
speedometer face, usually in very small numbers. Look for something
like 940, 960, 1000, or 1020, or something close.  This number is
the number of speedometer cable revolutions (or equivalent in the
case of electronic sender units) to increment the odometer one mile.
Most speedometers (modern ones) are 1000 revs/mile, and this is a good
starting number to use.
<p>
Another vital piece of info is the speedometer drive/driven gear ratios,
the gears inside of the transmission or transaxle.  The drive gear is
the one which is turned by engine power, usually mounted right on the
transmission output shaft.  The driven gear is the one which is "driven"
by the "drive" gear, and is connected to the speedometer cable or
electronic sender.  The numbers entered in the program are the integer number
of teeth - just count 'em up.
<p>
The program will compute the best driven gear given a particular drive gear,
or the best drive gear given the driven gear value.  Remember that there
are only set combinations available, which you can find out from
the parts store or dealer.  Also remember that gear tooth numbers are
integer values.
