<h1>How to get Effects on Snapchat?</h1>
<p>Snapchat is a world famous message application and a social networking app that tends to all the child-like needs and interests of the people around. Using Snapchat, a person can send a message to another by taking a snap, or a small video and captioning them. Snapchat was also probably the first mobile application that raised the craze for selfie pictures among all the people around the world. Snapchat is an extremely fun app that can make even the most boring message extremely entertaining and fun. Snapchat has various features that enable the person using the application to be very free and creative. These features are known as Snapchat effects. There are many Snapchat effects that are basically used with an intend to change the appearance of a person, just for fun or to explain the mood of the person. Snapchat effects change time and again, where new effects are introduced, leaving the old ones behind. Due to various reasons, Snapchat messages are not permanent and get deleted within minutes of them being sent to the receiver unless the recipient decides to save them.</p>
<p>Despite probably starting the selfie craze, Snapchat, unlike most polished selfie photos, makes a person look extremely silly and goofy. There days, there are so many selfie-taking photo applications online that can be downloaded on mobile phones to make a person look prettier or more handsome. These apps come with featured lightings, make up tools, color tools, and other such editing tools that makes a person look much better than real life. So very, unlike these apps, Snapchat makes a person look quite eccentric and child-like. Snapchat effects are so many and they all give a person an entirely different look.</p>
<h2>Snapchat Effects</h2>
<p>There are so many ways in which a person can add Snapchat effects to themselves and look funny. They can use Snapchat Lenses, Snapchat Filters, Snapchat Face-Swapping, Snapchat Stickers, Snapchat emojis, Snapchat bitmojis, Snapchat text, Snapchat drawing features, and so on. All these various Snapchat effects change the way a picture looks. Let us learn about them one by one.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Lenses</h3>
<p>Snapchat Lenses are face-effects that Snapchat puts by using their facial recognition system. The best way to go about Snapchat lenses is to understand the features offered. Certain lenses will require the person to make a comical or a serious or a funny face so that the lens can mold with the picture. The next best thing to do is understand the type of device that the person is making use of in order to use lenses. Some devices may not support lenses and hence, the person will have to update his or her Snapchat accordingly. Updating Snapchat otherwise also is very necessary so that the person will know all the new lenses out there in the market. The number one rule of lenses is to shift Snapchat to selfie mode. Only then can lenses work. The person has to then position his or her face in such a way that the face is captured entirely and nothing is missed from the screen. The person has to then press and hold the face so that the complete recognition occurs and then he or she can proceed to choose the lens of his or her choice for their face. Puking rainbows, vampire face, puppy face, and so on are some of the most popular Snapchat lenses. Some other famous face-effects are the Puppy Face Effect, the Angry Face Effect, the Pug Face Effect, the Alien Face Effect, the Tiger Lady Face Effect and so on.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Filters</h3>
<p>The main difference between Snapchat lenses and Snapchat filters is that the latter are added after the snap is taken, while lenses are added while the snap is being taken. Like for lenses, the first best thing to do is make sure that Snapchat is up to date for the filters to be used. Then the person can proceed to enable the filters using the directions given in the Snapchat settings. Then, enabling the location services for Snapchat is a must do next step. Then, the person should take the picture or the video he or she wants to add filters to on Snapchat. Then the person can start adding the filter he or she wants, depending on the snap. To add geo filters it is very important that the person enables the Snapchat location services. Snapchat Geo filters can be for the city, for the community or they can even be customized as per the person&#8217;s request. Custom made Snapchat geo filters are made by specialists of Snapchat for a rate. Any person can make an original geo filter for community or other social causes. A person can try color filter, data filter or can add more than one filter to a snap.</p>
<h3>Snapchat GeoFilters</h3>
<p>Snapchat Geo Filters are mostly based on the background and the location of where the picture and the video have been taken. They are used mostly in order to enhance the effects of the background by using these Snapchat Geo Filters. They are slightly more serious in nature when compared to other Snapchat effects since they are generally used for noble community or social causes or even for business purposes. Snapchat Geo Filters are made for communities where anyone can use Snapchat to make an original Snapchat Geo Filters for schools, colleges, universities, homes, events and so on. Snapchat Geo Filters for business people, also known as Snapchat Geo Filters On-Demand are generally custom made, where a business personnel can ask one of the Snapchat experts to create a personalized Snapchat Geo Filters for them and their business so that they can promote it using Snapchat. Snapchat Geo Filters On Demand come with a fee and are generally made by specialists of Snapchat, whereas Snapchat Geo Filters for Community can be made by anyone, as long as they do not use a logo or a brand name.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Face-Swap</h3>
<p>Now, Snapchat Face-Swap is not your average effect or feature. It can be tricky for beginners as it requires a lot of handling and hands in general. Snapchat Face-Swap is available on Snapchat lenses. So the first thing for a user to do is to activate lenses on Snapchat. Then he or she should select the Snapchat Face-Swap option and proceed to take the picture. The persons should be very careful about their faces appearing clearly on the screen. Generally, on Snapchat Face-Swap, two smiley faces appear on the screen, so the persons should be sure to fit their faces in each of the smileys accordingly. The carefully, the person should proceed to swap the faces using the lenses option that is available just below. A single person can swap faces as well.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Stickers</h3>
<p>For a person to add Snapchat stickers, emojis or bitmojis on Snapchat, he or she should select the same option on Snapchat. A person should use the sticker option when he or she is taking the picture. There are many stickers available on Snapchat that a person can make use of depending on the photograph or the video. The person has to select one of his or her choices and add it or place it on the screen (where they like). The same way the person can add Snapchat emojis as well. Snapchat also allows the person to make a sticker of his or her choice.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Text</h3>
<p>Snapchat allows a person to add a typed text to the picture or video. This effect is known as the Snapchat Typed Text. The person should select the photo or video he or she has already taken and then click on type text and start typing the message or content of their choice. Then he or she has to click on done for the same to conclude. If the person touches the &#8216;T&#8217; on the corner, then he or she can change the type of text as well. As in the design, the font and the color and so on. Snapchat also allows the person to move the text and place it where ever he or she wants it on the video or the picture. The same way Snapchat allows the person to rotate the picture and place it however he or she wants to place it.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Draw</h3>
<p>Snapchat also has something known as the Snapchat Drawing feature that allows a person to draw on the image or the video that he or she has taken using Snapchat. This can be done when the person touches the crayon icon available on the screen when he or she selects the Snapchat Drawing feature. The person can also change the color of the icon and draw whatever he or she wants in any color of his choice. Snapchat also allows a person to add features by using some of their older versions. These versions allow the user to change the background of the picture or video into black and white, or sepia or other such color effects.</p>
<h1 class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  _10M0Ygc4">Snapchat Lenses</h1>
<p class="column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2  _10M0Ygc4">Snapchat is one of the most popular social networking applications that has taken the world by a storm in the most recent years. It is mostly a mobile application like WhatsApp and a user can click photographs or videos and send then with small captions or messages to the other person. These messages, also known as snaps are generally self-destructive and they get erased after the receiver views them. Snapchat is extremely popular because of its filter options, lenses, and effects. A user with a Snapchat account can create his or her own library and store all their snaps and pics which are known as stories for 24 hours and collect them and send them to their friends and other followers.</p>
<p class="first-para">Snapchat Lenses are features that the app came up with in order to customize the snaps taken by a user. These lenses, which are actually effects, filters or stickers generally transform the face of the person who is taking the snap into the desired lens. Snapchat Lenses were created recently for users to check out. The most popular Snapchat lens is the one where a user pukes rainbows! Lenses distort appearances and make a person look goofier, scarier or funnier. Lenses have soon become one of the most used Snapchat features ever since it came into the world. Lenses can also be known as the special-effect features of Snapchat. Lenses can also be described as animated overlays over the images that the user takes that change the way the person or the thing looks. The different types of Snapchat Lenses are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="first-para">Under the Sea</li>
<li class="first-para">Angry Lightning</li>
<li class="first-para">Strange Yellow Person</li>
<li class="first-para">Glass Shattering</li>
<li class="first-para">Anime Eyes</li>
<li class="first-para">Drooling</li>
<li class="first-para">Angry Electric Face</li>
<li class="first-para">Machine Head Gear</li>
<li class="first-para">Puking Rainbows</li>
<li class="first-para">Crying</li>

<li class="first-para">Jaw Dropping with Heart Eyes</li>
<li class="first-para">Robot Person</li>
<li class="first-para">Bug Eyes</li>
</ul>
<p>And so much more!</p>
<h2>Snapchat World Lenses</h2>
<p>Snapchat is usually not everyone&#8217;s cup of tea. A person who is very social-media aware will also probably find using Snapchat tough the first few times. And mostly getting to know the methods of operating it will probably take a little while because Snapchat asks for a lot of hand moment and so on. Snapchat lenses are only visible when a person holds the face on the phone and then chooses one of the lenses he or she wants on his or her face. It&#8217;s can get a bit tricky for first-time users. Many a time, Snapchat itself will guide the user to strike a facial pose so that the lens being used works right. So while Lenses changed the user&#8217;s face in the world, Snapchat introduced World Lenses that changed the face of the world itself.</p>
<p>World Lenses are a new feature under Lenses that enabled the user to add an animation effect to the surroundings he or she is in. So whenever the user is taking a snap, he or she can simply create an image to change or add changes to the world around them. Snapchat Lenses is a free app and World Lenses is available on iOS and Android.</p>
<h1>Snapchat Effects</h1>
<p>Snapchat is that &#8216;must have&#8217; mobile application on everyone&#8217;s phone that can cater to the goofy needs of a person. Snapchat has become extremely famous because of its filters, lenses, effects and so on that have changed the face of the people (pun intended). Snapchat is also a great messaging application that allows people to simply take a picture or a small video and attach a small message, a photo caption or a doodle and send it to friends and followers. So, instead of being a bland simple text message, Snapchat makes the message looks colorful, exciting and creative since it has a video or an image attached. But recipients of the messages beware, the message will be deleted in a while.</p>
<p>Snapchat is the exact opposite of those selfie mobile apps that make the person look better with their special effects. Snapchat makes a person goofier, scarier, funnier, and sillier. It&#8217;s all in good sport and everyone with a good sense of humor or anyone who&#8217;s bored with life will find Snapchat absolutely amazing. Effects and Filters can be added to the user&#8217;s snaps once he or she settles for the lens of his or her choice. Snapchat has come up with a lot of effects in the years.</p>
<h2>Snapchat Face Effects</h2>
<p>The most popular Snapchat effects are probably the Snapchat Face Effects. These effects are funny and full of expressions. They help the user explain the mood he or she is it. So let&#8217;s find out what they are. Face effects on Snapchat are created with the help of Snapchat Lenses. These effects are not permanent since new lenses are introduced each and every time. Here are some of the popular face effects introduced by Snapchat.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Puppy Face Effect</li>
<li>The Angry Face Effect</li>
<li>The Pug Face Effect</li>
<li>The Alien Face Effect</li>
<li>The Tiger Lady Face Effect</li>
<li>The Black and While Lady with the Red Lipstick Face Effect</li>
<li>The Beard Guy Face Effect</li>
<li>Smaller Facial Features Face Effect</li>
<li>The Gaudy Makeup Face Effect</li>
<li>The Vampire Face Effect</li>
<li>The Truck Driver</li>
</ul>
<p>Snapchat effects depend solely on Snapchat lenses. They are available for Android and Apple products. Snapchat has also come up with something known as the Snapchat Face Swap which is a highly popular effect. This effects also makes use of the Snapchat lenses to swap faces or two objects and replace them with each other. But Snapchat Face swap is actually pretty hard to do if it is depending totally on the lenses because lenses rotate all the time and capturing a still image is highly difficult.</p>
<p>A user making use of Snapchat Face Swap must first make sure that their Snapchat is in its latest version, if not he or she needs to download the latest version. Then he or she should open the Snapchat Selfie mode and tap and hold the face steadily till the white mesh makes a presence. Then the user should carefully scroll through the options and find Face Swap and click on it for the magic to happen!</p>
<h1>Snapchat GeoFilters</h1>
<p>Snapchat is a special social media application that allows users to take pictures and small length videos and send them as messages to their friends with small messages, captions or doodles attached to the message. These messages are known as Snaps. So, in order to make the snaps of users even more special, Snapchat came up with something known as Snapchat Geofilters that are effects overlaid over the spans. They look and seem a lot like stickers but are generally built in and are just like any other effects or filters of Snapchat.</p>
<p>Snapchat Geofilters are totally based on the location of the user and appear based on when or where the photo or the video is taken. So a person from one location will probably view different filters when compared to another person who is at another location. When Snapchat Geofilters were initially introduced into the market they were only offered to a limited number of people since they were offered directly from the company. But that has made a progress as more people have access to Snapchat Geofilters today. Snapchat Geofilters can be self-made or custom made as well. There are something known as Community Snapchat Geofilters that can be created by a person interested for the purpose of a community online on the official Snapchat website and make it available for free for people to use. Custom made Snapchat Geofilters are, however, not for free and are either available for a day or a month.</p>
<h2>Snapchat Geofilters and Their Uses</h2>
<p>Snapchat Geofilters are more serious in nature when compared to other Snapchat features like lenses or effects or filters. Snapchat Geofilters are made use of businesspeople and the people from the corporate world for their business purposes in order to promote events or campaign them. They can be used by individual users in order to elevate the status of their business, be it a wedding business, birthday events, baby showers, catering, and so on.</p>
<p>A user can either design his or her own Snapchat Geofilters or simply order for one on demand and ask it to me a custom made. Snapchat team also helps users create their own Snapchat Geofilters or will create the Snapchat Geofilters for users entirely by themselves. These custom made Snapchat Geofilters are definitely not for free, though, they come with a price. Once the user is happy with the Snapchat Geofilters he or she can proceed to map it for their purpose.</p>
<h3>Snapchat Geofilters for Communities</h3>
<p>Many users, artists, designers usually gather together on Snapchat to create community Snapchat Geofilters for free in order to develop or make for a better community. These Geofilters can be for a University, a City, a Cultural event, a Landmark, a Public place and so on. These community Snapchat Geofilters should be original and the creator cannot make use of brand names or logos to create their Geofilter designs.</p>
