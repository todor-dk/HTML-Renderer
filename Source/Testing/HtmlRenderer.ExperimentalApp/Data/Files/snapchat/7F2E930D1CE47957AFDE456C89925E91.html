<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

      <div class="description padded"><p><b>Snapchat</b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as "Picaboo", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school). The application was relaunched two months later under the name Snapchat.</p>
<p>Snapchat evolved into a mix of private messaging and public content, including brand networks, publications, and live events such as sports and music. Nevertheless, according to survey studies conducted in March 2016, the personal oriented messaging was still being accessed by users more than the publicly offered content that was being presented. 71% of users surveyed said that they preferred the app for its chat, messaging, and imaging services, versus 5% who almost exclusively chose the various events, published features, and media content on a daily basis. 24% responded that they accessed all features equally. However, about three quarters of those surveyed were also familiar with the events, media brands, and celebrity content, having a favorable opinion of those areas.</p></div>

The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as \"Picaboo\", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school). The application was relaunched two months later under the name Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat evolved into a mix of private messaging and public content, including brand networks, publications, and live events such as sports and music. Nevertheless, according to survey studies conducted in March 2016, the personal oriented messaging was still being accessed by users more than the publicly offered content that was being presented. 71% of users surveyed said that they preferred the app for its chat, messaging, and imaging services, versus 5% who almost exclusively chose the various events, published features, and media content on a daily basis. 24% responded that they accessed all features equally. However, about three quarters of those surveyed were also familiar with the events, media brands, and celebrity content, having a favorable opinion of those areas.<\/p>","links":"","id":5737,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/snapchat\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5737"}

It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial capital and technology center is Tel Aviv and the proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized.<\/p>\n<p>On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine. This specified borders for new Arab and Jewish states and an area of Jerusalem which was to be administered by the UN under an international regime. The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel\", which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former British mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces. Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states, in the course of which it has occupied the West Bank, Sinai Peninsula (1956–57, 1967–82), part of Southern Lebanon (1982–2000), Gaza Strip (1967–2005; still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement) and the Golan Heights. It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Efforts to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been signed. Israel's occupation of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem is the world's longest military occupation in modern times.<\/p>\n<p>The population of Israel, as defined by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, was estimated in 2016 to be 8,541,000 people. It is the world's only Jewish-majority state, with 6,388,800 citizens, or 74.8%, being designated as Jewish. The country's second largest group of citizens are Arabs, numbering 1,775,400 people (including the Druze and most East Jerusalem Arabs). The great majority of Israeli Arabs are Sunni Muslims, including significant numbers of semi-settled Negev Bedouins; the rest are Christians and Druze. Other minorities include Arameans, Assyrians, Samaritans, Armenians, Circassians, Dom people, Maronites and Vietnamese. The Black Hebrew Israelites are subject to a slow process of deeper integration, but are still in their majority permanent residents rather than citizens. Israel also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia, including illegal migrants from Sudan, Eritrea and other Sub-Saharan Africans.<\/p>\n<p>In its Basic Laws, Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system, proportional representation and universal suffrage. The prime minister is head of government and the Knesset is the legislature. Israel is a developed country and an OECD member, with the 35th-largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic product as of 2015. The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with the one of the highest percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. The country has the highest standard of living in the Middle East and the third highest in Asia, and has one of the highest life expectancies in the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":61,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/israel\/","latitude":31.389299,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=61"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/gadgets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T18:15:44.596556","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:55:58.578182","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gadgets","created_on":"2013-08-28T15:10:28.437418","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSS","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing","name":"gadgets","image_height":827,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2368,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg\/512px-Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Mobile computing<\/b> is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video.

From a commercial and economic point of view, both types of transactions generally result in the consolidation of assets and liabilities under one entity, and the distinction between a \"merger\" and an \"acquisition\" is less clear. A transaction legally structured as a merger may have the effect of placing one party's business under the indirect ownership of the other party's shareholders, while a transaction legally structured as an acquisition may give each party's shareholders partial ownership and control of the combined enterprise. A deal may be euphemistically called a \"<b>merger of equals<\/b>\" if both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies, while when the deal is unfriendly (that is, when the management of the target company opposes the deal) it may be regarded as an \"acquisition\".<\/p>","links":"","id":43413,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/mergers-acquisitions\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43413"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/snapchat\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T11:41:16.113339","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:39:56.891113","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"snapchat","created_on":"2013-03-19T16:39:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Beh","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5737","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat","name":"Snapchat","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":100,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c0\/Snapchat_Code.jpg\/512px-Snapchat_Code.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5737\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Snapchat<\/b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc.

The company is best known for the products of its film studio, Walt Disney Studios, which is today one of the largest and best-known studios in American cinema. Disney's other three main divisions are Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Disney Media Networks, and Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast television network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, A+E Networks, and Freeform; publishing, merchandising, music, and theatre divisions; and owns and licenses 14 theme parks around the world.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","links":"","id":75,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"tech","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","name":"tech","image_height":612,"recent_count":2,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13501,"daily_count":3,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":37,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Technology<\/b> (\"science of craft\", from Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">τέχνη<\/span>, <i>techne<\/i>, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">-λογία<\/span>, <i>-logia<\/i>) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.

This type of carpooling generally makes use of three recent technological advances:<\/p>\n<ul><li>GPS navigation devices to determine a driver's route and arrange the shared ride<\/li>\n<li>Smartphones for a traveler to request a ride from wherever they happen to be<\/li>\n<li>Social networks to establish trust and accountability between drivers and passengers<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>These elements are coordinated through a network service, which can instantaneously handle the driver payments and match rides using an optimization algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>Like carpooling, real-time ridesharing is promoted as a way to better utilize the empty seats in most passenger cars, thus lowering fuel usage and transport costs. It can serve areas not covered by a public transit system and act as a transit feeder service. Ridesharing is also capable of serving one-time trips, not only recurrent commute trips or scheduled trips.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 2010s, several transportation network companies were introduced that were advertised as ridesharing, but in fact dispatched commercial operators similar to a taxi service. The first such service to appear on the market was the San Francisco based company Sidecar (launched in 2011). Transportation experts have called these services \"ridesourcing\" to clarify that drivers do not share a destination with their passengers; the app simply outsources rides to commercial drivers.<\/p>\n<p>\"Ridesharing\" has been controversial, variously criticized as lacking adequate regulation, insurance, licensure, and training. One of the main so-called ridesharing (but actually ridesourcing) firms, Uber, has been banned in major cities such as Frankfurt, Barcelona, Vancouver, Buffalo and a number of other cities around the world. Opposition may also come from taxi companies and public transit operators, because they are seen as alternatives.<\/p>","links":"","id":302723,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ridesharing-taxis\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=302723"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/snapchat\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T11:41:16.113339","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:39:56.891113","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"snapchat","created_on":"2013-03-19T16:39:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Beh","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5737","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat","name":"Snapchat","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":100,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c0\/Snapchat_Code.jpg\/512px-Snapchat_Code.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5737\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Snapchat<\/b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as \"Picaboo\", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school). The application was relaunched two months later under the name Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat evolved into a mix of private messaging and public content, including brand networks, publications, and live events such as sports and music. Nevertheless, according to survey studies conducted in March 2016, the personal oriented messaging was still being accessed by users more than the publicly offered content that was being presented. 71% of users surveyed said that they preferred the app for its chat, messaging, and imaging services, versus 5% who almost exclusively chose the various events, published features, and media content on a daily basis. 24% responded that they accessed all features equally. However, about three quarters of those surveyed were also familiar with the events, media brands, and celebrity content, having a favorable opinion of those areas.<\/p>","links":"","id":5737,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/snapchat\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5737"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/uber\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T13:13:02.751054","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uber_(company)\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:44:39.005804","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"uber","created_on":"2013-07-15T16:56:20.083710","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":255,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Kpm","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=41020","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uber_(company)","name":"Uber","image_height":339,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":428,"daily_count":1,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":253,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/3e\/Travis_Kalanick_LeWeb.jpg\/512px-Travis_Kalanick_LeWeb.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/41020\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Uber Technologies Inc.<\/b> is an American worldwide online transportation network company headquartered in San Francisco, California.

The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.<\/p>\n<p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts. Facebook deems users from the ages of 13 to 18 as being a minor and therefore, sets their profiles to share its content with friends only.<\/p>","links":"","id":1066,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/facebook\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1066"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/gadgets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T18:15:44.596556","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:55:58.578182","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gadgets","created_on":"2013-08-28T15:10:28.437418","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSS","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing","name":"gadgets","image_height":827,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2368,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg\/512px-Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Mobile computing<\/b> is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term <i>New York minute<\/i>. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed <i>New York<\/i> after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the world's \"heart\" and its \"Crossroads\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 469 stations in operation. Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":134,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","latitude":40.71455,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=134"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/gadgets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T18:15:44.596556","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:55:58.578182","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gadgets","created_on":"2013-08-28T15:10:28.437418","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSS","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing","name":"gadgets","image_height":827,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2368,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg\/512px-Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Mobile computing<\/b> is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video.

Originally, a distinctive feature was that it confined photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid SX-70 images, in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras. In August 2015, version 7.5 was released, allowing users to upload media captured in any aspect ratio. Users can also apply digital filters to their images. Videos on Instagram debuted with a 640x640 fixed resolution and maximum 15-second limit in June 2013; resolutions now include up to 1080p since July 2015 and length is now up to 60 seconds since January 2016.

The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as \"Picaboo\", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school).

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term <i>New York minute<\/i>. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed <i>New York<\/i> after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the world's \"heart\" and its \"Crossroads\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 469 stations in operation. Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":134,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","latitude":40.71455,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=134"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/snapchat\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T11:41:16.113339","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:39:56.891113","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"snapchat","created_on":"2013-03-19T16:39:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Beh","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5737","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat","name":"Snapchat","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":100,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c0\/Snapchat_Code.jpg\/512px-Snapchat_Code.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5737\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Snapchat<\/b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc.

Through this process, a privately held company transforms into a public company. Initial public offerings are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital, possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors, and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. Although IPO offers many advantages, there are also significant disadvantages, chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors. The IPO process is colloquially known as <i>going public<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus. Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the value of shares (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale). Alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explored. In terms of size and public participation, the most notable example of this method is the Google IPO. China has recently emerged as a major IPO market, with several of the largest IPOs taking place in that country.<\/p>","links":"","id":58135,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/initial-public-offerings\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=58135"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/markets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T21:08:15.452180","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:54:53.160417","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"markets","created_on":"2013-08-28T00:33:24.320160","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":57,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LR0","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43390","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market","name":"markets","image_height":384,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":9739,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":57,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d7\/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg\/512px-Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43390\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p>A <b>stock market<\/b>, <b>equity market<\/b> or <b>share market<\/b> is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares); these may include <i>securities<\/i> listed on a stock exchange as well as those only traded privately.<\/p>","links":"","id":43390,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/markets\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43390"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:23:05.887814","twitter_username":"breakingmoney","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.049661","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"business","created_on":"2012-10-24T00:05:56","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":4,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business","name":"business","image_height":683,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":55977,"daily_count":5,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":4,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg\/512px-Downtownplazala.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over 10,000 feet (3,000 m).<\/p>\n<p>Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The city experienced rapid growth with the discovery of oil.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the focal point of the larger Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Greater Los Angeles Area region, which contain 13 million and over 18 million people, respectively, as of 2010, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world as well as the second-largest in the United States and the densest urban area in the United States. Los Angeles is the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the United States. The city's inhabitants are referred to as Angelenos.<\/p>\n<p>Nicknamed the \"City of Angels\", Los Angeles is a global city with a diverse economy in entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine and research. It has been ranked 6th in the Global Cities Index and 9th in the Global Economic Power Index. The city is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields, and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States. The Los Angeles combined statistical area (CSA) has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $831 billion (as of 2008), making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas.<\/p>\n<p>Los Angeles includes Hollywood and leads the world in the creation of television productions and recorded music; it is also one of the leaders in motion picture production.<\/p>\n<p>L.A. hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984 and is bidding to host the 2024 Summer Olympics and thus become the second city to have hosted the Games three times (after London). The Los Angeles area also hosted the 1994 FIFA men's soccer World Cup final match as well as the 1999 FIFA women's soccer World Cup final match; both games were held at the Rose Bowl in the nearby town of Pasadena. The men's event was watched on television by over 700 million people worldwide.<\/p>","links":"","id":477,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/los-angeles-ca-us\/","latitude":34.053501,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=477"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/gadgets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T18:15:44.596556","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:55:58.578182","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gadgets","created_on":"2013-08-28T15:10:28.437418","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSS","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing","name":"gadgets","image_height":827,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2368,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg\/512px-Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Mobile computing<\/b> is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video.

The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as \"Picaboo\", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school). The application was relaunched two months later under the name Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat evolved into a mix of private messaging and public content, including brand networks, publications, and live events such as sports and music. Nevertheless, according to survey studies conducted in March 2016, the personal oriented messaging was still being accessed by users more than the publicly offered content that was being presented. 71% of users surveyed said that they preferred the app for its chat, messaging, and imaging services, versus 5% who almost exclusively chose the various events, published features, and media content on a daily basis. 24% responded that they accessed all features equally. However, about three quarters of those surveyed were also familiar with the events, media brands, and celebrity content, having a favorable opinion of those areas.<\/p>","links":"","id":5737,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/snapchat\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5737"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"tech","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","name":"tech","image_height":612,"recent_count":2,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13501,"daily_count":3,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":37,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Technology<\/b> (\"science of craft\", from Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">τέχνη<\/span>, <i>techne<\/i>, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">-λογία<\/span>, <i>-logia<\/i>) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.

Through this process, a privately held company transforms into a public company. Initial public offerings are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital, possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors, and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. Although IPO offers many advantages, there are also significant disadvantages, chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors. The IPO process is colloquially known as <i>going public<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus. Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the value of shares (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale). Alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explored. In terms of size and public participation, the most notable example of this method is the Google IPO. China has recently emerged as a major IPO market, with several of the largest IPOs taking place in that country.<\/p>","links":"","id":58135,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/initial-public-offerings\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=58135"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/markets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T21:08:15.452180","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:54:53.160417","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"markets","created_on":"2013-08-28T00:33:24.320160","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":57,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LR0","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43390","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market","name":"markets","image_height":384,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":9739,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":57,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d7\/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg\/512px-Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43390\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p>A <b>stock market<\/b>, <b>equity market<\/b> or <b>share market<\/b> is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares); these may include <i>securities<\/i> listed on a stock exchange as well as those only traded privately.<\/p>","links":"","id":43390,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/markets\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43390"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/snapchat\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T11:41:16.113339","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:39:56.891113","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"snapchat","created_on":"2013-03-19T16:39:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Beh","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5737","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat","name":"Snapchat","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":100,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c0\/Snapchat_Code.jpg\/512px-Snapchat_Code.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5737\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Snapchat<\/b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc.

The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.<\/p>\n<p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts. Facebook deems users from the ages of 13 to 18 as being a minor and therefore, sets their profiles to share its content with friends only.<\/p>","links":"","id":1066,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/facebook\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1066"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/gadgets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T18:15:44.596556","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:55:58.578182","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gadgets","created_on":"2013-08-28T15:10:28.437418","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSS","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing","name":"gadgets","image_height":827,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2368,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg\/512px-Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Mobile computing<\/b> is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2fdmMob","longitude":null,"slug":"facebook-testing-way-to-live-broadcast","url_text":"Read more on qz.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/qz.com\/819242\/facebook-fb-is-testing-out-live-filters-like-snapchat\/","date":"2016-10-25T22:48:09.270198","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EIv6","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Oct 25, 2016, 10:48 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"qz.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-10-25T22:48:10.879059","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/987036\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on qz.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Jimmy","username":"jimmy.lovaas","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/22\/","full_name":"Jimmy Lovaas","email":"jimmy.lovaas@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Lovaas","id":22,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":987036,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/25\/facebook-testing-way-to-live-broadcast"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/07\/report-snapchat-hires-new-york-post-president","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Report: Snapchat hires New York post president David Brinker for role on content team - Variety","whoas":10,"content":"Report: Snapchat hires New York post president David Brinker for role on content team - Variety","url":"http:\/\/variety.com\/2016\/digital\/news\/snapchat-hires-new-york-post-president-david-brinker-for-role-on-content-team-exclusive-1201881779\/","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/snapchat\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T11:41:16.113339","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:39:56.891113","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"snapchat","created_on":"2013-03-19T16:39:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Beh","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5737","visible":true,"primary":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat","name":"Snapchat","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":100,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c0\/Snapchat_Code.jpg\/512px-Snapchat_Code.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5737\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Snapchat<\/b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc.

Through this process, a privately held company transforms into a public company. Initial public offerings are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital, possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors, and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. Although IPO offers many advantages, there are also significant disadvantages, chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors. The IPO process is colloquially known as <i>going public<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus. Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the value of shares (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale). Alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explored. In terms of size and public participation, the most notable example of this method is the Google IPO. China has recently emerged as a major IPO market, with several of the largest IPOs taking place in that country.<\/p>","links":"","id":58135,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/initial-public-offerings\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=58135"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/markets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T21:08:15.452180","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:54:53.160417","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"markets","created_on":"2013-08-28T00:33:24.320160","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":57,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LR0","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43390","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stock_market","name":"markets","image_height":384,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":9739,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":57,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d7\/Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg\/512px-Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43390\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p>A <b>stock market<\/b>, <b>equity market<\/b> or <b>share market<\/b> is the aggregation of buyers and sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of stocks (also called shares); these may include <i>securities<\/i> listed on a stock exchange as well as those only traded privately.<\/p>","links":"","id":43390,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/markets\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43390"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/snapchat\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T11:41:16.113339","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T17:39:56.891113","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"snapchat","created_on":"2013-03-19T16:39:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Beh","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5737","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snapchat","name":"Snapchat","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":100,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c0\/Snapchat_Code.jpg\/512px-Snapchat_Code.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5737\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Company","description":"<p><b>Snapchat<\/b> is an image messaging and multimedia mobile application created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as \"Picaboo\", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school). The application was relaunched two months later under the name Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat evolved into a mix of private messaging and public content, including brand networks, publications, and live events such as sports and music. Nevertheless, according to survey studies conducted in March 2016, the personal oriented messaging was still being accessed by users more than the publicly offered content that was being presented. 71% of users surveyed said that they preferred the app for its chat, messaging, and imaging services, versus 5% who almost exclusively chose the various events, published features, and media content on a daily basis. 24% responded that they accessed all features equally. However, about three quarters of those surveyed were also familiar with the events, media brands, and celebrity content, having a favorable opinion of those areas.<\/p>","links":"","id":5737,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/snapchat\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5737"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:23:05.887814","twitter_username":"breakingmoney","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.049661","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"business","created_on":"2012-10-24T00:05:56","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":4,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business","name":"business","image_height":683,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":55977,"daily_count":5,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":4,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg\/512px-Downtownplazala.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leaders debates that are sometimes held in democracies.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","links":"","id":2731,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2731"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"elections","created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":61,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=152","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election","name":"elections","image_height":341,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":15617,"daily_count":4,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/fc\/Election_MG_3455.JPG\/512px-Election_MG_3455.JPG","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"tech","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","name":"tech","image_height":612,"recent_count":2,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13501,"daily_count":3,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":37,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Technology<\/b> (\"science of craft\", from Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">τέχνη<\/span>, <i>techne<\/i>, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">-λογία<\/span>, <i>-logia<\/i>) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2cGsAUF","longitude":null,"slug":"photo-snapchat-filter-from-donald-trump-campaign","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/web\/status\/780528151344586752","date":"2016-09-26T22:07:11.930587","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EB3F","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 26, 2016, 10:07 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"Washington, DC","name":"Lauren Blanchard","screen_name":"LaurenBlanch12","tweet_id":"780528151344586752","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779431586626412544\/ZGUV9YK2_normal.jpg","user_id":"533061461","content":"Another Snapchat filter from the @realDonaldTrump campaign - Cartoon Trump parachuting out of Trump Force One to po… https:\/\/t.co\/YgxF1ztDkS","date":"2016-09-26T22:03:07","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LaurenBlanch12\/status\/780528151344586752","id":674267},"url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":false,"updated_date":"2016-09-26T22:07:12.339023","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/960571\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Rebecca","username":"rebecca.bratek","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Bratek","id":29,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":960571,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/26\/photo-snapchat-filter-from-donald-trump-campaign"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/24\/snapchat-to-release-1st-hardware-product","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Snapchat to release 1st hardware product, Spectales with built-in camera to record video clips through 115-degree-angle lens - Wall Street Journal","whoas":47,"content":"Snapchat to release 1st hardware product, Spectales with built-in camera to record video clips through 115-degree-angle lens - Wall Street Journal","url":"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/snapchat-releases-first-hardware-product-spectacles-1474682719?mod=e2tw","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/gadgets\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T18:15:44.596556","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:55:58.578182","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gadgets","created_on":"2013-08-28T15:10:28.437418","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSS","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mobile_computing","name":"gadgets","image_height":827,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2368,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/ad\/Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg\/512px-Galaxy_Nexus_smartphone.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Mobile computing<\/b> is human–computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage, which allows for transmission of data, voice and video.

Headquartered in Rockefeller Plaza's Comcast Building (formerly the GE Building) in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, the company is one of two successor companies to MCA Inc. (Music Corporation of America), the other being Vivendi through its subsidiary Universal Music Group.<\/p>\n<p>NBCUniversal is primarily involved in the media and entertainment industries; among its most significant divisions are NBC, one of the United States' \"Big Three\" television networks, and the major film studio Universal Studios. It has a significant presence in broadcasting through a portfolio of domestic and international properties, including terrestrial and pay television outlets. Via the Universal Parks &amp; Resorts division, the company is also the third-largest operator of amusement parks in the world.<\/p>\n<p>NBC Universal was formed on May 12, 2004 by the merger of General Electric's National Broadcasting Company with Vivendi's Vivendi Universal Entertainment. GE and US cable TV operator Comcast announced a buyout agreement for the company on December 3, 2009. Following regulatory approvals, the transaction completed on January 28, 2011. Comcast subsequently owned 51% of NBCUniversal while GE owned 49%. Comcast intended to buy out the rest of GE's stake over the following seven years, but nothing happened until February 12, 2013, when Comcast announced its intention to complete the purchase all at once and assume 100% ownership of the company by the end of March. The deal was finalized on March 19, 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Originally, the NBC Universal logo was a combination of the NBC peacock logo and the Universal Studios globe and text.

The prototype for Snapchat was started by Brown and Spiegel as a project for one of Spiegel's classes at Stanford, where Spiegel was a product design major. Beginning as \"Picaboo\", the idea was to create a selfie app (application) which allowed users to share images that were explicitly short-lived and self-deleting. The temporary nature of the pictures would therefore encourage frivolity and emphasize a more natural flow of interaction. When, in April 2011, Spiegel floated the product idea in front of his class as a final project, the classmates focused on the impermanent aspect of the potential product, and balked at the thought of temporary photos. Murphy was eventually brought into the project to write the source code for the application, and Picaboo first launched as an iOS-only app in July 2011 from Evan Spiegel's living room (who was still staying at home with his father when not away at school). The application was relaunched two months later under the name Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat evolved into a mix of private messaging and public content, including brand networks, publications, and live events such as sports and music. Nevertheless, according to survey studies conducted in March 2016, the personal oriented messaging was still being accessed by users more than the publicly offered content that was being presented. 71% of users surveyed said that they preferred the app for its chat, messaging, and imaging services, versus 5% who almost exclusively chose the various events, published features, and media content on a daily basis. 24% responded that they accessed all features equally. However, about three quarters of those surveyed were also familiar with the events, media brands, and celebrity content, having a favorable opinion of those areas.<\/p>","links":"","id":5737,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/snapchat\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5737"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:23:05.887814","twitter_username":"breakingmoney","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.049661","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"business","created_on":"2012-10-24T00:05:56","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":4,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business","name":"business","image_height":683,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":55977,"daily_count":5,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":4,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg\/512px-Downtownplazala.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.
