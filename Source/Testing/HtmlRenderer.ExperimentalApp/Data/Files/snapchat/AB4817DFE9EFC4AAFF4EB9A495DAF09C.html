Originally designed for quick photos â or snaps â with a limited viewing time, Snapchatâs features have become so popular that many users turn to the app as a photo creation tool for pictures they save permanently to their phones and share on other social media platforms, and recipients have the option of taking a screenshot of the photo.</p><p>Snapchat also lets users create a 24-hour story comprised of several snaps that followers can view an unlimited number of times before they expire.</p><p><a href="http://mediakix.com/2016/01/snapchat-statistics-2016-marketers-need-to-know/">Snapchat has experienced significant growth in recent months</a>, with a 350 percent increase in daily video views between May 2015 and January 2016. There are approximately 500 million Snapchat stories shared each day.</p><p>If you want these photos to feature your own distinctive geographic presence, you can make a bold impression on any local audience with our custom designed geofilters.</p></div><h3>What Are Geofilters?</h3><div><p>Geofilters are one type of filter, or overlay, that you can add to your photos and videos on Snapchat. Filters are built into the program and added with the swipe of a finger. Some filters are exclusive to a particular event or holiday, while others are standard options showing details like the current weather or the speed youâre traveling. Geofilters are those you can only add when youâre using the app in a specific location.</p><p>Filters can send a powerful visual message, and theyâre instantly personalized by the user whose photo accompanies them. Finding a special geofilter is an exciting perk for users who never know what they might have access to in a particular spot.</p></div><h3>How Do You Design a Geofilter?</h3><div>Snapchat makes on-demand geofilters available for a fee to any user with the design capabilities to produce and submit a standout filter. It takes a particular knack for creative marketing to create a filter that will really stand out and get a lot of use. Professional design services will help you create a filter that reflects the unique flavor of your event or locale. A well-designed filter can send a targeted message to users and viewers, whether youâre hyping a store opening, encouraging charity participation, or simply celebrating a private party.</div><h3>How Are Geofilters Mapped?</h3><div><p>Geofilters, by their very nature, are specific to a particular area. When you have a custom geofilter created, you must specify your targeted location. Snapchat users wonât see your filter as one of their options unless theyâre within range of your specified destination.</p><p>Once we have the coordinates for your geofilter, we can establish a geofence. This identifies the boundaries that users must be within to access your filter. At this time, on-demand geofilters are only available for a limited time before they expire. You must specify the dates and times that you want your geofilter to appear.</p></div><h3>What Is the Submission Process?</h3><div>Though Snapchat accepts on-demand geofilters from any user, <a href="https://geofilters.snapchat.com/submission-guidelines">these are subjected to a review process before publication</a>. Snapchat reserves the right to reject any filters that arenât appropriate or up to the standards of the application. With our professional design team on your side, you wonât have to worry about pushing your filter through the review process. Our professionals ensure that there are no problems with your filter, so itâs available for use at the designated time and place.</div><h3>How Are Geofilters Used?</h3><div>Snapchat users must enable location services to use geofilters. However, Snapchat doesnât store the userâs location. Users who arenât seeing any geofilters can check their location services under Settings in the Manage tab. Here, you can turn filters on or off. Within the app, you add geofilters to pictures and videos by swiping right.</div><h3>How Can Geofilters Work for Businesses?</h3><div><p>A custom geofilter helps you spread the word about your business beyond your physical boundaries. Though geofilters are only accessible to senders within your geofence, they can reach recipients anywhere. Snapchat is designed for communication, so anyone who uses your geofilter is spreading your message and generating buzz about your business. A well-designed geofilter will share new information about your business thatâs sure to draw in new customers as recipients see your intriguing design.</p><p>Since geofilters are confined to a particular time frame, theyâre ideal for sharing the news about a new product or special occasion. Contact our design team to create a tasteful and eye-catching filter for your induction ceremony, trade show, conference, awards ceremony, fundraiser, or other event.</p></div><h3>Whom Do You Reach with Geofilters?</h3><div><p>Geofilters are a powerful tool for businesses who want to expand their audience. Their innate shareability gives you the potential to reach a brand new audience. For example, millennials account for more than 70 percent of Snapchatâs users. Marketers spend 500 percent more to reach this demographic, yet professionally designed Snapchat filters offer an affordable way to connect with these users.</p><p>There are more than 100 million active Snapchatters every day. Twenty-three percent of users are 13 to 17 years old, 37 percent are between 18 and 24, and 26 percent are 25 to 34 years old. If youâre looking for a way insert your brand into the daily conversations of a young audience, Snapchat is the way to do it.</p></div><h3>How to Add a Geofilter to a Snap</h3><div><p>Geofilters give Snapchat users the opportunity to add a fun, location-specific overlay to snaps. With Location Services and Filters enabled, Snapchat geofilters show up in thousands of places all over the world, from small towns to big cities, wherever Snapchat users can be found.</p><p><strong>Turn Location Services On</strong></p><p>Itâs super easy to add a geofilter to your Snaps. Before you do, youâll first need to navigate to your Snapchat Settings and enable Filters and Location Services.</p><p><strong>iOS</strong></p><p>Navigate to Settings, then Privacy, and finally Location Services. Turn these on for Snapchat.</p><p><strong>Android</strong></p><p>Navigate to Settings, then location, and finally Turn on.</p><p><strong>Turn Filters On</strong></p><p>Once you have enabled both your location, go back to the Snapchat app and access your Settings by clicking the gear icon. Under Additional Services, click Manage. Simply toggle Filters to the on position. Press âOKâ when prompted to let Snapchat user your location.</p><p><strong>Swipe to Add Your Filter</strong></p><p>To add a Geofilter to your Snap, take a photo or video, then swipe left or right on the Snap preview screen until you have located the filter around you that you would like to use.
