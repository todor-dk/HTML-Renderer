<p>Snapchat, a multimedia mobile and an image messaging application developed by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy and Reggie Brown. The prototype of Snapchat was brought by the idea of disappearing images application by Brown and Spiegel, who had coding experience. The three together worked closely several months, through the beginning of the product release, until Murphy and Spiegel planned to deny Brown further access a few weeks prior relaunching the application as Snapchat. </p>

<p>The team targeted on the technical and usability aspects, rather than branding efforts and in September 2011, Snapchat, inc company was formed. </p>

<p>The growth of the app as on May 2012 was twenty five images were sent every per second and on Novemember 2012, the app gained more than one billion photos on the iOS app, with twenty million images being shared every day. In Novemember 2012, the issues with userbase scalability was cited by Spiegel as the reason why the app was undergoing some difficulties delivering its images called as “snaps” in real time. On October 29, 2012 an Android app was released. </p>

<p>In June 2013, Banquo, a Snapchat version 5.0 was launched for iOS. The updated version includes speed and design upgrade, including navigation, swipe, double tap to comment, an in - app profile and an improved friend finder. The reference name was named from Shakespeare’s Macbeth, a character in the play who is considered and seen to be victorious over evil. Also, Snapchat also released Snapkidz in June 2013 for kid under the age of 13. The app was the original Snapchat application and was activated by filling in the details like as the birth date to verify. Snapkidz allowed kids to take snaps and draw them, but they will not be able to send snaps to other users and can only save images locally on the device. </p>
