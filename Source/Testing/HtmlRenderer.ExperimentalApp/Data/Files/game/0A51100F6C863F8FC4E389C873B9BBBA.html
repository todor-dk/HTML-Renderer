                                GameUp is a vetted and always-expanding collection of cross-curricular digital learning games from leading game designers, paired with implementation materials. A Lesson Ideas page accompanies each game, with game guides; tips; tutorials; standards-aligned lesson plans, and assessment ideas. Select GameUp titles are enabled with our SnapThought tool, which encourages reflection in key moments in game play. Students can capture a screenshot of what they’ve done, make notes about it, and send it to teachers for feedback. GameUp targets upper elementary and middle school students, but we also offer GameUp for K-3 students on BrainPOP Jr., as well as a selection of games on BrainPOP ESL, our English language learning program.                            </p>
