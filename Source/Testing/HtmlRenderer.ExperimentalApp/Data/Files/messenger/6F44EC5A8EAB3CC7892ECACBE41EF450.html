<p>Good evening, Lord God! I meet him tomorrow, clothed in the sun, hidden in the embrace of a friend, delivered in the smile of a brother and fully revealed in the outstretched hands that one is willing to lift!</p>
<p>Sometimes I find myself wanting to miss someone, to write for someone, to say good night to someone, to feel homesick; But there is no one. That&#8217;s the price you pay for being alone. And honestly? Is low. It &#8216;s good to fly for this life that only has room for one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bem agora<br />
Se pouco a pouco você deixar de me amar<br />
Vou parar de te amar<br />
Pouco a pouco<br />
Se de repente você me esquecer<br />
Não olhe para mim<br />
Para já deve ter esquecido que você</p>
<p>Se você acha que é longa e louca o vento das bandeiras <strong><a href="http://mensagensparacelulargratis.blogspot.com/2013/11/frases-de-amor.html">frases curtas de amor</a></strong> que passa através da minha vida<br />
E você decidir me deixar na margem do coração, onde eu tenho raízes<br />
Lembrar<br />
Que naquele dia, naquela hora, eu levantarei meus braços<br />
E minhas raízes partirão para buscar outra terra &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O que é o amor? Eu conheci nas ruas um jovem muito pobre que estava apaixonado. O chapéu era velho, o casaco usado, a água passou por seus sapatos e as estrelas através de sua alma &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gravitação não é responsável pelas pessoas caindo no amor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nós perder tempo procurando o amante perfeito, em vez de criar o amor perfeito.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Não é possível amar e de parte. Você vai querer que era. Você pode transmutar amor, ignorá-la, atrapalhar, mas você nunca pode retirá-lo fora de você. Eu sei por experiência que os poetas têm razão: o amor é eterno &#8220;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eu caí no amor com sua coragem, sua sinceridade, <a href="http://mensagensparacelulargratis.blogspot.com/"><strong>Mensagens para celular</strong></a> e sua flamejante auto-respeito. E é estas coisas que eu acredito, mesmo que o mundo inteiro o espectáculo de suspeitas selvagens que ela não era tudo o que ela deveria ser. Eu a amo e isso é o começo de tudo. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bem-vindo ao maravilhoso mundo do ciúme, pensou. Para o preço de admissão, você tem uma dor de cabeça, uma vontade quase irresistível para cometer assassinato, e um complexo de inferioridade. Yippee &#8220;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eles dizem que quando você está sentindo falta de alguém que eles provavelmente estão sentindo o mesmo, mas eu não acho que é possível para que você sente falta de mim tanto quanto eu estou sentindo falta de você agora&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Se ela é incrível, ela não vai ser fácil. Se ela é fácil, ela não vai ser incrível. Se ela vale a pena, você não vai desistir. Se você desistir, você não é digno. &#8230; A verdade é que todo mundo vai feri-lo; você só tem que encontrar o que vale a pena sofrer. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A vida, ele percebeu, era muito parecida com uma canção. No princípio não é mistério, no final, não há confirmação, mas é no meio onde toda a emoção reside, para fazer a coisa toda vale a pena &#8220;.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IqZy9nm9GSU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Qualquer tolo pode ser feliz. É preciso um homem com o coração real para fazer a beleza fora do material que nos faz chorar &#8220;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tudo o que eu sempre quis foi chegar e tocar outro ser humano, não apenas com as mãos, mas com meu coração.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Temos de nos permitir ser amado pelas pessoas que realmente nos amam, as pessoas que realmente importam. Muita das vezes, estamos cegos pelos nossos próprios interesses de pessoas a nos amar, as pessoas que nem sequer importam, enquanto todo esse tempo nós desperdiçamos e as pessoas que fazem nos ama tem que ficar na calçada e ver-nos implorar nas ruas! É hora de pôr um fim a isso. É hora de nos deixar ser amado. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cuide do meu coração &#8211; eu deixei ele com você.&#8221;</p>

The ASCI Purple at Lawrence Livermore Lab was built to simulate and replace the live test WMD. The BlueGene / L focused on important scientific fields such as prediction of global climate change, and study of the interaction between atmospheric density and pollution.</p>
<h4>
Sierra and Summit, United States &#8211; US $ 325 million</h4>
<p>Built using IBM Power servers and accelerators Nvidia Tesla GPU, 2 supercomputer dubbed Sierra and Summit will be installed in 2017. The next Sierra system will have no problems running in more than 100 PFLOPS while Summit will have processing capabilities up to 300 PFLOPS.<br />
the purpose of Sierra at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the nation&#8217;s nuclear program. Meanwhile, Summit giving more experience of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory&#8217;s supercomputer Titan, directed to scientific applications around the world.</p>
<h4>
Tianhe-2, China &#8211; US $ 390 million</h4>
<p>Tianhe-2 is the current fastest supercomputer in the world, being able to perform 33,860 trillion calculations per second, and is used for simulation, analysis and the Chinese government security applications.</p>
<h4>
Earth Simulator, Japan &#8211; US $ 500 million</h4>
<p>The Earth Simulator was developed as a level parallel vector supercomputer system used to perform global climate models, and to assess the effects of global warming and problems in geophysics of the solid Earth.<br />
The Earth Simulator System has several features to help protect the computer against earthquakes, with rubber mounts in a seismic isolation system, and lightning, with a high voltage, shielded nest that hangs over the building.</p>
<h4>
Fujitsu K, Japan &#8211; US $ 1.2 billion</h4>
<p>The K computer, called the Japanese word &#8220;kei&#8221; is 10 quadrillion, is the fourth fastest supercomputer in the world, with a theoretical peak of 11 PFLOPS speed.<br />
