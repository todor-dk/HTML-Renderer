Don't worry -- Facebook Messenger has new tool to help make your feelings clear to anyone you're chatting with.\nNow, when you're on a video call with someone live, you'll see a new Reaction Filter. Tapping on one of the now-familiar Facebook reaction icons (love, laughter, surprise, sadness, or anger) it'll animate on the screen to better get your point across. For example, for love, red hearts will emerge from your face and float around your head. Likewise, tapping on laughter (AKA \"haha\") will bring forth the \"tears of joy\" everywhere. \nSEE ALSO: People really 'love' Facebook's Messenger reactions\nYep, you can now turn yourself into a Facebook reaction on Messenger. The update also includes reactions, filters, screenshots and more.\n\nThe update also adds Instagram-like filters to video calls, including the classics sepia and black and white.\n\nFinally, Messenger is also making it easier to share screenshots of video chat. A camera icon in the chat will take a picture of the video call:\n\nAfter taking a screenshot, users have the option of sharing it to their Messenger Day, which if you forgot is Messenger's own Snapchat stories clone, or pushing it out to other platforms. But with all the brought-to-life emoji action here on Messenger, why would you ever want to, fool?\n\nWATCH: Take your summer picnics to the next level with this portable grill"},"shares":{"facebook":126,"twitter":574,"google_plus":6,"linked_in":12,"pinterest":1,"total":719},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UFaUc4yYfJ6QNCtiXYVv4II6YDo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F518711%2F772886c3-c9b5-47de-aa4d-9c4b7b171e30.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BWN4pB4NfSxTGYauHd3euzFBqdc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49719%2F36d24812-b462-46d4-9f4f-491a83899b0e.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XnP9uECr82BU8PgQiIHfy2KhZaw=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49719%2F36d24812-b462-46d4-9f4f-491a83899b0e.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HMTDmgkfbvAUFlatEf2RlM9LJPg=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49719%2F36d24812-b462-46d4-9f4f-491a83899b0e.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HVFgSfze54rsqUCC6KEKymLqN7E=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49719%2F36d24812-b462-46d4-9f4f-491a83899b0e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-yuVmJhqacZrMnqQXvPOs-lQ06M=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49719%2F36d24812-b462-46d4-9f4f-491a83899b0e.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2te8BX9","display_title":"Messenger reaction filters show emotion when you don't feel like it","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"VgobGN10NY","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"YOU are the Reaction.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Messenger reaction filters show emotion when you don't feel like it"},{"_id":"594aa47ef11b2c2ac3000676","id":"2017/06/21/facebook-messenger-bots-social-good","title":"How Facebook Messenger bots are driving social change around the world","title_tag":null,"author":"Matt Petronzio","post_date":"2017-06-21T16:53:16+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 21 Jun 2017 16:53:16 +0000","formatted_date":"06/21/2017","formatted_shares":"2.3k","sort_key":"1DnMFI","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/21/facebook-messenger-bots-social-good/","content":{"plain":"You could say Facebook Messenger was once the social network's most loathed feature. In 2014, the company forced users to download a separate app if they wanted to send and receive messages on their phones, and as a result, Messenger rose to No. 1 in the App Store—but with a dismal one-star rating.\nFast forward three years, and you still need to download the app (sorry). But Messenger has evolved, updated with shiny new features, a discover tab, advanced functionality, and a streamlined desktop version. And while it isn't perfect, it has become something none of us expected: an actual force for social good around the globe.\nSEE ALSO: This adorable chatbot wants to talk about your mental health\nFacebook Messenger has emerged as an important platform for a bevy of developers, humanitarians, and activists to create bots focused on real impact, all leveraging artificial intelligence and Messenger's 1.2 billion-strong user base to tackle inequality and the world's most pressing problems.\n\"Any time there's a human impact factor ... our heart races a little bit faster here on the team.\"\nFacebook opened up the Messenger platform to developers last year, and since then more than 100,000 unique bots have been created. You can't help but notice the recent surge of social good among them—whether it's a bot helping new activists find local protests in the Trump era, connecting refugees with translators in real time, coaching women through salary negotiations, and even encouraging talks about mental health. \nIt's a trend Facebook itself has noticed, and that the company is encouraging. \n\"I think it's kind of obvious when you're at Facebook that any time there's a human impact factor... our heart races a little bit faster here on the team,\" said Anand Chandrasekaran, Facebook's global director of platform and product partnerships for Messenger.\n\"A lot of us are really committed to the purpose and mission that Facebook stands for, and any time that mission can be used to empower a change creator or an activist or a humanitarian or just someone who wants to do some good around their community,\" he said.\n\nThat's in line with many of the social media giant's recent efforts. Over the past year, Facebook's Social Good team has launched several community-focused products like fundraisers and the Community Help tool, and in February, CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a 6,000-word manifesto all about the company's mission to \"build global community.\"\nMessenger takes that even further. Everyday people can now take the technology and massive audience into their own hands, not just building communities, but actively helping vulnerable ones.\nThat's exactly what Atif Javed and his team of fellow MIT graduates are doing. Javed, an engineer and product manager based in Silicon Valley, is the cofounder of Tarjimly, a bot that connects refugees and immigrants with translators in real time. The goal is to break down language barriers, ultimately connecting refugees to doctors, aid workers, legal help, and other crucial services in Arabic, Farsi, and Pashto as they resettle in a new country.\nSince it launched four months ago, Tarjimly has brought on more than 2,200 translators and more than 15 partner organizations. It was even featured in a keynote at Facebook's F8 conference in April as an example of the power bots can hold. \n\nJaved said the aid workers Tarjimly has worked with all love the idea of being on Messenger. They like being able to send audio notes and pictures, and it's something both refugees and aid workers are used to. Many refugees have smartphones, already using SMS texting and apps like Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\"I think that's the big benefit of these platforms—it's where people already live,\" Javed said. \"It's where they're already spending so much of their time, that it makes sense for them to be able to use that service.\"\n\"I think that's the big benefit of these platforms—it's where people already live.\"\nHe and his cofounders had made bots for Facebook Messenger before and knew it would ease the process for people who wanted to register for the service, rather than forcing them to adopt a separate app.\n\"It's nice, because you can just add in users quickly and test them and get people to use it, as opposed to having to have a long lead cycle between iterations of different versions. You can just see what went wrong and then you can go quickly make a fix,\" he said.\nTarjimly isn't alone in taking on a huge issue like the global refugee crisis through Messenger. UNICEF's U-Report, an early example of a Messenger bot launched in August 2016, allows young people around the world to answer weekly questions on issues that affect them. UNICEF chose Messenger because it wanted to tap into the youth demographic in order to advocate for children's rights, noting that young people are more likely to engage on channels they're already using. \nThere's also DoNotPay, which was created by Stanford student and developer Joshua Browder. Originally meant to help people get out of parking tickets, the app expanded to help homeless and evicted people fight for housing, as well as offer free legal aid to refugees struggling with asylum applications in the U.S., Canada, and the UK. \nBrowder plans to launch a dozen new services in the future, to help low-income communities and other users with things like pensions, benefits, and bail.\n\nBut you don't need to be a big organization like UNICEF, or an engineer or developer like Javed and Browder, to come up with a social good bot idea on Messenger.\nYou might even work at an ad agency, like Kate Carter.\nCarter, who's a senior copywriter at R/GA, \"never would have thought in a million years\" that she'd be working in the tech space, making bots. She's now the brains behind the Ask for a Raise bot, which mimics British entrepreneur and former advertising exec Cindy Gallop to help women get the raises they deserve.\nAhead of Equal Pay Day earlier this year, Carter and her team found out that women were 25 percent less likely to get a raise than men. So they asked themselves, \"How can we equip women with all the information that they need to get a raise?\"\n\"We were really looking for an insight that we could attack head-on, and build a utility that actually created a way for women to change that insight almost immediately—to take action upon using it,\" Carter said.\n\nThe idea to create a Messenger bot didn't come to mind immediately. She first thought of showcasing Gallop—who had the give-no-fucks attitude the campaign needed—while she had Skype conversations with women. But Carter felt that idea didn't have enough impact. \n\"The question was, how do we scale her? And a chatbot just became the best way to do that, to scale her on a global level,\" she said.\n\"A chatbot just became the best way to do that—to scale her on a global level.\"\nSo she teamed up with Brad Jacobson, senior experience strategist at R/GA. Carter and Jacobson previously worked together to develop GoVoteBot, a chatbot that helped people with voter registration during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \nThe goal with Ask for a Raise was a bit different, however, because they wanted to scale one-to-one conversations using an authentic personality. Carter describes it as \"creating a conversation between two women that gives you both what you're looking for.\"\nAnd that's true, in a sense. Carter wrote a script for the bot, imitating Gallop's words (like how often the British mogul says \"bloody\" on Twitter) and paying close attention to punctuation (\"There's nothing more human than the way in which someone punctuates,\" Carter said).\nCarter and Jacobson continued iterating over time, looking at how people interacted with the bot and accounting for responses they weren't prepared for. They both agree that chatbots aren't just useful because they automate processes—they're perfect for personal moments. Bots remove an \"embarrassment factor\" that could otherwise impede social progress, like equal pay in the workplace.\n\"It's just you and this conversation interface, where you don't have to divulge salary numbers, when you know you can get smart data back privately,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThe role of third-party, do-it-yourself development platforms for Messenger is crucial. Jacobson and Carter used Reply.ai, an R/GA client, to build Ask for a Raise, while UNICEF used RapidPro for U-Report. There are other popular platforms on the market, like Chatfuel and Meya, which help people build bots quickly, letting them focus on the content, rather than get caught up in the coding. That's especially helpful when your bot's content is supposed to change the world.\n\"I would say like 75 percent of the work, for sure, is taken care of by Messenger.\"\n\"What we're finding is that there is a really healthy third-party bot developer ecosystem on top of Messenger,\" Chandrasekaran, of Facebook, said. \"And usually that's a great sign that developers are embracing the platform.\"\nJaved and his cofounders built Tarjimly on their own, but Messenger made it easier to make the bot work, and to make the product they wanted, instead of building all of the communication infrastructure from scratch.\n\"I would say like 75 percent of the work, for sure, is taken care of by Messenger,\" Javed said.\nIt also creates a direct pipeline for feedback. There's no need to wait for reviews or help requests, as many issues and bugs will reveal themselves in the chats. In terms of positive feedback, users are on Facebook already, sharing public screenshots of the bots and how they've helped them. One user of Ask for a Raise shared an anecdote with R/GA about how, after using this bot, she walked into her boss' office and got the raise she deserved.\n\nBut Messenger is by no means perfect. Javed, for example, wants better analytics, the ability to test bots first, and a much quicker approval process. He's also noticed some bugs with the messaging center. Meanwhile, as a designer, Jacobson wants more functionality and flexibility with Messenger buttons and in manipulating how a user can interact with a bot.\nThis kind of feedback is important for Chandrasekaran, who's been at Facebook for five releases of Messenger's developer platform.\n\"The developers that have been successful, which is true of the platform in general but particularly in social good and humanitarian good, is that they embrace that it's a living, breathing platform,\" he says. \"We listen very intently to what developers are telling us.\" \n\nPerfect or not, Messenger definitely gets developers into the space faster and with more visibility than if they were to, say, create an app instead. Some have even likened Messenger to an app killer.\n\"We initially brainstormed this on a custom thing [and thought], will we have control over it? Will it be good enough? What if people don't use Messenger and they don't want to download Messenger?\" Javed says about Tarjimly. \"But I was like, what are we going to do? Build our own app and go in the App Store with another million apps? It's not worth it.\"\n\"Not only understanding it, but pushing the boundaries of it, has been really interesting.\"\n\"App killer\" is debatable, but you could at least see Messenger as a bridge for bigger things. Javed, for one, wants to turn Tarjimly into a full business with social good in its DNA. He envisions it being \"the future of person-to-person translation,\" not just for refugees, but also for lawyers, journalists, or even if someone wants to travel to a different country. Messenger, then, could be the birthplace of countless companies with positive social impact at their core.\nIt goes for individuals, too. That's true for Carter, who says if you have an idea for a bot that can truly make a difference in people's lives, or really any Messenger bot at all, don't be afraid to start.\n\"Finding myself in this space and not only understanding it, but pushing the boundaries of it, has been really interesting,\" she says. \"It goes to show that anyone is capable of doing it. It's just, do you have the heart and the hard work to figure it out?\"\nWATCH: Facebook's Community Help tool in action"},"shares":{"twitter":1203,"linked_in":719,"facebook":399,"google_plus":15,"pinterest":5,"total":2341},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8UXKlld6HITHvK2UbnHad0a88BY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F510861%2F0f1230bb-e7d9-45e9-b812-f126a032b038.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SM-SvZUA3oJYO4FxwcmJP_mxuxE=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48927%2F013a7886-5453-4572-9176-24cb6be9f750.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/O0gFG4ylT7lkerDkq332trdh1Qs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48927%2F013a7886-5453-4572-9176-24cb6be9f750.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cX85p6clRtXH-i6kHkRi64JB0d8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48927%2F013a7886-5453-4572-9176-24cb6be9f750.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QTpDvMcjaVyMPViIMXmSD0exJhg=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48927%2F013a7886-5453-4572-9176-24cb6be9f750.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UP6eMDH2lTqAVwUz-X9Sn9sYtCM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48927%2F013a7886-5453-4572-9176-24cb6be9f750.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sU7xr6","display_title":"How Facebook Messenger bots are driving social change around the world","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"yrlEzYzoLa","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Facebook Messenger was once the social network's most loathed feature.

A little over a year since the launch of Facebook reactions, they're now on posts, messages, and even comments. \nSEE ALSO: Wow! Facebook comments now have Reactions, too\nThe reactions came to Messenger just a few months ago, and have already been sent over 2 billion times, the company announced on Wednesday. To put that into perspective, at last count, Facebook Messenger announced a staggering 1.2 billion users. Messenger also features the site's closest thing to a dislike button in the form of the 'no' reaction.\nTo mark the milestone, the company released some insights into how Messenger Reactions are used around the world. The 'love' reaction is the most popular on Messenger, while the 'no' one is the least popular. The positive reactions are all more popular than the negative reactions.\n\nHere are the most popular reactions by country in select countries:\n\nYoung millennials, defined as those ages 18-24, send reactions twice as frequently as older age groups and are also more likely to send a wider range of reaction. Facebook also found that on average more men send reactions whereas women send reactions more frequently.\nWhile the like button continues to remain a definitive symbol for Facebook, the company has already started weighing reactions more when deciding what to show on your News Feed.\nUPDATE: June 7, 2017, 1:17 p.m. EDT This story was updated with a correction from Facebook about the name of the 'no' reaction.\nWATCH: This cute wearable is like a fitness tracker for kids"},"shares":{"facebook":241,"twitter":244,"linked_in":25,"google_plus":12,"pinterest":2,"total":524},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H9fNdFmLy-h-I_xxojxcRdanyYk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F500032%2F4cf1b572-41d7-440c-a6e2-50a6d520d927.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dL8XlvlEM-fAEcSLVcaaav7CLjw=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47940%2Fbf5a358f-15a0-423d-9e35-b2b75b68f6c7.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-Op7bP7ESGjknAAkuB_f6YaShnU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47940%2Fbf5a358f-15a0-423d-9e35-b2b75b68f6c7.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gymPSg1v6oJDGN2fH47jtBbeS2w=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47940%2Fbf5a358f-15a0-423d-9e35-b2b75b68f6c7.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sq8bGXdIfX-RXYITdHrv5fIoaA0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47940%2Fbf5a358f-15a0-423d-9e35-b2b75b68f6c7.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/myFwU_AxHbdEnlw2ofwV7Eg9Svo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47940%2Fbf5a358f-15a0-423d-9e35-b2b75b68f6c7.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2s4owq5","display_title":"People really 'love' Facebook's Messenger reactions","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"kEoD57L0pb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Over two billion reactions have been sent on the platform in just a few months","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"People really 'love' Facebook's Messenger reactions"},{"_id":"59203fe7f11b2c320c000443","id":"2017/05/20/app-roundup-instagram-filters-medium-audio-stories-assistant","title":"This week in apps: Instagram face filters, Medium audio stories, Google Assistant on iOS and more","title_tag":null,"author":"Freia Lobo","post_date":"2017-05-20T13:08:54+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 20 May 2017 13:08:54 +0000","formatted_date":"05/20/2017","formatted_shares":"545","sort_key":"1Dc47Q","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/20/app-roundup-instagram-filters-medium-audio-stories-assistant/","content":{"plain":"Reading all the news from Google I/O may have kept you too busy to keep up with this week's app news.

As everyone from Microsoft to Samsung comes out with their own version, assistants are likely to be the next most important way to control your phone. Previously, operating systems were restrictive in nature. If you had an iPhone, Apple controlled your experience. Now with assistants like Siri, Google and Alexa being an increasingly dominant way to use your phone, it'll be the company that has the best assistant that will control your experience - and Google has a huge advantage with its knowledge graph.\nInstagram finally gets face filters \n\nAfter a months long feature by feature cloning of Snapchat, Instagram's finally gets Snapchat's most iconic feature - the lenses, or as Instagram calls them \"face filters.\" There are only eight filters for now, but Instagram is soon likely to have its own wide array of filters.\nMessenger gets a new layout\n\nFacebook Messenger has an all new home screen. It now contains tabs for Messages, people who are “Active now\" or online, and favorite groups. There’s also a new bottom bar for Home, Calls, Camera, People and Games. The Camera is a much more prominent part of Messenger than before, likely due to the Messenger Day feature. \nUber adds transit information to Android\n\nThe ride-hailing service announced on Tuesday that its Android app will now allow users to easily access real-time public transportation data. This means that you can easily plan trips like taking an Uber to the train station and coordinating your train times.

Instead of the siloed experiences that force you to open a new message thread each time you want to engage with a company or service, you can now take advantage of the bots inside the conversations you're already having.\nThese new bots, which Facebook has dubbed Chat Extensions, don't look anything like the clunky and overall pretty terrible bots that Facebook first introduced last year. They look and feel more like an app than an automated chatbot. \nBetter still, you don't have to actually chat with them. Spotify's extension allows you to share songs inside of chats, for example, while OpenTable's lets you make a reservation. \n\n\"The term 'bot' is very developer friendly and not super consumer friendly,\" Facebook's Messenger chief David Marcus told me. \"People don't necessarily know what a bot is or how to interact with a bot. What they want is to interact with Spotify or OpenTable or the NBA or get customer service.\"\nSo while Facebook isn't giving up on its conversational bots, the new Chat Extensions enable brands and businesses to create experiences that are much more intuitive and a lot less confusing.\n\nFacebook is also improving the discovery process so it's easier for people to find brands and businesses on Messenger. This will take two forms: a new \"discover\" tab inside of Messenger and a new feature that allows people to connect with bots by scanning QR codes with Messenger's in-app camera. \nElsewhere, Messenger is getting a bit of an AI refresh. M, the app's automated assistant feature, can now help groups of friends order food (via delivery.com) from within group chats. Eventually, Marcus says, M will be able to point users to Chat Extensions based on their conversations. \n\nFacebook is also introducing a new \"Smart Replies\" feature for small businesses that allows them to automatically respond to certain types of commonly asked questions, like inquiries about menu items or business hours. \nWhether or not all this will enough to make people give Messenger's bots a second look is another matter. Almost all the bots that launched with much fanfare at F8 last year were immediately disappointing. \nBut that hasn't stopped the company from steadily adding developers to the platform, which now counts thousands of bots. And with improvements to the UI and discoverability, the new bots might  actually end up finding someone to talk to. \nWATCH: Rihanna shined bright like a diamond in her one of kind Coachella outfit"},"shares":{"twitter":476,"facebook":272,"linked_in":28,"google_plus":5,"pinterest":3,"total":784},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hKKpaoni0Lr0Vj8sw8uPMFhQVQ0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43043%2Ff7f16717-55c9-404b-b589-2db6abca4852.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qlyQrasE6lSwrG8WuJZDPlyFgRU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43043%2Ff7f16717-55c9-404b-b589-2db6abca4852.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oSc2qeEImyGuI0tf8qubVEwoFy0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43043%2Ff7f16717-55c9-404b-b589-2db6abca4852.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mCWCFFG7b9FItSe8vOwC6qvilMI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43043%2Ff7f16717-55c9-404b-b589-2db6abca4852.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gYZ_WSxvxxX1bwYYknJs3pIcnBY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43043%2Ff7f16717-55c9-404b-b589-2db6abca4852.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DxY5AfConNEUz88Do6DuLnYnjP8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F43043%2Ff7f16717-55c9-404b-b589-2db6abca4852.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pPjokJ","display_title":"Facebook is giving Messenger bots a massive overhaul","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"V4l9rO6ogK","data-source":"blueprint"},{"data-id":"NfNHp1Ll","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Facebook is making its Messenger bots a lot more useful.

Oh no you don't — M thinks you should use a sticker instead. Planning a nice dinner with your partner? M is pretty sure you should take a Lyft or Uber and oh hey here are the ride options right in the middle of the screen. \n\nAs far as Facebook is concerned, M is more than just another pesky feature clunking up the chat interface. Rather, it's a \"helpful assistant\" that demands to be experienced. \n\"To experience M, simply chat with a friend or a group as you normally would,\" the press release continues. \"And M learns: the more you use it, the more it can help.\"\nAnd while M may be able to learn and improve with more use, those looking for a Jarvis-like experience shouldn't hold their breath. The assistant launched today is not nearly as sophisticated as the early hybrid human-AI system Facebook was testing back in 2015. \nFacebook isn't the first company to play with AI-assistants for messaging apps. Google's Allo, which launched in 2016, included a version of Google Assistant — the digital helper also found in Google Home — that would suggest replies and help with things like translations. \nFor those not excited about their new artificially intelligent helper? There is an option to disable M, though we doubt very much that M will help you figure out how to do that particular task. Even if you do turn off Clippy 2.0, don't expect this to be the last you'll ever hear of it from Facebook. \n\"But this is just the beginning for M…,\" the company ominously warns, \"expect to see more and more AI-powered, delightful and relevant experiences improving Messenger for you, every day.\" \nOh, joy.

When all you want is for your baby to stop crying so you can both get back to sleep, getting hold of reliable and relevant information as soon as possible is vital. In an effort to help out new nursing parents at exactly this dark hour, Public Health England (PHE) has launched an interactive Facebook Messenger chatbot to encourage longer breastfeeding relationships. \nSEE ALSO: This breast pump is legit quiet enough to use on a conference call\nIn a blog post announcing the chatbot, PHE chief executive Duncan Selbie said the UK has the lowest rate of breastfeeding mothers in the world, but the \"right support\" can keep mums breastfeeding for longer. The Start4Life BreastFeeding Friend chatbot – BFF for short – aims to address this need for support with a tool that's accessible during the wee  hours when healthcare professionals aren't available. This bot, as it turns out, probably won't give you the support you require. \"New babies need to be fed round the clock, and the peak times for online searches for breastfeeding help (by volume over 24 hours) are 2 and 6 a.m., when healthcare professionals and ‘phone helplines are not readily available,\" a spokesperson for PHE explained.Good point, and it makes sense to have around-the-clock access to trusted information. But the limitations of the bot are in how the information is obtained, not when. \nWhen you're a new parent, a lot of the questions you have are general – Why is my baby crying? How do I know if the baby is hungry? When you ask those questions, either to a person or the internet, you need to get back answers that are robust. Alas, this chatbot won't give them to you. The main problem seems to lie in the bot's ability – or lack thereof – to process natural language. If you ask the bot a general question in sentence form, you will not get the answer you're looking for. \n\nThe bot responds best when presented with shorter phrases and keywords, which will automatically throw up two or three paragraphs of advice. But being automated, it's limited in the number of keywords it responds to and you won't always get answers to questions that are specific enough to deal with your individual experience. \nGetting the most appropriate answer seems entirely dependent on knowing the exact question, which requires a level of knowledge that new parents might not have. And attempting to ask the perfect question while sleep deprived and emotional in the face of a crying baby seems like a rather miserable game, to put it mildly.\nCase in point, asking \"How many times a day should I nurse?\" doesn't get you an answer. That's only one of the most basic questions a new nursing mom would have. You know, NBD.\n\nThat said, there are solid step-by-step guides for latching on, expressing milk and introducing bottles, in addition to tips for feeding with and storing expressed milk. There's advice for increasing your milk supply, as well as information on things that can affect your supply and tips for stopping feeding. The FAQs are helpful. In fact, skipping the \"conversation\" and just checking those out is a pretty good way to go.\n\nThe bot provides easily-accessible basic advice on a platform where new mums are already likely to be. If you're one-handedly talking to a friend or family member on Messenger, then it's easy to fire off a message to the bot. But you'll very quickly run into the bot's limits and probably end up asking a human being for the information you need. Currently the bot isn't a substitute for the wealth of information that friends, family and medical professionals can provide; information that's backed up with a huge amount of personal experience. Parenting startup CEO Vivien de Tusch-Lec tried out the new bot to get some advice on phasing out breastfeeding. \"It gave me the advice I needed. It took a little while to get there, but not as long as trawling through myriad Google search results,\" says de Tusch-Lec.But de Tusch-Lec says she was left with more questions the bot was unable to answer. Despite this, she found it helpful for getting consistent and authoritative views and says she wishes it had existed when she started breastfeeding. \"It’s also useful as a quick reference tool where info is finely filtered according to questions, so ultimately I found it more accurate than other ways of finding info,\" she continued.\n\nKay Brown – who runs a baby and toddler group for mums in the digital sector – says she's on the fence as to whether the chatbot is a good idea. \"One of the greatest struggles when breastfeeding is getting the correct latch and a suitable position and this isn’t something a chatbot can tell or give you direct support with,\" Brown says.   But, freelance PR Gina Clarke – who breastfed both her children for a year – says she was desperately in need of something like this chatbot. \"Health visitor appointments could take days so I would often hang on for the breastfeeding helpline opening at 6am, but because it's staffed by volunteers I could rarely get through and had to turn to Dr Google quite a lot,\" says Clarke. At the same time, however, Clarke thinks that the bot is no replacement for IRL human support. \"It certainly shouldn't replace the health visitor as the human voice, but having some instant support would have been incredibly handy when I was breastfeeding,\" Clarke continues.  The chatbot is a great resource for providing trusted and instant advice for breastfeeding FAQs and it's certainly quicker and more reliable than trawling through Google. But, in its current state, it just doesn't go far enough to provide nuanced information for new mums who are figuring out how to do something they don't know how to do. For the time being, you're better off just heading to the NHS' breastfeeding website. \nWATCH: This breast pump is quiet enough to use on a conference call"},"shares":{"facebook":162,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":5,"twitter":318,"total":492},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oJXufD1rrzfStSCCtr-63vjX4eM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F425740%2F3e0283f7-591b-4678-ad0e-2d5f55d3ede5.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8mLTxpziyZnz0sc22a1M1HB3jOg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40634%2F305dfae4-5d80-400a-842d-4d03a4d9539c.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/v561PLdlVm6RY2ez1Vpd2i8gz1U=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40634%2F305dfae4-5d80-400a-842d-4d03a4d9539c.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NEFMd5zdzVPNbib3V6QO4fFE2XY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40634%2F305dfae4-5d80-400a-842d-4d03a4d9539c.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/CKScSlvqJhhUD9_VIYVPzZRo2pA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40634%2F305dfae4-5d80-400a-842d-4d03a4d9539c.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KZ6aJCQcgevIZ6iqTMtWWmfwnDE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40634%2F305dfae4-5d80-400a-842d-4d03a4d9539c.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2mJBKqb","display_title":"When you're up nursing at 3 a.m., this chatbot is definitely not your friend","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"R8jqUtrM","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Public Health England's new BreastFeeding Friend is more likely to drive you up a wall.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Lifestyle","channel_label":"Lifestyle","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/lifestyle/","tweet_text":"When you're up nursing at 3 a.m., this chatbot is definitely not your friend"},{"_id":"58d93b82f11b2c6368001606","id":"2017/03/27/how-to-turn-off-chat-heads-messenger","title":"How to decapitate annoying 'Chat Heads' in Facebook Messenger","title_tag":null,"author":"Freia Lobo","post_date":"2017-03-27T16:19:11+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 16:19:11 +0000","formatted_date":"03/27/2017","formatted_shares":"1.9k","sort_key":"1CSEgi","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/27/how-to-turn-off-chat-heads-messenger/","content":{"plain":"You never have to be interrupted by your friend's floating head again.\nChat Heads were introduced several years ago on Facebook Messenger for Android.

And no, it's not because Snapchat had them first. \nInstead, the company is taking two features straight out of Slack's playbook with the addition emoji-laden reactions and mentions.\nSEE ALSO: This guy spent 8 years making an emoji snake, and it was totally worth it\nReactions, which were first spotted in a \"small test\" earlier in the month, allow you to respond to individual messages within a thread with seven different emoji. Messenger's reactions differ slightly from those seen elsewhere on Facebook. \nIncluded in that group is a \"thumbs down\" emoji, which is probably the closest we'll ever get to an actual \"dislike\" button on Facebook. (The social network says the thumbs down represents a \"no\" reaction.)\n\nAdding a reaction inside a conversation in Messenger works just like reactions in News Feed: hold down on a message to select a response. If you're in a group chat and there are multiple reactions on a single message, they will all appear.\nAdding a reaction to a message will also trigger a notification to the person who sent the original message, so get ready for a lot more push notifications if you're using reactions in a group thread with a lot of participants.\nSpeaking of new push notifications, Facebook is also adding Slack-like @-mentions, so you can \"call out\" specific people in a chat. When you use mentions in Messenger, the person who you mentioned will get a different type of push notification letting them know (thankfully, Facebook is letting you disable these.)\n\nLike Slack, all you have to do to mention someone is begin a reply with @ and then add their name. Others in the conversation will also be able to see the mention and receive notifications as they normally would in a chat.\nIn addition to Messenger, Facebook is also bringing the new features to its own Slack competitor, Work Chat, the messaging tool inside Work Place, the social network's business communication tool.\nBoth mentions and reactions are launching now, with a full rollout expected to be finished in the next couple days, the company says.\nWATCH: Someone invented a desktop robot that’s perfect for DIY techies"},"shares":{"facebook":288,"twitter":460,"google_plus":21,"pinterest":4,"linked_in":65,"total":838},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Gzu_CYVdvP35jDgGJDqfunNKlRU=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F423564%2F01b88a55-413d-4b11-9a03-715e600b7f06.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RR0rIF68ZXr5vL2yA9Hzpjeoiqw=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40571%2Fcd109b8a-ad81-4147-b38f-b65986a8e7e8.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SBIZ0BpV0mwo1p-dXzAf20ebuz4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40571%2Fcd109b8a-ad81-4147-b38f-b65986a8e7e8.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/myyV-0fs-RATSuifTEZ3uRcSBR4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40571%2Fcd109b8a-ad81-4147-b38f-b65986a8e7e8.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KaU307t4qKCw-LwOC32x5Xq0hdA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40571%2Fcd109b8a-ad81-4147-b38f-b65986a8e7e8.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MYFtIhlLQowdz69nUi5bhaoz6_c=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40571%2Fcd109b8a-ad81-4147-b38f-b65986a8e7e8.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2nH2E1y","display_title":"Facebook Messenger is basically Slack now","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"QSFSIHwk","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Slack can't get a break.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Facebook Messenger is basically Slack now"},{"_id":"58d24b21f11b2c78bc0000a3","id":"2017/03/22/how-to-read-facebook-messenger-messages-no-read-receipts","title":"How to make sure your Facebook Messenger friends don't get read receipts","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2017-03-22T10:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 10:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"03/22/2017","formatted_shares":"1.7k","sort_key":"1CQHs3","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/22/how-to-read-facebook-messenger-messages-no-read-receipts/","content":{"plain":"Read receipts, the small confirmation that lets you know your friends on Facebook Messenger have seen your message(s), are supposed to be a good thing for everyone.\nBut they can also be a great source of anxiety, especially when you know that somebody has seen your message and they're not replying back.

The key to not activating the read receipt is to not engage with the incoming message -- because as soon as you open a message, either for a quick reply or within the Messenger app, it'll change the read receipt from a blue check mark (delivered) to your profile photo (read).\n\nFor the most part, it'll get the job done. But there's a small catch that might muddy things up a little: iOS notifications are limited to 162 characters, which means if you receive a message that's longer, you won't be able to see the whole thing, like so:\n\n2. Go into airplane mode\nAh...the ol' reliable airplane mode trick. If you know how to use airplane mode to hide your tracks or snoop with other apps (like Snapchat), this trick's basically the same.\nWith this workaround, you can prevent your read receipt from activating simply by switching on airplane mode, which turns off all Wi-Fi and cellular connections, after you've received messages.\nThe trick is simple: Turn on airplane mode, open Messenger, read all received messages, then – and this is very key, so don't forget it – quit the app (this is different from just closing the app and returning to the home screen; to quit Messenger, launch the multitasker and boot it) before switching airplane mode off.\n\nIf you don't quit Messenger, the next time you open the app and it reconnects to Facebook's servers, it'll sync up all your offline activity and your friends will know you read their messages.\n3. Use a Chrome extension\nPreventing your friends from seeing your read receipts isn't as straightforward on desktop as it is on mobile, and your success may vary depending on which Chrome extension you use and which version.\nFor example, we tried \"Facebook Chat Privacy\", which is supposed to block the \"seen\" and \"typing\" receipts, but it only disabled the latter.\nAnother Chrome extension called \"Unseen\", however worked almost perfectly and blocked the \"seen\" and \"typing\" receipts, but not the \"delivery receipts\".\n\nThere are tons of Chrome extensions available that claim to block read receipts, but the only way to really know if they work or not is to try them for yourself. (We make no promises that the extension versions that worked for us will work for you.)\nWATCH: Facebook stalkers confess their dark secrets"},"shares":{"google_plus":24,"facebook":1146,"twitter":487,"linked_in":18,"pinterest":3,"total":1678},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/36XGVoIT2WtcOwtTnITssQ1YJkA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F415168%2F857981f2-0a73-4095-9e72-e7d5583ac59c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7bEbVly4blJFNAqoWIPdqHmN8Nk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39763%2F223c8b9c-fc5f-4b13-b1f4-7e004caaebde.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E3KMIe7Ac8c1hxlUKyeLdwChRco=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39763%2F223c8b9c-fc5f-4b13-b1f4-7e004caaebde.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Jxrw9iXZWdFVC1mmHDtM_sR2yLM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39763%2F223c8b9c-fc5f-4b13-b1f4-7e004caaebde.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1PzlBJNx3-NEn6HIKaUuMQ1Whpo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39763%2F223c8b9c-fc5f-4b13-b1f4-7e004caaebde.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UYtyU-tMrQLQ2pqDTtbSbUXQv0g=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39763%2F223c8b9c-fc5f-4b13-b1f4-7e004caaebde.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ms0uDg","display_title":"How to make sure your Facebook Messenger friends don't get read receipts","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Nyanm5ZnK9","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Basically, how to be a creep.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How to make sure your Facebook Messenger friends don't get read receipts"},{"_id":"58bdc21d28cc3678a20000c5","id":"2017/03/06/facebook-will-never-make-a-dislike-button","title":"Sorry haters, you're never getting a dislike button on Facebook","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2017-03-06T20:10:02+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 06 Mar 2017 20:10:02 +0000","formatted_date":"03/06/2017","formatted_shares":"1.4k","sort_key":"1CL5s4","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/06/facebook-will-never-make-a-dislike-button/","content":{"plain":"If there's one Facebook rumor that absolutely refuses to die, it's that a dislike button might someday appear on the site.\nNo matter how many times Mark Zuckerberg says he will never, ever make one, at least once a year, it seems, a fresh rumor picks up steam. This time, rumors were stoked when it was discovered that the social network is doing a small test of a thumbs down reaction inside of Messenger.\nAt last, right? Not quite.\nSEE ALSO: You might want to rethink what you're 'liking' on Facebook now\nFacebook confirmed the test is real, but this doesn't mean we're any closer to getting anything resembling an actual dislike button.\nFor one, calling Messenger's thumbs down emoji the equivalent of a \"dislike\" is a bit of a stretch. Unlike Facebook's reactions, emoji in Messenger aren't labeled. And even if they were, adding a \"dislike\" to a message in a private conversation is entirely different than doing so on a Facebook post.\nThe dislike button may be coming soon...but on Facebook Messenger - https://t.co/yCryNRLqUe pic.twitter.com/nYdR1DQHNF— Android Community (@androids) March 6, 2017\n\nZuckerberg hasn't exactly helped the rumor mill, though: He's added ambiguous statements almost every time he's asked about the feature. \"We're thinking about it,\" he said in a 2014 Q&A. \nDig into the rest of Zuckerberg's answer, and you'll learn they never seriously thought about adding \"dislike\" to Facebook. An actual dislike option would be too negative and likely used for bullying, he said. \nZuckerberg has maintained that anything other than a \"like\" needs to be about creating empathy. \"We need to figure out the right way to do it so it ends up being a force for good, not a force for bad,\" the CEO said in the same interview. \nThat was the basis for reactions, the revamped like button Facebook introduced last year. Instead of just liking, you can react with  \"love,\" \"haha,\" \"wow,\" \"sad,\" and \"angry\"—but not \"dislike.\" And while Facebook hasn't ruled out adding more reactions in the future, you can be sure that \"dislike\" (or anything overtly negative) will never make the shortlist.\nAfter all, it could easily devolve into the trolling upvoting/downvoting dynamic that plays out on Reddit and so many other social platforms, not to mention Facebook's advertisers would probably hate it.\nZuckerberg wants Facebook to save the world. \"Disliking\" is not part of the vision. \nOr, as Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore summed it up in 2010 (did I mention this is the rumor that refuses to die?): \"Like buttons are about connection; Dislike buttons are about division.\" \nBONUS: These tattoos conduct electricity, turning you into a very basic cyborg"},"shares":{"facebook":880,"google_plus":16,"linked_in":26,"twitter":463,"pinterest":2,"total":1387},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ysOBF_5vBf8MJLCs0JeQcIVeOko=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F404933%2Fc1fec3c8-70c1-4a59-94e8-864bcd7e698f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/COIWj9xhtOcdsC_UxMfG6TwL81c=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38816%2F33104560-3dd0-41a1-b2dd-8fe7c85dc58d.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zVMQ3qQJYy3iXwz8mAL3wZZo2j0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38816%2F33104560-3dd0-41a1-b2dd-8fe7c85dc58d.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QFyP8ccjPKcHhjp5HrBA8k3htLg=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38816%2F33104560-3dd0-41a1-b2dd-8fe7c85dc58d.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FtgUnDd8iymTCcAGYBd2z5RwZWk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38816%2F33104560-3dd0-41a1-b2dd-8fe7c85dc58d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GGbkG8CBvDsLfhSiuSOLEJd4mXw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38816%2F33104560-3dd0-41a1-b2dd-8fe7c85dc58d.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2n7fD8O","display_title":"Sorry haters, you're never getting a dislike button on Facebook","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"mwpryGKB","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The Facebook rumor that refuses to die.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Sorry haters, you're never getting a dislike button on Facebook"},{"_id":"58bd836328cc3675220011a6","id":"2017/03/06/chatbot-donotpay-refugees-asylum-claim-legal-aid","title":"This chatbot helps refugees claim asylum, for free","title_tag":null,"author":"Gianluca Mezzofiore","post_date":"2017-03-06T15:42:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 06 Mar 2017 15:42:22 +0000","formatted_date":"03/06/2017","formatted_shares":"902","sort_key":"1CKVzr","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/06/chatbot-donotpay-refugees-asylum-claim-legal-aid/","content":{"plain":"Refugees struggling with asylum applications can now use a chatbot to get free legal aid in the US, Canada and the UK.\nDoNotPay, created by London-born Stanford student Joshua Browder, started out as an artificial-intelligence lawyer helping with parking tickets and delayed flights. \nAfter success in those areas -- it overturned more than 160,000 parking fines across London and New York for free -- lawyers and nonprofits reached out saying that the idea of automated legal services cold be extended to help refugees stranded in these countries. \n\"I hope it will allow anyone to have a right to safety, regardless of the ability to afford a lawyer,\" Browder, 20, told Mashable. \n\nThe chatbot works by asking users a series of questions to determine if they're eligible for asylum protection under international law, such as: \"Are you afraid of being subjected to torture in your home country?\"\nOnce the asylum claim is settled, it takes down details and automatically fills in a completed immigration application -- an I-589 for the United States, Canadian Asylum Application or an ASF1/application for the UK. \n\"Crucially, all the questions that the bot asks are in plain English and A.I. generated feedback appears during the conversation. For example, the best answer for your situation will include a description when the mistreatment started in your home country,\" Browder said. \n\nRefugees will also receive location specific submission instructions, details of additional documentation needed and resources for even more help. \nIn order to give free legal aid, DoNotPay relies on Facebook Messenger, which is not automatically end-to-end encrypted, as it is \"the most accessible platform and the most appropriate to launch with\". \n\"All data is deleted from my server after ten minutes and it is possible to wipe your data from Facebook Messenger,\" he said, acknowledging that privacy is a \"very important issue and it's important to be upfront with users\". \nFor the next steps, Browder wants to launch a dozen of new service including those related to pensions, benefits and bail. \n\"So many lawyers are charging hundreds of pounds simply for copying and pasting documents, so I hope to one day replace them.\"\nBONUS: Ikea designed a refugee shelter and it lasts 6x longer than traditional emergency tents"},"shares":{"google_plus":8,"facebook":268,"twitter":581,"linked_in":41,"pinterest":4,"total":902},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hVBTb4HtO7mV_4XPPNppuBo9Pyk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F404497%2Fb7b92a7a-50a0-4397-b4b7-10abff160db4.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ek9KFAk-Q2mu2OC2Eq4zsFnAgo4=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38761%2F9048b26a-e54a-45b7-bbfa-c7334c0ce361.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/EDbG4FMY0RohmsCt0PoTeuU9iWA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38761%2F9048b26a-e54a-45b7-bbfa-c7334c0ce361.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2H77N63oj6MI4W01rJYS5BNh7Cc=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38761%2F9048b26a-e54a-45b7-bbfa-c7334c0ce361.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/thZkGO71cG2u4a7KsgwZGvsmjR4=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38761%2F9048b26a-e54a-45b7-bbfa-c7334c0ce361.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HksQkdUiaUkkyxxNuGQ6OFIOmqE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38761%2F9048b26a-e54a-45b7-bbfa-c7334c0ce361.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2n6l5Zy","display_title":"This chatbot helps refugees claim asylum, for free","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"1lZaZj3e","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"DoNotPay offers free legal aid to refugees struggling with asylum applications in the UK, US and Canada.

All you have to do is download it on your computer and let it run in the background. Then, whenever a friend messages you on Facebook Messenger, the app will make it look as though you're typing indefinitely. It also tracks how long your friends have been waiting. Devious!\nWe tried the app, and it works perfectly. Just download the app, send your friend a serious-sounding message like \"hey, we need to talk,\" and sit back and let it work its magic.\n\nThe cleverly-named app is a reference to the Samuel Beckett play, Waiting for Godot, in which two characters wait for someone named Godot who never arrives.  \nDevelopers Iain Nash and Anastasis Germanidis made the Mac app in three hours at the \"Stupid Shit No One Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon,\" fondly known as Stupid Hackathon, \"a one-day event where participants conceptualize and create projects that have no value whatsoever\". The event is hosted and sponsored by NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. \n\"We mostly wanted to make something that would poke fun at the whole chatbot trend and eventually arrived at the idea,\" Germanidis said in an email. \"Hopefully it can get people to think about the ways in which small design choices in our communication apps, like the typing indicator or the read receipt, subtly alter the way we relate to one another, raising the level of anxiety in our interactions while providing little discernible benefit.\"\nSince the hackathon, the duo has also added a Windows version. The app can be downloaded here.\nBONUS: The most underrated entertainment of February is on our binge-list"},"shares":{"facebook":3286,"google_plus":21,"twitter":523,"linked_in":49,"pinterest":2,"total":3881},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-BVzu6GtVhTifSxPLHiQ8fEHOX8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F400567%2F96d28632-7fa1-4e17-b915-92205f9a57f8.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QvCcPhZrsSke-GU4a2EyBe7uFVQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38346%2F7887f3d3-7bcf-40de-8ec4-8b725c1546b6.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NTq_0TNLH_54PcZtirn0t6eJ6yY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38346%2F7887f3d3-7bcf-40de-8ec4-8b725c1546b6.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Ibh1usUDyjqpBTRJHZRBiOBT7e8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38346%2F7887f3d3-7bcf-40de-8ec4-8b725c1546b6.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BX9l-B_ddkciUb8hzIb_ph2-ou0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38346%2F7887f3d3-7bcf-40de-8ec4-8b725c1546b6.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZVGHZ8-wlI3ZPeH8MLMwkuyuJUM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F38346%2F7887f3d3-7bcf-40de-8ec4-8b725c1546b6.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2mfssBl","display_title":"This Messenger app will keep your friends anxiously waiting for your reply","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"bmuD39zO","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Deliciously evil.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"This Messenger app will keep your friends anxiously waiting for your reply"},{"_id":"58ac646528cc365082000519","id":"2017/02/21/facebook-messenger-bot-transferwise","title":"Now you can send money internationally through Facebook Messenger","title_tag":null,"author":"Emma Hinchliffe","post_date":"2017-02-21T16:01:38+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:01:38 +0000","formatted_date":"02/21/2017","formatted_shares":"16.9k","sort_key":"1CGdOs","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/21/facebook-messenger-bot-transferwise/","content":{"plain":"Sending money on Facebook is finally international. \nA new bot released on Facebook Messenger on Sunday lets users send money to and from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia or Europe. \nPowered by TransferWise, the bot completes money transfers and guides users through the process. \nTransferWise customers on the company's own app already send and receive almost $1 billion a month. The app boasts that it allows transfers without the usual fees charged by banks or hidden in exchange rates. Instead, TransferWise uses the current exchange rate and charges an upfront fee, usually based on 1 percent or so of the money being transferred. \n\nTransferWise's app allows customers to send money in plenty of other currencies outside North America and Europe, but its selection of currencies available on Facebook Messenger will be more limited. \nAlong with sending money, the Facebook bot will notify users about changing exchange rates and send alerts when it's a particularly good time to exchange a currency. \nFacebook has allowed users to send each other money through Messenger for several months, but only domestically. TransferWise's bot will be the first to facilitate international money transfers. That's a big deal — even Venmo is limited outside the United States. \n“Our mission at TransferWise is to bring faster, cheaper, and more convenient international money transfers to everyone in the world. Building the TransferWise bot for Messenger is a great step in that direction,\" TransferWise Head of Global Partnerships Scott Miller said in a statement. \"It’s also a powerful example of how our API can be used to seamlessly integrate TransferWise into almost any messaging, bank or business payment system.”\nFacebook and TransferWise have been linked before — most notably in rumors that the social network would buy the fintech startup. No acquisition yet, but a bot is a promising start. \nBONUS: Relive SpaceX's incredible daytime rocket landing with this video"},"shares":{"linked_in":1004,"facebook":15118,"google_plus":28,"twitter":765,"pinterest":4,"total":16919},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Kjh-GxBIGeq0E7oQPlnKvkd-5Jg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F389900%2Fd1d58014-30b9-425e-9573-a9a4af15c573.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dQ2PuL1bWceJaTLc_0beBXmBPtI=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37410%2F3def5c1e-e8d3-417b-b1bb-cf43617653ee.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QUUkdb1dKpEXAQ-nMzHaOaAocNY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37410%2F3def5c1e-e8d3-417b-b1bb-cf43617653ee.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/P6dD-uXbZqYDu9rFGI2huQlmstY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37410%2F3def5c1e-e8d3-417b-b1bb-cf43617653ee.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/v4gq4foKiXZiJrVas2QvOOHviUo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37410%2F3def5c1e-e8d3-417b-b1bb-cf43617653ee.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XyGW2edWfnO5OzZ7URDy7kXw4bs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37410%2F3def5c1e-e8d3-417b-b1bb-cf43617653ee.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2kViY9t","display_title":"Now you can send money internationally through Facebook Messenger","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"ojM8bRlZ","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Send money across the Atlantic with Facebook Messenger.

Valentine's Day\nMessage the Feminist Wingbot and it'll deliver a stream of pick-up lines for that lady you'd like to deliver a pick-up line to -- in a respectful way.\n\nThe bot aims to help people \"impress that feminist in your life\" by providing these empowering pick-up lines, complete with relevant gifs:\n\nThe chatbot was created by Dillah Zakbah, resident creative technologist at Bartle Bogle Hegarty's Singapore office.\n\nZakbah told Mashable that she was inspired to build the Feminist Wingbot from recent events such as the Women's March on Washington. \n\"It is apparent that the 'third wave' (of feminism) is now a shared topic that is of interest to most females,\" she said. \"There are a lot being talked about equality and feminism in the workplace, home (and) career, (but) not much about love life.\"\nThe chatbot now has roughly 50 pick-up lines, some Zakbah wrote, and others repurposed from pop culture references.\nZakbah wants to show that \"there can be many ways to impress a feminist.\" She adds: \"I just wanted to use this as proof, that you can be funny and cheeky, get the attention of the ladies without being too much of a jerk.\"\nBONUS: Across the globe,

And the company is worried that it could run out of ad space in its News Feed this year.\nSEE ALSO: Brands and their Facebook bots can now start conversations through ads\nThat's probably why Facebook is now turning to some untapped real estate: its Messenger platform.\nThe company announced Wednesday that it's testing new ads in Messenger that look a lot like ones you might see in your News Feed. \nThe ads are carousel-style, meaning that users can swipe sideways through posts from several different brands within the same frame. Mercifully, they don't appear in your actual conversations (at least not yet), but rather on the platform home screen below your most recent messages and \"favorite\" friend column.\n\nFacebook is currently only testing them on a \"very small\" group of users in Thailand and Australia.\nThe company also stresses that it won't use information gleaned from your private messages to target the ads, and brands can't start conversations with you unless you make the first move.\nThis isn't Facebook's first foray into Messenger advertising. The company rolled out an ad format last fall that allowed brands to insert conversational prompts into running chats with users.

To add to their woes, alternative messenger apps were also not easy to find.\nSEE ALSO: In an instant messaging world, a delayed response is anxiety inducing\nWhatsApp stopped working on a range of older smartphones on the New Year’s Eve. The Facebook-owned messaging app no longer supports smartphones running Android 2.2 Froyo, or older versions of Android, iPhones running iOS 6 or older, as well as the handful of smartphones running Windows Phone 7 or earlier version.\nAlthough these are quite old operating systems — Android 2.2, for instance, was released in 2010 — many people still use smartphones that cannot be upgraded to a newer version. And as a result of this, they have lost access to WhatsApp.\nWhatsApp is used by more than one billion users every month, as of February 2016. The app is quite popular worldwide, but in emerging markets such as that of India, it's nearly ubiquitous. As of November last year, over 160 million Indian users were reliant on the messenger. \nIt's going to be a tough ride finding an instant messaging app that still supports ancient phones. \nLast year, WhatsApp said it was a difficult decision for the company to cut access to older devices, but insisted that older mobile operating systems don't \"offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future.\"\nWhatsApp has matured over the years, picking up sophisticated and understandably resource-rich features such as voice calling, and video calling. From a security stand point, it has pushed end-to-end encryption and other improvements to all its users.\nPerhaps Android manufacturers should be blamed for some of this. Their \"policy\" to not push new software updates to existing Android-powered devices after a specific interval of time continues to strand millions of customers out of support cycle every month. In case of smaller brands and low-cost devices, the support life cycle is often shorter. \nAbout 0.1 percent of all Android devices still run Android 2.2. While that number may seem minuscule, it still amounts to a lot of Android devices. As of September 2015, there were about 1.4 billion active Android devices. That roughly translates to 1.4 million devices running Android 2.2 version. \nWhatsApp will also kill support for devices running BlackBerry 10 OS, or Nokia S40, or Nokia Symbian S60 operating system this June. The company had previously planned to cut support for these platforms at the end of 2016 as well, but later it gave them a little more time.  \nUsers on affected platforms could try other instant messaging services, but finding one that still supports their device is going to be a tough quest. \nTelegram, for instance, has also quietly pulled support for Android smartphones running versions older than 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. Facebook Messenger, also doesn’t likely support these older mobile operating system versions anymore.\nMicrosoft's Skype, similarly, doesn’t support Android devices running Android versions older than 4.0.3, and iPhones running iOS 7. Perhaps purchasing a new smartphone is the bet for people to continue to operate in this increasingly growing digital age.\nBONUS: WhatsApp’s Push-to-Talk Features and Other News you Need to Know\n\n "},"shares":{"facebook":622,"twitter":949,"google_plus":33,"total":1604},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OwbTXck2AIn1K4IgOJPgUtrwCIk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F334281%2Fc3e374f5-7973-4b07-8932-9dd28ae2f546.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jxgAKnNdxtE91VGtoj2CsYGRYXc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fBaYhOaGeQB87McejZ_pfGwwFSk=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bQV14gDw-8v0367IulJil4z4kPM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PcHdUJdwHiqKH9wywGRdP9rXjC0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WdL2cB1bGK0pQuoB7Bs39uFstWI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F32268%2Fb17f6179-edf5-488c-b805-db931bef1f26.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2ixTKhT","display_title":"Older smartphones get locked out of WhatsApp","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"RHzNFtir","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Time to upgrade.

Probably not.\nSEE ALSO: Tinder on TV is your new favourite party game\nMessenger launched a new and distinctly Snapchat-like tool complete with art and special effects on Thursday. The update lets users exchange photos with text, stickers, animated effects, illustrated frames and doodles. Sound familiar?\nHijacking your social life?\nPeter Martinazzi -- Facebook Messenger's director of product management -- told Mashable that Messenger's overall aim is to be a place where people share their feelings, make plans and hang out. He added that this new update intends to \"upgrade\" the existing conversations taking place on the app. \n\"This product is a byproduct of trends we’re seeing now,\" Martinazzi said. \"One of the biggest trends we’ve seen on mobile and on Messenger over the past few years is that people are getting more visual in their messages, using things like emoji and stickers. It’s something that’s growing faster than overall messaging is growing. And messaging overall is growing pretty fast.\" \nFacebook claims that it wants to make all of your conversations \"better than ever\". But to many this update feels like an attempt to compete with Snapchat and Instagram Stories. And, importantly, to keep socialising all in one place -- Messenger. Facebook might just be onto something -- why use three apps to talk to your friends when just one will do? \nSo, what's new? \nMessenger's new camera can be accessed on the \"home screen\" of the app -- the place where all your messages are listed. Now, all you have to do is tap the shutter button once to take a photo or hold down to record a video. \nThere's also a place to search for art and special effects too so you can slap on an \"artistic filter\" to your full-screen photo. And there are thousands more stickers, frames, masks and effects to choose from as well.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook is testing its Snapchat-like 'Messenger Day' in Australia\nIf you want to ask someone for a coffee or something to eat, there's artwork for that. If you want to tell someone you're feeling sad or happy, there's artwork for that. If you're just hanging out, binge-watching TV, there's artwork for that. If you want to transform your face into a panda or a reindeer, you guessed it, there's artwork for that. You'd be hard pressed for that level of choice on any other platform. \n\nThere's also a new feature that will let you jazz up your text messages. If you click on the palette icon next to the shutter icon, you will be taken to a \"blank canvas\" where you can select art and stickers to add to your text.\nUnlike the ephemeral nature of Snapchat, Messenger photos won't disappear after they're sent. And you won't get a notification if someone screenshots your photo. \n\nThe update essentially takes Messenger up a notch. You also have access to a tonne of art, not just a fixed number of filters. And, if you want to get a cheeky screen grab of what you've been sent, the sender will never know. Of course, if you just want to send a straight-up instant message to someone, then carry on as usual. Messenger is bringing you a hell of a lot of options and maybe -- just maybe -- a lot of reasons to stay off other apps. \nWhat distinguishes Messenger from Snapchat or Instagram?\nWhen asked by Mashable about what separates Messenger's update from Snapchat or Instagram Stories, Peter Martinazzi of Facebook was keen to demarcate Messenger as a distinct and different entity. He didn't want to discuss the goals of other apps saying this upgrade is \"built for messaging and for Messenger.\" \n\"Messenger’s really about your everyday interactions and your everyday communication. If you can make that everyday communication just that little bit better, then that’s a really big deal for people,\" Martinazzi said. \nAccording to Martinazzi, Facebook modifies its products as technology improves and as people's behaviour changes and this update is a modification to make the existing product better for people.\n\"We want to make it more fun and more expressive so you can get across what you’re trying to get across,\" he says.\nHow users will respond to the update remains to be seen. But, it certainly feels like Facebook is trying to give its users more and more reasons to keep those conversations going on Messenger, rather than taking them elsewhere. \nLet's not forget that Snapchat was the most-downloaded free iPhone app in 2016, with Messenger in second place. Will 2017 be the year that reverses those positions? Only time will tell. \nBONUS: People read their first Facebook post and it gets really awkward"},"shares":{"facebook":348,"twitter":567,"google_plus":17,"total":932},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JYD-l4ciB3vhtqWUa-vrzoiVoAQ=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F319547%2Fea0734cd-f330-4c5f-b937-5c6dd24da300.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MAr6taAzEjcsthLo2quTVuSr9-Q=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30992%2F860f576c-0776-4e2e-91fd-8a157b693ea6.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tbRiJVS6v-A7tGCmlySf_-8I0lM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30992%2F860f576c-0776-4e2e-91fd-8a157b693ea6.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zDy-lV59lH6zknHXR1oKNlGMvSg=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30992%2F860f576c-0776-4e2e-91fd-8a157b693ea6.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dOXEGv2S0nvg-ApJCqY6pPPu9VI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30992%2F860f576c-0776-4e2e-91fd-8a157b693ea6.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Sjw38LbAOlmMJqW9ifo8iwfySvg=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30992%2F860f576c-0776-4e2e-91fd-8a157b693ea6.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hKEOPJ","display_title":"Facebook Messenger's latest attempt to hijack your social life","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"RxVnZyR03g","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Could this be the go-to place for ALL social interaction?

Over time, the bot will make recommendations about weather and news information. \n“At The Weather Company, we want to create the best user experiences, and that means providing weather information and content in any format people want to receive it,” said Cameron Clayton, the general manager of The Weather Company, in a statement. \nThe bot is an interesting move for IBM and The Weather Company, since it could cause users who would have gone to weather.com or tuned into The Weather Channel to instead remain within Facebook's massive ecosystem. \nGiving up on that traffic and viewership is a tradeoff that the company feels is worthwhile considering the audience that can be reached on Facebook. \n“One billion people use Messenger every month, and most want to know how the weather will impact their day. The Weather Channel bot for Messenger will create a highly personalized experience for each one of those individuals,” Clayton said.  \nThe bot does, however, link back to weather.com's mobile website for extended forecasts. \nThe bot can be accessed on The Weather Channel's Facebook page as well as the Messenger app."},"shares":{"twitter":855,"facebook":844,"linked_in":33,"google_plus":6,"total":1738},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4tS4hr6JRjn9ToNgZ7y8otpbF9M=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F259576%2FIBMTWCWatsonBot.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wic28PNdGqdaTfO9hejB69B6AOw=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F25667%2FIBMTWCWatsonBot.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3fVbBoJmaMSIngkQcSFEysayxIo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F25667%2FIBMTWCWatsonBot.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/R_2vfDPSlQA9CW06ViYz1yLTbPc=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F25667%2FIBMTWCWatsonBot.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LOBPziAa_fa8k3JRvI2yFySR08Y=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F25667%2FIBMTWCWatsonBot.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DeZ4iOAbu-FwbEilleCzt0w-nVs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F25667%2FIBMTWCWatsonBot.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2dGj2pP","display_title":"The Weather Company enters the chatbot game for Facebook Messenger","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The Weather Company is bringing its forecasts to Facebook Messenger.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"The Weather Company enters the chatbot game for Facebook Messenger"},{"_id":"57f8fff7f11b2c49e6002216","id":"2016/10/08/facebook-messenger-bot-voter-registration","title":"New Facebook messenger bot wants to help you register to vote","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2016-10-08T14:17:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 08 Oct 2016 14:17:22 +0000","formatted_date":"10/08/2016","formatted_shares":"1.7k","sort_key":"1BSTKm","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/10/08/facebook-messenger-bot-voter-registration/","content":{"plain":"Getting help with voting registration can now be as simple as a quick chat with a bot.\nThe Ad Council just launched an automated tool within Facebook's messenger platform designed to walk prospective ballot casters through the sign-up process and provide election-day logistic information with a bit more personality than the average online form.\nThe nonprofit PSA maker is hoping the program, named GoVoteBot, will not only simplify and personalize the task, but also provide some amusement along the way.  \n\"It has a bit of a cheeky personality,\" said the Ad Council's VP of campaign development, Dzu Bui. \"But it's completely nonpartisan -- it has no opinion on who you vote for.\" \nSEE ALSO: John Cena reminds everyone what the average American looks like in patriotic PSA\nType a simple introductory greeting to the bot, and it will respond with a dropdown menu of options including a polling location finder and absentee options in addition to registration options and links.\nOnce you inform the bot that the process is completed, it responds with a celebratory note: \"You’re looking at one proud GoVoteBot!\"\n\nThe integration is made possible by data pulled from Google Civic -- the search giant's repository of electoral information -- and the U.S. Vote Foundation. \nFacebook is donating free ad space to promote the effort, along with several ad networks and media companies. The campaign also involves outdoor digital billboards and a forthcoming online commercial.\nThe Ad Council, which is committed to non-partisanship in all of its campaigns, has a decades-long history of encouraging civic engagement. But this project marks the first time it has ever experimented with automated bots. \nThe original plan for the campaign was even more ambitious -- a full-scale online voting system -- but the group quickly realized that the individual state rules governing such an undertaking would entail an impractical amount of help from the federal government.\nSo the creative team pivoted and decided a tool within Facebook's newly launched bot network might pique the interest of young people, who are notoriously apt to be no-shows at the polls.\n\"We set out to encourage millennials to vote, but wanted to find a fun and simple way to have a conversation where they are,\" said Chloe Gottlieb, the EVP and executive creative director at ad agency R/GA, which partnered with the Ad Council on the campaign.\n\"For us, it made sense to create this on Facebook Messenger. We designed it to pull in thousands of data points from all 50 states and then streamed it into one interface [participants] could use quickly and easily.”\nMore specifically, the Facebook ads will target newly eligible voters and people who've just moved, two groups especially likely to skip registration, according to various studies. \nFacebook first launched its big bot push in April at its annual F8 developer conference, although the initial batch left a lot to be desired. By July, the number of bots on the platform had grown to 11,000.\nTo strike up a conversation with GoVoteBot, simply type its name into a new message window in the Messenger app, standalone website or chat bar on the Facebook homepage."},"shares":{"facebook":446,"twitter":1126,"google_plus":15,"linked_in":127,"total":1714},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jXNmLV9ZW0gRijk19jSEzR78U9s=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F239504%2FGettyImages-152843420.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3p4AwrOAPZHhUjIXv1gvfl89Hzk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23780%2FGettyImages-152843420.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yUSkQrgrA_O_dvhb7P08uLZIJis=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23780%2FGettyImages-152843420.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cC1xiivJG8pTWP09RPfmhO97F4E=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23780%2FGettyImages-152843420.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_wMEACwu5YO94wJQ8_970xu_2CE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23780%2FGettyImages-152843420.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q-nowRte8z0pMcr8hV1UPvG6XCM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23780%2FGettyImages-152843420.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2dS7gu7","display_title":"New Facebook messenger bot wants to help you register to vote","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"\"It has a bit of a cheeky personality.\"","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"New Facebook messenger bot wants to help you register to vote"},{"_id":"57f4a166f11b2c350c000d4e","id":"2016/10/05/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-rollout","title":"You can now encrypt your Facebook Messenger chats","title_tag":null,"author":"Manish Singh","post_date":"2016-10-05T06:44:50+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 05 Oct 2016 06:44:50 +0000","formatted_date":"10/05/2016","formatted_shares":"2.7k","sort_key":"1BRHUm","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/10/05/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/","content":{"plain":"Your Facebook Messenger chats can now be secure from prying eyes -- with a few caveats.\nFacebook began implementing end-to-end encryption to all of its 900 million Messenger users earlier this year, and that roll-out has finished, the company told Wired Tuesday.\nSEE ALSO: WhatsApp vs. Signal vs. Google Allo: Which app is best for privacy?\nThe privacy-centric feature is available as \"secret conversations,\" on the top right of Messenger's \"new message\" screen. In addition to texts and photos, Facebook has put the encryption layer on stickers as well, but videos and GIFs are not included. Furthermore, the feature doesn't work for group chats, and it needs to be turned on for each individual conversation. \n\nFacebook is also offering users Snapchat-like ability to have their messages self-destruct after a specified duration. To get these features, you need to ensure Messenger app is updated on your Android phone or iPhone. There's no word on what happens to Windows Phone (or Windows 10 Mobile, as they like to call it now) users. \nOnce you have enabled Secret Conversations, Messenger will encrypt conversations, preventing any unauthorized party - including hackers and government agencies - from decoding your chats. \nSecret Conversations utilizes the reliable and highly commendable Signal protocol for encryption. \"Your messages are already secure, but Secret Conversations are encrypted from one device to another,\" Messenger app affirms when you use the feature. \nThe announcement follows Facebook’s other instant messaging app WhatsApp getting end-to-end encryption earlier this year. Though people have always showed some concern about their privacy, revelations of government-led surveillance programs by whistleblower Edward Snowden made them more conscious about their privacy and digital rights."},"shares":{"twitter":944,"facebook":1695,"google_plus":18,"linked_in":50,"stumble_upon":29,"total":2736},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xa3JPhGYVPW-GzWUZQ365u1iouA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F235413%2FAP_16190540073121.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6zMaBMTfdpLO1qxh5aY6oBKxHFA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23388%2FAP_16190540073121.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fM_Xf7rvwEliOOPnVfwLtL_QCGM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23388%2FAP_16190540073121.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XAf7OPpb893j9lumH623J6YTfBA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23388%2FAP_16190540073121.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/NAlAkOjWqcECOuf34ABVe3g4508=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23388%2FAP_16190540073121.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7mDHBTlXV5BdSqBeR38kwPJ0pa0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F23388%2FAP_16190540073121.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2dIEM5F","display_title":"You can now encrypt your Facebook Messenger chats","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"You will have to enable it manually, however.
