<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term <i>New York minute<\/i>. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed <i>New York<\/i> after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the world's \"heart\" and its \"Crossroads\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 469 stations in operation. Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<\/p>","id":134,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"new-york-ny-us","local_url":"\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":55,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2013-06-04T15:19:28","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","daily_count":8,"recent_count":5,"longitude":-74.007118,"name":"New York, NY, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=134","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":40.71455,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/134\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":55,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CK","item_count":10509,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:33:44.077637","image_height":674,"geohash":"dr5regvetxd9","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9d\/NYC_Montage_2014_4_-_Jleon.jpg\/512px-NYC_Montage_2014_4_-_Jleon.jpg","woeid":2459115,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:10:30.087894","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=9276","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Times Square<\/b> is a major commercial intersection and neighborhood in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and stretching from West 42nd to West 47th Streets. Brightly adorned with billboards and advertisements, Times Square is sometimes referred to as The Crossroads of the World, The Center of the Universe, the heart of The Great White Way, and the \"heart of the world\". One of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually. Approximately 330,000 people pass through Times Square daily, many of them tourists, while over 460,000 pedestrians walk through Times Square on its busiest days.<\/p>\n<p>Formerly known as <b>Longacre Square<\/b>, Times Square was renamed in 1904 after <i>The New York Times<\/i> moved its headquarters to the newly erected Times Building, the site of the annual ball drop which began on December 31, 1907, and continues today, attracting over a million visitors to Times Square every New Year's Eve.<\/p>\n<p>Times Square is not a square in the geometric sense of a polygon, but is more of a bowtie shape, or two triangles emanating roughly north and south from 45th Street.

The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced by firework devices. Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places.<\/p>\n<p>Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke, and floating materials (confetti for example). They may be designed to burn with colored flames and sparks including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and silver. Displays are common throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.<\/p>\n<p>Fireworks were invented in ancient China in the 7th century to scare away evil spirits, as a natural extension of the Four Great Inventions of ancient China of gunpowder. Such important events and festivities as Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Moon Festival were and still are times when fireworks are guaranteed sights. China is the largest manufacturer and exporter of fireworks in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Fireworks are generally classified as to where they perform, either as a ground or aerial firework. In the latter case they may provide their own propulsion (skyrocket) or be shot into the air by a mortar (aerial shell).<\/p>\n<p>The most common feature of fireworks is a paper or pasteboard tube or casing filled with the combustible material, often pyrotechnic stars. A number of these tubes or cases are often combined so as to make, when kindled, a great variety of sparkling shapes, often variously colored. The skyrocket is a common form of firework, although the first skyrockets were used in war. The aerial shell, however, is the backbone of today's commercial aerial display, and a smaller version for consumer use is known as the festival ball in the United States. Such rocket technology has also been used for the delivery of mail by rocket and is used as propulsion for most model rockets.<\/p>","id":2043,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"fireworks","local_url":"\/topic\/fireworks\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-06-22T16:37:18","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/fireworks\/","daily_count":7,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"fireworks","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2043","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2043\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"EntertainmentEvent","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fireworks","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/g7","item_count":394,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:57:57.252108","image_height":270,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b2\/OperaSydney-Fuegos2006-342289398.jpg\/512px-OperaSydney-Fuegos2006-342289398.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:10:30.087894","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fireworks\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7306","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>New Year's Day<\/b>, also called simply <b>New Year's<\/b> or <b>New Year<\/b>, is observed on January 1, the first day of the year on the modern Gregorian calendar as well as the Julian calendar.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.<\/p>\n<p>Founded under the name of <i>Byzantion<\/i> (Βυζάντιον) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE, the city developed to become one of the most significant in history. After its reestablishment as <i>Constantinople<\/i> in 330 CE, it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires. It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul's strategic position on the historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.<\/p>\n<p>Approximately <span>12.56 million<\/span> foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five years after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the world's fifth most popular tourist destination. The city's biggest attraction is its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's natural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyoğlu district. Considered a global city, Istanbul has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world. It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion, Istanbul has bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years.<\/p>","id":3515,"ping_category":[],"image_width":502,"slug":"istanbul-istanbul-tr","local_url":"\/topic\/istanbul-istanbul-tr\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-05-31T09:13:40","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/istanbul-istanbul-tr\/","daily_count":23,"recent_count":5,"longitude":28.986179,"name":"Istanbul, İstanbul, Turkey","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3515","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":41.040852,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3515\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/4r","item_count":861,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:31:01.450049","image_height":838,"geohash":"sxk97x70e6m2","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/Istanbul_collage_5j.jpg","woeid":2344116,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=467","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Turkey<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/ɜːr\/ 'ir' in 'bird'\">ɜːr<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Turkish: <span lang=\"tr\"><i>Türkiye<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈtyɾcije]<\/span>), officially the <b>Republic of Turkey<\/b> (Turkish: <span><span><span> <\/span><i>Türkiye Cumhuriyeti<\/i><\/span> <\/span>; <small>pronounced <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈtyɾcije d͡ʒumˈhuɾijeti]<\/span>), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly on the Anatolian peninsula in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location between Europe and Asia has retained its geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations, as well as Assyrians, Greeks, Thracians, Phrygians, Urartians and Armenians. After Alexander the Great's conquest, the area was Hellenized, a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks.<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period. The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century, especially during the reign (1520–1566) of Suleiman the Magnificent. The empire remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks such as the Great Turkish War (1683–99) and the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which aimed to modernise the Ottoman state, proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire.<\/p>\n<p>Suspended by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1878, the Ottoman constitution and parliament were restored with the Young Turk Revolution on 24 July 1908. Taking advantage of the chaos, Bulgaria formally declared its independence on 5 October 1908, and Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6 October 1908. The Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912) encouraged the Balkan League to declare the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), which caused the Ottoman Empire to lose the majority of its remaining territories in Europe and triggered the largest ethnic cleansing of Turks in the Balkan peninsula since the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), resulting in the mass migrations of Turks to Anatolia. The disappointment in these losses led to the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas, who decided to join the Central Powers of World War I (1914–1918) which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers. During the war, the Ottoman government committed ethnic cleansing or genocide against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.<\/p>\n<p>The Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922), initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues in Anatolia against the occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey's official language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by 84.5% of the population. According to polls, between 78.1% and 81.3% of the country's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks. Other ethnic groups include legally recognised (Armenians, Greeks, Jews) and unrecognised (Kurds, Circassians, Arabs, Albanians, Bosniaks, Georgians, etc.) minorities. Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group, making up approximately 13.4% to 18% or up to 25% of the population, based on polls and estimates. The vast majority of the population is nominally Sunni Muslim, with Alevis making up the largest religious minority.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is a charter member of the UN, an early member of NATO, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, applied for full EEC membership in 1987, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power.<\/p>","id":467,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"turkey","local_url":"\/topic\/turkey\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:41:28","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/turkey\/","daily_count":16,"recent_count":4,"longitude":35.431702,"name":"Turkey","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=467","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":38.957741,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/467\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hh","item_count":4770,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:23:54.792028","image_height":341,"geohash":"sycjwk0943wk","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b4\/Flag_of_Turkey.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png","woeid":23424969,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=350393","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Süleyman Soylu<\/b> (born November 21, 1969) is a Turkish politician.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". <b>Warfare<\/b> refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests which was greater than 41 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.<\/p>","id":15,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"war-conflict","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":17,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":34,"recent_count":8,"longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":17,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","item_count":46131,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:44.507639","image_height":316,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg\/512px-Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Edfc","url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","note":null,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Jan 01, 2017, 05:06 AM GMT","latitude":null,"sponsor":null,"pushed":true,"data":null,"url_text":"End of alert","date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464"},{"source":null,"id":1066730,"type":"text","slug":"police-burundi-minister-assassinated-in-the","push_content":"Police: Burundi minister assassinated in the capital- AFP","local_url":"\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/police-burundi-minister-assassinated-in-the","tweet":{"screen_name":"AFP","content":"#BREAKING Burundi minister assassinated in the capital: police","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/697343883630481408\/c08JBfBB_normal.jpg","user_id":"380648579","id":756115,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AFP\/status\/815421216785735681","location":"France","name":"AFP news agency","tweet_id":"815421216785735681","date":"2017-01-01T04:55:42"},"whoas":356,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AFP\/status\/815421216785735681","updated_date":"2017-01-01T05:23:02.886948","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AFP\/status\/815421216785735681","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iSyAy0","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/police-burundi-minister-assassinated-in-the","url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","longitude":null,"importance":3,"content":"Police: Burundi minister assassinated in the capital - AFP","status":"published","author":{"first_name":"Tom","id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1066730\/","media":null,"ping":null,"topics":[{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1151","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Burundi<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʊ\/ short 'oo' in 'foot'\">ʊ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ or \/ə\/ 'e' in 'roses'\">ᵻ<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> or <span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>), officially the <b>Republic of Burundi<\/b> (Kirundi: <span lang=\"rn\"><i>Republika y'Uburundi<\/i><\/span>, <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[buˈɾundi]<\/span>; French: <span lang=\"fr\"><i>République du Burundi<\/i><\/span>, <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[buʁundi]<\/span> or <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[byʁyndi]<\/span>), is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of East Africa, bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. It is also considered part of Central Africa. Burundi's capital is Bujumbura. The southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika.<\/p>\n<p>The Twa, Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent kingdom, until the beginning of the twentieth century, when Germany colonized the region. After the First World War and Germany's defeat, it ceded the territory to Belgium. Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi. Despite common misconceptions, Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonization. The European intervention exacerbated social differences between the Tutsi and Hutu, and contributed to political unrest in the region. Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a monarchy, but a series of assassinations, coups, and a general climate of regional instability culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966. Bouts of ethnic cleansing and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the 1970s and again in the 1990s left the country undeveloped and its population as one of the world's poorest. 2015 witnessed large-scale political strife as President Pierre Nkurunziza opted to run for a third term in office, a coup attempt failed and the country's parliamentary and presidential elections were broadly criticized by members of the international community.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to poverty, Burundians often have to deal with corruption, weak infrastructure, poor access to health and education services, and hunger. Burundi is densely populated and has had substantial emigration as young people seek opportunities elsewhere.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.<\/p>\n<p>Founded under the name of <i>Byzantion<\/i> (Βυζάντιον) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE, the city developed to become one of the most significant in history. After its reestablishment as <i>Constantinople<\/i> in 330 CE, it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires. It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul's strategic position on the historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.<\/p>\n<p>Approximately <span>12.56 million<\/span> foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five years after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the world's fifth most popular tourist destination. The city's biggest attraction is its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's natural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyoğlu district. Considered a global city, Istanbul has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world. It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic product.

Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location between Europe and Asia has retained its geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations, as well as Assyrians, Greeks, Thracians, Phrygians, Urartians and Armenians. After Alexander the Great's conquest, the area was Hellenized, a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks.<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period. The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century, especially during the reign (1520–1566) of Suleiman the Magnificent. The empire remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks such as the Great Turkish War (1683–99) and the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which aimed to modernise the Ottoman state, proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire.<\/p>\n<p>Suspended by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1878, the Ottoman constitution and parliament were restored with the Young Turk Revolution on 24 July 1908. Taking advantage of the chaos, Bulgaria formally declared its independence on 5 October 1908, and Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6 October 1908. The Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912) encouraged the Balkan League to declare the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), which caused the Ottoman Empire to lose the majority of its remaining territories in Europe and triggered the largest ethnic cleansing of Turks in the Balkan peninsula since the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), resulting in the mass migrations of Turks to Anatolia. The disappointment in these losses led to the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas, who decided to join the Central Powers of World War I (1914–1918) which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers. During the war, the Ottoman government committed ethnic cleansing or genocide against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.<\/p>\n<p>The Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922), initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues in Anatolia against the occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey's official language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by 84.5% of the population. According to polls, between 78.1% and 81.3% of the country's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks. Other ethnic groups include legally recognised (Armenians, Greeks, Jews) and unrecognised (Kurds, Circassians, Arabs, Albanians, Bosniaks, Georgians, etc.) minorities. Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group, making up approximately 13.4% to 18% or up to 25% of the population, based on polls and estimates. The vast majority of the population is nominally Sunni Muslim, with Alevis making up the largest religious minority.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is a charter member of the UN, an early member of NATO, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, applied for full EEC membership in 1987, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power.<\/p>","id":467,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"turkey","local_url":"\/topic\/turkey\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:41:28","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/turkey\/","daily_count":16,"recent_count":4,"longitude":35.431702,"name":"Turkey","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=467","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":38.957741,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/467\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hh","item_count":4770,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:23:54.792028","image_height":341,"geohash":"sycjwk0943wk","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b4\/Flag_of_Turkey.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png","woeid":23424969,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","livevideo":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, a <b>crime<\/b> is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.

In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". <b>Warfare<\/b> refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests which was greater than 41 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.<\/p>","id":15,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"war-conflict","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":17,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":34,"recent_count":8,"longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":17,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","item_count":46131,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:44.507639","image_height":316,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg\/512px-Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdfS","url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","note":null,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Jan 01, 2017, 04:58 AM GMT","latitude":null,"sponsor":null,"pushed":true,"data":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","date":"2017-01-01T04:58:36.732167"},{"source":null,"id":1066726,"type":"text","slug":"new-york-police-department-to-redeploy-some","push_content":"New York Police Department to redeploy some counter-terror teams and patrol units to nightclubs across the city as as a precaution after Istanbul attack - NBC News","local_url":"\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/new-york-police-department-to-redeploy-some","tweet":null,"whoas":319,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/new-york-police-department-to-redeploy-some","updated_date":"2017-01-01T04:55:59.278964","url":"","shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdfQ","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/new-york-police-department-to-redeploy-some","url_domain":"breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","longitude":null,"importance":2,"content":"New York Police Department to redeploy some counter-terror teams and patrol units to nightclubs across the city as as a precaution after Istanbul attack - NBC News","status":"published","author":{"first_name":"Tom","id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1066726\/","media":null,"ping":null,"topics":[{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=374835","livevideo":"","description":"<p>A mass shooting occurred at a nightclub in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul on 1 January 2017 at about 01:30 local time, killing at least 35 people.

With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term <i>New York minute<\/i>. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed <i>New York<\/i> after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the world's \"heart\" and its \"Crossroads\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 469 stations in operation.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society.

Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

The name <i>Korea<\/i> is derived from one of them, Goguryeo, also known as <i>Koryŏ<\/i>, which was a powerful empire and one of the great powers in East Asia, ruling Northeast China, parts of Russia and Inner Mongolia, and more than two-thirds of the Korean Peninsula under Gwanggaeto the Great. Since their unification into Later Silla and Balhae in the 7th century, Korea enjoyed over a millennium of relative tranquility under long lasting dynasties, with innovations like Hangul, the unique alphabet created by Sejong the Great in 1446, enabling anyone to easily learn to read and write. Its rich and vibrant culture left 17 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, the third largest in the world, along with 12 World Heritage Sites. Annexed by Imperial Japan in 1910 due to its strategic and central location, Korea was divided into North and South after its surrender in 1945. A North Korean invasion led to the Korean War (1950–53). Peace has since mostly continued with the two agreeing to work peacefully for reunification and the South solidifying peace as a regional power with the world's 10th largest defence budget.<\/p>\n<p>South Korea's tiger economy soared at an annual average of 10% for over 30 years in a period of rapid transformation called the Miracle on the Han River. A long legacy of openness and focus in innovation made it successful. Today, it is the world's fifth largest exporter and seventh largest importer with the G20's largest budget surplus and highest credit rating of any country in East Asia. It has free trade agreements with 75% of the world economy and is the only G20 nation trading freely with China, the US and EU simultaneously. In 1987, it became a multi-party democracy with universal suffrage and is today Asia's most advanced democracy with high government transparency, universal healthcare and freedom of religion. High civil liberties led to the rise of a globally influential pop culture such as K-pop and K-drama, a phenomenon called the Korean Wave, known for its distinctive fashionable and trendy style. Home of the UN Green Climate Fund and GGGI, South Korea is a leader in low carbon green growth, committed to helping developing countries as a major DAC and Paris Club contributor. It is the OECD's most welcoming country by visa-free entry to foreigners and rated highly in peaceful tolerance and inclusion of minorities.<\/p>\n<p>South Korea is East Asia's most developed country in the Human Development Index. It has the world's eighth highest median household income, the highest in Asia, and its singles in particular earn more than all G7 nations. Globally, it ranks highly in personal safety, education, job security, ease of doing business and healthcare quality, with the world's third highest health adjusted life expectancy and fourth most efficient healthcare system. With a highly educated and skilled labour force, the country leads the OECD in graduates in science and engineering and is ranked third in the Youth Wellbeing Index. Home of Samsung, the world's leading smartphone and TV maker, LG and Hyundai-Kia, South Korea was named the world's most innovative country in the Bloomberg Innovation Index, ranking first in business R&amp;D intensity and patents filed per GDP.

Before his election as president, he was the CEO of Hyundai Engineering and Construction, as well as the mayor of Seoul from 1 July 2002, to 30 June 2006. He is married to Kim Yoon-ok and has three daughters and one son. His older brother, Lee Sang-deuk, is a South Korean politician. He attends the Somang Presbyterian Church. Lee is a graduate of Korea University and received an honorary degree from Paris Diderot University on 13 May 2011.<\/p>\n<p>Lee altered the Japanese-South Korean government's approach to North Korea, preferring a more hardline strategy in the wake of increased provocation from the North, though he was supportive of regional dialogue with Russia, China and Japan. Under Lee, South Korea increased its visibility and influence in the global scene, resulting in the hosting of the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit. However, significant controversy remains in Korea regarding high-profile government initiatives which have caused some factions to engage in civil opposition and protest against the incumbent government and President Lee's Saenuri Party (formerly the Grand National Party). The reformist faction within the Saenuri Party is at odds against Lee. He ended his five-year term on 25 February 2013, and was succeeded by Park Geun-hye.<\/p>","id":7245,"ping_category":[],"image_width":421,"slug":"lee-myung-bak","local_url":"\/topic\/lee-myung-bak\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-05-24T01:30:29","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/lee-myung-bak\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"Lee Myung-bak","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7245","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7245\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Person","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Myung-bak","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B21","item_count":41,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:14:55.339537","image_height":511,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/72\/Sebasti%C3%A1n_Pi%C3%B1era_-_Lee_Myung-bak_%28cropped%29.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:45:14.988428","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lee_Myung-bak\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=24752","livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>Saenuri Party<\/b> (Hangul: <span lang=\"ko-Hang\">새누리당<\/span>; Hanja: <span lang=\"ko-Hani\">새누리黨<\/span>; RR: <i><span title=\"Korean transliteration\">Saenuri-dang<\/span><\/i>; lit. <b>New Frontier Party<\/b>) is a centre-right political party in South Korea.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","id":2,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"politics","local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":2,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","daily_count":27,"recent_count":5,"longitude":null,"name":"politics","twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","image_height":503,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdfF","url_external_text":"Read more on yonhapnews.co.kr","note":null,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Jan 01, 2017, 04:45 AM GMT","latitude":null,"sponsor":null,"pushed":true,"data":null,"url_text":"Read more on yonhapnews.co.kr","date":"2017-01-01T04:45:14.988428"},{"source":null,"id":1066712,"type":"text","slug":"media-reports-8-of-the-wounded-in-the-istanbul","push_content":"Media reports: 8 of the wounded in the Istanbul nightclub attack are in critical condition - Al Jazeera","local_url":"\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/media-reports-8-of-the-wounded-in-the-istanbul","tweet":null,"whoas":191,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/media-reports-8-of-the-wounded-in-the-istanbul","updated_date":"2017-01-01T04:37:37.590981","url":"","shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdfC","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/media-reports-8-of-the-wounded-in-the-istanbul","url_domain":"breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","longitude":null,"importance":3,"content":"Media reports: 8 of the wounded in the Istanbul nightclub attack are in critical condition - Al Jazeera","status":"published","author":{"first_name":"Tom","id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1066712\/","media":null,"ping":null,"topics":[{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=374835","livevideo":"","description":"<p>A mass shooting occurred at a nightclub in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul on 1 January 2017 at about 01:30 local time, killing at least 35 people.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.<\/p>\n<p>Founded under the name of <i>Byzantion<\/i> (Βυζάντιον) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE, the city developed to become one of the most significant in history. After its reestablishment as <i>Constantinople<\/i> in 330 CE, it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires. It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul's strategic position on the historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.<\/p>\n<p>Approximately <span>12.56 million<\/span> foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five years after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the world's fifth most popular tourist destination. The city's biggest attraction is its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's natural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyoğlu district. Considered a global city, Istanbul has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world. It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion, Istanbul has bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years.<\/p>","id":3515,"ping_category":[],"image_width":502,"slug":"istanbul-istanbul-tr","local_url":"\/topic\/istanbul-istanbul-tr\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-05-31T09:13:40","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/istanbul-istanbul-tr\/","daily_count":23,"recent_count":5,"longitude":28.986179,"name":"Istanbul, İstanbul, Turkey","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3515","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":41.040852,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3515\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/4r","item_count":861,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:31:01.450049","image_height":838,"geohash":"sxk97x70e6m2","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/Istanbul_collage_5j.jpg","woeid":2344116,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","livevideo":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, a <b>crime<\/b> is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.

One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". <b>Warfare<\/b> refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests which was greater than 41 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.<\/p>","id":15,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"war-conflict","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":17,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":34,"recent_count":8,"longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":17,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","item_count":46131,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:44.507639","image_height":316,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg\/512px-Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdfC","url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","note":null,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Jan 01, 2017, 04:37 AM GMT","latitude":null,"sponsor":null,"pushed":true,"data":null,"url_text":"End of alert","date":"2017-01-01T04:37:36.689822"},{"source":null,"id":1066710,"type":"text","slug":"philippine-authorities-report-4-victims-of-stray","push_content":"Philippine authorities report 4 victims of stray bullets, one of which is a 15-year-old girl from Malabon now on life support - GMA News","local_url":"\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/philippine-authorities-report-4-victims-of-stray","tweet":{"screen_name":"gmanews","content":"DOH reports 4 victims of stray bullets, one of which is a 15 yr old girl from Malabon who's in life support at the JRRMC. | @stevefdailisan","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/666429255757115392\/Ej4WDiwl_normal.png","user_id":"39453212","id":756085,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmanews\/status\/815412262156439553","location":"Philippines","name":"GMA News","tweet_id":"815412262156439553","date":"2017-01-01T04:20:07"},"whoas":162,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmanews\/status\/815412262156439553","updated_date":"2017-01-01T04:32:15.835584","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gmanews\/status\/815412262156439553","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iqtLsN","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/philippine-authorities-report-4-victims-of-stray","url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","longitude":null,"importance":2,"content":"Philippine authorities report 4 victims of stray bullets, one of which is a 15-year-old girl from Malabon now on life support - GMA News","status":"published","author":{"first_name":"Tom","id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1066710\/","media":null,"ping":null,"topics":[{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=354072","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Malabon<\/b>, officially the <b>City of Malabon<\/b> (Filipino: <span lang=\"fil\"><i>Lungsod ng Malabon<\/i><\/span>), is one of the cities and municipalities that make up Metro Manila in the Philippines.

It consists of about 7,641 islands that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The capital city of the Philippines is Manila and the most populous city is Quezon City, both part of Metro Manila. Bounded by the South China Sea on the west, the Philippine Sea on the east and the Celebes Sea on the southwest, the Philippines shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Palau to the east and Malaysia and Indonesia to the south.<\/p>\n<p>The Philippines' location on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons, but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world's greatest biodiversity. The Philippines has an area of 300,000 square kilometers (115,831 sq mi), and a population of approximately 100 million. It is the seventh-most populated country in Asia and the 12th most populated country in the world. As of 2013, approximately 10 million additional Filipinos lived overseas, comprising one of the world's largest diasporas. Multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, Negritos were some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants. They were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Exchanges with Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Islamic states occurred. Then, various nations were established under the rule of Datus, Rajahs, Sultans or Lakans.<\/p>\n<p>The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan in Homonhon, Eastern Samar in 1521 marked the beginning of Hispanic colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago <i>Las Islas Filipinas<\/i> in honor of Philip II of Spain. With the arrival of Miguel López de Legazpi from Mexico City, in 1565, the first Hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established. The Philippines became part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. This resulted in Roman Catholicism becoming the dominant religion. During this time, Manila became the western hub of the trans-Pacific trade connecting Asia with Acapulco in the Americas using Manila galleons.<\/p>\n<p>As the 19th century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic, followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force. Aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II, when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution.<\/p>\n<p>It is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. It also hosts the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank. The Philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing.<\/p>","id":916,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"philippines","local_url":"\/topic\/philippines\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":259,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-17T00:23:05","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/philippines\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":1,"longitude":120.739067,"name":"Philippines","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=916","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":15.59305,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/916\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":257,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Philippines","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ow","item_count":1719,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:28:48.750554","image_height":256,"geohash":"wdvbeqxkqse8","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/99\/Flag_of_the_Philippines.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_Philippines.svg.png","woeid":23424934,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:32:15.049389","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Philippines\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7306","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>New Year's Day<\/b>, also called simply <b>New Year's<\/b> or <b>New Year<\/b>, is observed on January 1, the first day of the year on the modern Gregorian calendar as well as the Julian calendar.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California.<\/p>\n<p>The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County.<\/p>\n<p>California's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the east; and from the redwood–Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. The Central Valley, a major agricultural area, dominates the state's center.<\/p>\n<p>What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Spanish Empire then claimed it as part of Alta California in their New Spain colony. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta California then was organized as the State of California, and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes, with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom.<\/p>\n<p>If it were a country, California would be the 6th largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous. It is also regarded as a global trendsetter in both popular culture and politics, and is the birthplace of the film industry, the hippie counterculture, the Internet, and the personal computer, among others. Fifty-eight percent of the state's economy is centered on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific and technical business services. The San Francisco Bay Area has the nation's highest median household income by metropolitan area, and is the headquarters of three of the world's largest 20 firms by revenue, Chevron, Apple, and McKesson. Although it accounts for only 1.5 percent of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state.<\/p>","id":549,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"california-us","local_url":"\/topic\/california-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T23:40:34","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/california-us\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":-119.270233,"name":"California, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=549","active":true,"placetype":"State","latitude":37.271881,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/549\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"State","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/California","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/I1","item_count":2719,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:18:17.799654","image_height":341,"geohash":"9qehjcnhx9dp","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/01\/Flag_of_California.svg\/512px-Flag_of_California.svg.png","woeid":2347563,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/California\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=3214","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Idaho<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/aɪ\/ long 'i' in 'tide'\">aɪ<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'h' in 'hi'\">h<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>) is a state in the northwestern region of the United States. It borders the state of Montana to the northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. To the north, it shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia. With a population of around 1.7 million people and an area of 83,569 square miles (216,440 km<sup>2<\/sup>), Idaho is the 14th largest and 39th most populous of the 50 states. The state's capital and largest city is Boise.<\/p>\n<p>Idaho prior to European settlement was inhabited solely by Native American peoples, some of which still live in the area. In the early 19th century, Idaho was considered part of the Oregon Country, an area disputed between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until 1863, instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory. Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd state.<\/p>\n<p>Forming part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated Cascadia bioregion), Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions. In the state's north, the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle is closely linked with Eastern Washington, with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone – the rest of the state uses the Mountain Time Zone. The state's south includes the Snake River Plain (which contains most of the population and agricultural land), while the south-east incorporates part of the Great Basin. Idaho is quite mountainous, and contains several stretches of the Rocky Mountains. Additionally, around 38 percent of Idaho's land is held by the United States Forest Service, the most of any state.<\/p>\n<p>Industries significant for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and tourism. A number of science and technology firms are either headquartered in Idaho or have factories there, and the state also contains the Idaho National Laboratory, which is the largest Department of Energy facility in the country. Idaho's agricultural sector supplies a number of different products, but the state is best known for its potato crop, which comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield. The official state nickname is the \"Gem State\", which references Idaho's reputation for gemstones and, more broadly, its many wilderness areas.<\/p>","id":3214,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"idaho-us","local_url":"\/topic\/idaho-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-05-18T20:00:23","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/idaho-us\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":-114.14328,"name":"Idaho, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3214","active":true,"placetype":"State","latitude":45.494411,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3214\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"State","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idaho","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/z0","item_count":229,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:28:28.116477","image_height":403,"geohash":"c2nffd5856f6","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_Idaho.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Idaho.svg.png","woeid":2347571,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Idaho\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=943","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Oregon<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɔːr\/ 'or' in 'born'\">ɔːr<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ or \/ə\/ 'e' in 'roses'\">ᵻ<\/span><span title=\"'g' in 'guy'\">ɡ<\/span><span title=\"\/ən\/ 'on' in 'button'\">ən<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i><b><span><span>OR<\/span><\/span><\/b>-ə-gən<\/i><\/span>) is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Oregon is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by Washington, on the south by California, on the east by Idaho, and on the southeast by Nevada. The Columbia River delineates much of Oregon's northern boundary, and the Snake River delineates much of the eastern boundary. The parallel 42° north delineates the southern boundary with California and Nevada. It is one of only three states of the contiguous United States to have a coastline on the Pacific Ocean, and its proximity to the ocean heavily influences the state's mild winter climate despite its northern latitude.<\/p>\n<p>Oregon was inhabited by many indigenous tribes before Western traders, explorers, and settlers arrived. An autonomous government was formed in the Oregon Country in 1843 before the Oregon Territory was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state on February 14, 1859. Today, at 98,000 square miles (255,000 km²), Oregon is the ninth largest and, with a population of 4 million, 27th most populous U.S. state. The capital of Oregon is Salem, the second most populous of its cities, with 164,549 residents. Portland is Oregon's most populous city, with 632,309 residents, and ranks as the 26th most populous city in the United States. Portland's metro population of 2,389,228 ranks the 23rd largest metro in the nation. The Willamette Valley in western Oregon is the state's most densely populated area, home to eight of the ten most populous cities.<\/p>\n<p>Oregon's landscape is diverse, with a windswept Pacific coastline; a volcano-studded Cascade Range; abundant bodies of water in and west of the Cascades; dense evergreen, mixed, and deciduous forests at lower elevations; and a high desert sprawling across much of its east all the way to the Great Basin. The tall conifers, mainly Douglas fir, along Oregon's rainy west coast contrast with the lighter-timbered and fire-prone pine and juniper forests covering portions to the east. Abundant alders in the west fix nitrogen for the conifers. Stretching east from central Oregon are semi-arid shrublands, prairies, deserts, steppes, and meadows. At 11,249 feet (3,429 m), Mount Hood is the state's highest point. Oregon's only national park, Crater Lake National Park, comprises the caldera surrounding Crater Lake, the deepest lake in the United States. The state is also home to the single largest organism in the world, <i>Armillaria solidipes<\/i>, a fungus that runs beneath 8.9 km<sup>2<\/sup> (2,200 acres) of the Malheur National Forest.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its diverse landscapes and waterways, Oregon's economy is largely powered by various forms of agriculture, fishing, and hydroelectric power. It is also the top timber-producer of the lower 48 states. Technology is another one of the state's major economic forces, which began in the 1970s with the establishment of the Silicon Forest and the expansion of Tektronix and Intel. Sportswear company Nike, Inc., headquartered in Beaverton, is the state's largest public corporation with an annual revenue of $30.6 billion.<\/p>","id":943,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"oregon-us","local_url":"\/topic\/oregon-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-06-12T23:35:11","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/oregon-us\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":-120.514839,"name":"Oregon, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=943","active":true,"placetype":"State","latitude":44.115589,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/943\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"State","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oregon","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/PN","item_count":571,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:37:02.904625","image_height":307,"geohash":"9rf6cwgxuzyu","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b9\/Flag_of_Oregon.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Oregon.svg.png","woeid":2347596,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oregon\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>U.S.<\/b>) or <b>America<\/b>, is a federal republic composed of <span>‹See TfD›<\/span>50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","id":10,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"united-states","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":8,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","daily_count":14,"recent_count":3,"longitude":-95.845016,"name":"United States","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":37.167931,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":8,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","item_count":28200,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","image_height":269,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","woeid":23424977,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1242","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Washington<\/b> <span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'w' in 'wind'\">w<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ʃ\/ 'sh' in 'shy'\">ʃ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"\/ŋ\/ 'ng' in 'sing'\">ŋ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/ən\/ 'on' in 'button'\">ən<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States located north of Oregon, west of Idaho, and south of the Canadian province of British Columbia on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital. Washington is sometimes referred to as <b>Washington State<\/b> or the <b>State of Washington<\/b> to distinguish it from Washington, D.C., the capital of the U.S., which is often shortened to Washington.<\/p>\n<p>Washington is the 18th largest state with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 sq km), and the 13th most populous state with over 7 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry along the Puget Sound region of the Salish Sea, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west, mountain ranges in the west, central, northeast and far southeast, and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California. Mount Rainier is the state's highest elevation at almost 14,411 feet (4,392 m) and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States.<\/p>\n<p>Washington is a leading lumber producer. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy.<\/p>\n<p>Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has over 1,000 dams, including the Grand Coulee Dam, built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.<\/p>","id":1242,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"washington-us","local_url":"\/topic\/washington-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":233,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-05-14T00:22:25","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/washington-us\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":-120.832718,"name":"Washington, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1242","active":true,"placetype":"State","latitude":47.274319,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1242\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"State","trend_rank_current":231,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Washington_(state)","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/UC","item_count":869,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T02:17:59.870477","image_height":305,"geohash":"c26hfqh0g00z","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/54\/Flag_of_Washington.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Washington.svg.png","woeid":2347606,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Washington_(state)\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7306","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>New Year's Day<\/b>, also called simply <b>New Year's<\/b> or <b>New Year<\/b>, is observed on January 1, the first day of the year on the modern Gregorian calendar as well as the Julian calendar.

Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.<\/p>\n<p>Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 100 °F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.<\/p>\n<p>Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The system is a chaotic system; so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth.

North Korea may also have a chemical weapon and\/or biological weapons capability. Since 2003, North Korea is no longer a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.<\/p>\n<p>On October 9, 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. An underground nuclear explosion was detected, its yield was estimated as less than a kiloton, and some radioactive output was detected.<\/p>\n<p>On January 6, 2007, the North Korean government further confirmed that it had nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>In April 2009, reports surfaced that North Korea has become a \"fully fledged nuclear power\", an opinion shared by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a second nuclear test, resulting in an explosion estimated to be between 2 and 7 kilotons. The 2009 test, like the 2006 test, is believed to have occurred at Mantapsan, Kilju County, in the north-eastern part of North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>On February 11, 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a third underground nuclear test. North Korea has officially reported it as a successful nuclear test with a lighter warhead that delivers more force than before, but has not revealed the exact yield. Multiple South Korean sources estimate the yield at 6–9 kilotons, while the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources estimates the yield at 40 kilotons. However, the German estimates has since revised to a yield equivalent of 14 kt when they published their estimations in 2016 Jan.<\/p>\n<p>On January 6, 2016 in Korea, the United States Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a fourth underground nuclear test. North Korea claimed that this test involved a hydrogen bomb. This claim has not been verified. Within hours, many nations and organizations had condemned the test. Expert U.S. analysts do not believe that a hydrogen bomb was detonated. Seismic data collected so far suggests a 6-9 kiloton yield and that magnitude is not consistent with the power that would be generated by a hydrogen bomb explosion. \"What we're speculating is they tried to do a boosted nuclear device, which is an atomic bomb that has a little bit of hydrogen, an isotope in it called tritium,\" said Joseph Cirincione, president of the global security firm Ploughshares Fund. The German source which estimates for all the North Korea's past nuclear test has instead made an initial estimation of 14 kt, which is about the same (revised) yield as its previous nuclear test in 2013. However the yield estimation for January 2016 nuclear test was revised to 10 kt in the subsequent nuclear test from North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>On February 7, 2016, roughly a month after the alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea claimed to have put a satellite into orbit around the Earth. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had warned the North to not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated Japanese territory, it would be shot down. Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite was purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have criticized the launch, and despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an ICBM test under the guise of a peaceful satellite launch. China also criticized the launch, however urged \"the relevant parties\" to \"refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula\".<\/p>\n<p>A fifth nuclear test occurred on September 9, 2016. This test yield is considered the highest among all five tests thus far, surpassing its previous record in 2013. The South Korean government has been underestimating the test yield for years (Especially the 2013 test, where South Korea Defense Ministry initially suggests a 6 kt to 7 kt yield but has later revised upwards to maximum 9 kt by using the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization’s calculation method when the Chinese academics suggests about 12 kt yield as well as NORSAR estimates the yield to be about 10 kilotons after they have compared the seismic data from all three North Korean nuclear tests.), but has acknowledged that the yield of September 2016 nuclear test is about 10 kt despite other sources suggesting a <span>20 to 30 kt<\/span> yield. The same German source which has made estimation of all North Korea's previous nuclear tests suggested an estimation of a 25 kiloton yield.<\/p>\n<p>Other nations and the United Nations have responded to North Korea's ongoing missile and nuclear development with a variety of sanctions; on March 2, 2016, the UN Security Council voted to impose additional sanctions against North Korea.<\/p>","id":311,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"north-korea-nuclear-program","local_url":"\/topic\/north-korea-nuclear-program\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"off","created_on":"2012-09-28T21:13:47","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-korea-nuclear-program\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":2,"longitude":null,"name":"North Korea nuclear program","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=311","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/311\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"WarConflictEvent","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FB","item_count":703,"kind":"arc","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:09:56.922432","image_height":236,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/31\/Locator_map_of_North_Korea.svg\/512px-Locator_map_of_North_Korea.svg.png","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:18:32.893872","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=14","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>North Korea<\/b> (<span><span><span> <\/span>listen<\/span><\/span>), officially the <b>Democratic People's Republic of Korea<\/b> (<b>DPRK<\/b> <span><span><span> <\/span>listen<\/span><\/span>), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang is both the nation's capital as well as its largest city. To the north and northwest the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in China) and Tumen rivers. The country is bordered to the south by South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea), with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone separating the two.<\/p>\n<p>The earliest human artifacts found in North Korea (Korean pottery) have been dated to 8000 BC. There were three kingdoms flourishing on the peninsula in the 1st century BC. The name <i>Korea<\/i> is derived from the Kingdom of Goguryeo, also spelled as <i>Koryŏ<\/i>, which was one of East Asia's greatest empires. Starting in the 7th century, Korea under the Later Silla and Balhae dynasties enjoyed over a millennium of relative tranquility under these long lasting dynasties, during which time the Hangul script was created by Sejong the Great (in 1446). Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910 until the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, when Korea was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel by the United States and the Soviet Union, with the north occupied by the Soviets and the south by the Americans. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950–53). The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, and no official peace treaty was ever signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991. The DPRK officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state and formally holds elections. Critics regard it as a totalitarian dictatorship. Various outlets have called it Stalinist, particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. International organizations have assessed human rights violations in North Korea as belonging to a category of their own, with no parallel in the contemporary world. The Workers' Party of Korea, led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members.<\/p>\n<p>Over time North Korea has gradually distanced itself from the world communist movement. <i>Juche<\/i>, an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into the constitution as a \"creative application of Marxism–Leninism\" in 1972. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most services such as healthcare, education, housing and food production are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered from a famine that resulted in the deaths of between 0.24 and 3.5 million people, and the country continues to struggle with food production. North Korea follows <i>Songun<\/i>, or \"military-first\" policy. It is the country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the U.S., and India. It possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea is an atheist state with no official religion and where public religion is discouraged.<\/p>","id":14,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"north-korea","local_url":"\/topic\/north-korea\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:51:34","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-korea\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":2,"longitude":127.495216,"name":"North Korea","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=14","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":40.3396,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/14\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/O","item_count":2877,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:08:59.667229","image_height":256,"geohash":"wz4tmpx50y6r","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/51\/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg\/512px-Flag_of_North_Korea.svg.png","woeid":23424865,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:18:32.893872","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>U.S.<\/b>) or <b>America<\/b>, is a federal republic composed of <span>‹See TfD›<\/span>50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered.

It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","id":10,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"united-states","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":8,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","daily_count":14,"recent_count":3,"longitude":-95.845016,"name":"United States","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":37.167931,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":8,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","item_count":28200,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","image_height":269,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","woeid":23424977,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1687","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Kim Jong-un<\/b> (Chosŏn'gŭl: <span lang=\"ko-Hang\">김정은<\/span>; <small>Korean: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ɡ̊im d̥ʑ̥̯̯ʌŋ ɯn]<\/span>; born 8 January 1984) is the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea and supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>Kim is the third and youngest son of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and his consort Ko Yong-hui.

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". <b>Warfare<\/b> refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests which was greater than 41 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.<\/p>","id":15,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"war-conflict","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":17,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":34,"recent_count":8,"longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":17,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","item_count":46131,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:44.507639","image_height":316,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg\/512px-Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Edez","url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","note":null,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Jan 01, 2017, 04:18 AM GMT","latitude":null,"sponsor":null,"pushed":true,"data":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","date":"2017-01-01T04:18:32.893872"},{"source":null,"id":1066692,"type":"text","slug":"rajbinder-singh-brar-known-as-raj-brar-in-the","push_content":"Rajbinder Singh Brar, known as 'Raj Brar' in the Punjabi singing industry, dies at age 47 - Hindustan Times","local_url":"\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/rajbinder-singh-brar-known-as-raj-brar-in-the","tweet":null,"whoas":125,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/punjab\/punjabi-lyricist-singer-raj-brar-dies-at-47\/story-QfIRf7QM5a3NINBoNdDK2H.html","updated_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:29.176642","url":"http:\/\/www.hindustantimes.com\/punjab\/punjabi-lyricist-singer-raj-brar-dies-at-47\/story-QfIRf7QM5a3NINBoNdDK2H.html","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iql3dW","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/rajbinder-singh-brar-known-as-raj-brar-in-the","url_domain":"hindustantimes.com","submitter":"editor","longitude":null,"importance":2,"content":"Rajbinder Singh Brar, known as 'Raj Brar' in the Punjabi singing industry, dies at age 47 - Hindustan Times","status":"published","author":{"first_name":"Tom","id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1066692\/","media":null,"ping":null,"topics":[{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=9946","livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>Punjab<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɑː\/ 'a' in 'father'\">ɑː<\/span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>, <span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɑː\/ 'a' in 'father'\">ɑː<\/span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>, <span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/æ\/ short 'a' in 'bad'\">æ<\/span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>, <span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/æ\/ short 'a' in 'bad'\">æ<\/span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>), also spelled <b>Panjab<\/b>, <i>panj-āb<\/i>, land of \"five rivers\" (Punjabi: <span lang=\"pnb\" xml:lang=\"pnb\"><span title=\"Nastaliq\">پنجاب<\/span><\/span> <small>(Shahmukhi)<b>;<\/b><\/small> <span lang=\"pa\" xml:lang=\"pa\">ਪੰਜਾਬ<\/span> <small>(Gurumukhi))<\/small>, is a geographical and cultural region in the northern part of South Asia, comprising areas of eastern Pakistan and northern India.

The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \"color\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (<i>mousike<\/i>; \"art of the Muses\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \"the harmony of the spheres\" and \"it is music to my ears\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \"There is no noise, only sound.\"<\/p>\n<p>The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as \"not being music\", including Beethoven's <i>Grosse Fuge<\/i> string quartet in 1825, early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s. There are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st centuries.<\/p>\n<p>Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided into subgenres (e.g., country blues and pop country are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal. Within the arts, music may be classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD player, Smartphone or as film score or TV show.<\/p>\n<p>In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or working as a professional musician or singer. The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings and sheet music and scores to customers.<\/p>","id":337,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"music","local_url":"\/topic\/music\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-12-03T23:10:23","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/music\/","daily_count":4,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"music","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=337","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/337\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Subvertical","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Music","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Fb","item_count":3389,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T04:08:58.983634","image_height":321,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9b\/Music_lesson_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2421.jpg\/512px-Music_lesson_Staatliche_Antikensammlungen_2421.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Music\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=374866","livevideo":"","description":"","id":374866,"ping_category":[],"image_width":null,"slug":"rajbinder-singh-brar","local_url":"\/topic\/rajbinder-singh-brar\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2017-01-01T04:09:27.688652","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/rajbinder-singh-brar\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"Rajbinder Singh Brar","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=374866","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/374866\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Person","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BjgO","item_count":1,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":null,"image_height":null,"geohash":"","image_url":"","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","image_credit":""},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Entertainment<\/b> is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","id":75,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"entertainment","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":83,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","daily_count":8,"recent_count":2,"longitude":null,"name":"entertainment","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":83,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","item_count":13941,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","image_height":592,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43347","livevideo":"","description":"<p>An <b>obituary<\/b> (<b>obit<\/b> for short) is a news article that reports the recent death of a person, typically along with an account of the person's life and information about the upcoming funeral.

Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just 305 square miles (790 km<sup>2<\/sup>), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term <i>New York minute<\/i>. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan Statistical Area (20.2 million residents) and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39 trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>New York City traces its origin to its 1624 founding in Lower Manhattan as a trading post by colonists of the Dutch Republic and was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed <i>New York<\/i> after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. New York served as the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790. It has been the country's largest city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the Americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a symbol of the United States and its democracy. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a record of nearly 60 million tourists in 2015, hosting three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world. Times Square, iconic as the world's \"heart\" and its \"Crossroads\", is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. The names of many of the city's bridges, tapered skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Manhattan's Chinatown incorporates the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, with multiple signature Chinatowns developing across the city. Providing continuous 24\/7 service, the New York City Subway is one of the most extensive metro systems worldwide, with 469 stations in operation. Over 120 colleges and universities are located in New York City, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, which have been ranked among the top 35 in the world.<\/p>","id":134,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"new-york-ny-us","local_url":"\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":55,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2013-06-04T15:19:28","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/new-york-ny-us\/","daily_count":8,"recent_count":5,"longitude":-74.007118,"name":"New York, NY, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=134","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":40.71455,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/134\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":55,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CK","item_count":10509,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:33:44.077637","image_height":674,"geohash":"dr5regvetxd9","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9d\/NYC_Montage_2014_4_-_Jleon.jpg\/512px-NYC_Montage_2014_4_-_Jleon.jpg","woeid":2459115,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:10:30.087894","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_York_City\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=9276","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Times Square<\/b> is a major commercial intersection and neighborhood in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and stretching from West 42nd to West 47th Streets.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, straddling the Bosphorus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side. The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province), both hosting a population of around 14.7 million residents. Istanbul is one of the world's most populous cities and ranks as the world's 7th-largest city proper and the largest European city.<\/p>\n<p>Founded under the name of <i>Byzantion<\/i> (Βυζάντιον) on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE, the city developed to become one of the most significant in history. After its reestablishment as <i>Constantinople<\/i> in 330 CE, it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries, during the Roman and Byzantine (330–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires. It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul's strategic position on the historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.<\/p>\n<p>Approximately <span>12.56 million<\/span> foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five years after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the world's fifth most popular tourist destination. The city's biggest attraction is its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's natural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyoğlu district. Considered a global city, Istanbul has one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world. It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion, Istanbul has bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years.<\/p>","id":3515,"ping_category":[],"image_width":502,"slug":"istanbul-istanbul-tr","local_url":"\/topic\/istanbul-istanbul-tr\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-05-31T09:13:40","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/istanbul-istanbul-tr\/","daily_count":23,"recent_count":5,"longitude":28.986179,"name":"Istanbul, İstanbul, Turkey","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3515","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":41.040852,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3515\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/4r","item_count":861,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:31:01.450049","image_height":838,"geohash":"sxk97x70e6m2","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/ba\/Istanbul_collage_5j.jpg","woeid":2344116,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Istanbul\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=477","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Los Angeles<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'s' in 'sigh'\">s<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/æ\/ short 'a' in 'bad'\">æ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ or \/ə\/ 'e' in 'roses'\">ᵻ<\/span><span title=\"'s' in 'sigh'\">s<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>, Spanish for \"The Angels\"), officially the <b>City of Los Angeles<\/b> and often known by its initials <b>L.A.<\/b>, is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over 10,000 feet (3,000 m).<\/p>\n<p>Historically home to the Chumash and Tongva, Los Angeles was claimed by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542 along with the rest of what would become Alta California. The city was officially founded on September 4, 1781, by Spanish governor Felipe de Neve. It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican–American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, thereby becoming part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The city experienced rapid growth with the discovery of oil.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the focal point of the larger Los Angeles metropolitan area and the Greater Los Angeles Area region, which contain 13 million and over 18 million people, respectively, as of 2010, making it one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world as well as the second-largest in the United States and the densest urban area in the United States. Los Angeles is the seat of Los Angeles County, the most populated county in the United States. The city's inhabitants are referred to as Angelenos.<\/p>\n<p>Nicknamed the \"City of Angels\", Los Angeles is a global city with a diverse economy in entertainment, culture, media, fashion, science, sports, technology, education, medicine and research. It has been ranked 6th in the Global Cities Index and 9th in the Global Economic Power Index. The city is home to renowned institutions covering a broad range of professional and cultural fields, and is one of the most substantial economic engines within the United States. The Los Angeles combined statistical area (CSA) has a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $831 billion (as of 2008), making it the third-largest in the world, after the Greater Tokyo and New York metropolitan areas.<\/p>\n<p>Los Angeles includes Hollywood and leads the world in the creation of television productions and recorded music; it is also one of the leaders in motion picture production.<\/p>\n<p>L.A. hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984 and is bidding to host the 2024 Summer Olympics and thus become the second city to have hosted the Games three times (after London). The Los Angeles area also hosted the 1994 FIFA men's soccer World Cup final match as well as the 1999 FIFA women's soccer World Cup final match; both games were held at the Rose Bowl in the nearby town of Pasadena. The men's event was watched on television by over 700 million people worldwide.<\/p>","id":477,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"los-angeles-ca-us","local_url":"\/topic\/los-angeles-ca-us\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":18,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T19:43:53","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/los-angeles-ca-us\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":-118.245003,"name":"Los Angeles, CA, US","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=477","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":34.053501,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/477\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":18,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Angeles","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hr","item_count":5211,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T10:41:54.392809","image_height":342,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/57\/LA_Skyline_Mountains2.jpg\/512px-LA_Skyline_Mountains2.jpg","woeid":2442047,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:53:08.334479","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Los_Angeles\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=23215","livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>Los Angeles Police Department<\/b> (<b>LAPD<\/b>), officially the <b>City of Los Angeles Police Department<\/b>, is the law enforcement agency for the city of Los Angeles, California, United States.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.

It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". <b>Warfare<\/b> refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests which was greater than 41 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.<\/p>","id":15,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"war-conflict","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":17,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":34,"recent_count":8,"longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Topic","trend_rank_current":17,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","item_count":46131,"kind":"vertical","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:44.507639","image_height":316,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg\/512px-Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>"}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Edej","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"data_type":null,"date_ap":"Jan 01, 2017, 03:53 AM GMT","latitude":null,"sponsor":null,"pushed":true,"data":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","date":"2017-01-01T03:53:08.334479"},{"source":null,"id":1066682,"type":"text","slug":"kim-jong-un-north-korea-is-in-the-final-stage","push_content":"Kim Jong-un: North Korea is in the 'final stage' of developing an ICBM - Yonhap","local_url":"\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/kim-jong-un-north-korea-is-in-the-final-stage","tweet":null,"whoas":172,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/english.yonhapnews.co.kr\/news\/2017\/01\/01\/0200000000AEN20170101002300315.html","updated_date":"2017-01-01T03:52:09.730483","url":"http:\/\/english.yonhapnews.co.kr\/news\/2017\/01\/01\/0200000000AEN20170101002300315.html","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iqhmVB","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2017\/01\/01\/kim-jong-un-north-korea-is-in-the-final-stage","url_domain":"yonhapnews.co.kr","submitter":"editor","longitude":null,"importance":3,"content":"Kim Jong-un: North Korea is in the 'final stage' of developing an ICBM - Yonhap","status":"published","author":{"first_name":"Tom","id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1066682\/","media":null,"ping":null,"topics":[{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=311","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>North Korea and weapons of mass destruction<\/b> concerns North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK), which declared in 2009 that it had developed a nuclear weapon, and possessed a small stockpile of relatively simple nuclear weapons. North Korea may also have a chemical weapon and\/or biological weapons capability. Since 2003, North Korea is no longer a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.<\/p>\n<p>On October 9, 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. An underground nuclear explosion was detected, its yield was estimated as less than a kiloton, and some radioactive output was detected.<\/p>\n<p>On January 6, 2007, the North Korean government further confirmed that it had nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>In April 2009, reports surfaced that North Korea has become a \"fully fledged nuclear power\", an opinion shared by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a second nuclear test, resulting in an explosion estimated to be between 2 and 7 kilotons. The 2009 test, like the 2006 test, is believed to have occurred at Mantapsan, Kilju County, in the north-eastern part of North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>On February 11, 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a third underground nuclear test. North Korea has officially reported it as a successful nuclear test with a lighter warhead that delivers more force than before, but has not revealed the exact yield. Multiple South Korean sources estimate the yield at 6–9 kilotons, while the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources estimates the yield at 40 kilotons. However, the German estimates has since revised to a yield equivalent of 14 kt when they published their estimations in 2016 Jan.<\/p>\n<p>On January 6, 2016 in Korea, the United States Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a fourth underground nuclear test. North Korea claimed that this test involved a hydrogen bomb. This claim has not been verified. Within hours, many nations and organizations had condemned the test. Expert U.S. analysts do not believe that a hydrogen bomb was detonated. Seismic data collected so far suggests a 6-9 kiloton yield and that magnitude is not consistent with the power that would be generated by a hydrogen bomb explosion. \"What we're speculating is they tried to do a boosted nuclear device, which is an atomic bomb that has a little bit of hydrogen, an isotope in it called tritium,\" said Joseph Cirincione, president of the global security firm Ploughshares Fund. The German source which estimates for all the North Korea's past nuclear test has instead made an initial estimation of 14 kt, which is about the same (revised) yield as its previous nuclear test in 2013. However the yield estimation for January 2016 nuclear test was revised to 10 kt in the subsequent nuclear test from North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>On February 7, 2016, roughly a month after the alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea claimed to have put a satellite into orbit around the Earth. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had warned the North to not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated Japanese territory, it would be shot down. Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite was purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have criticized the launch, and despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an ICBM test under the guise of a peaceful satellite launch. China also criticized the launch, however urged \"the relevant parties\" to \"refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula\".<\/p>\n<p>A fifth nuclear test occurred on September 9, 2016. This test yield is considered the highest among all five tests thus far, surpassing its previous record in 2013. The South Korean government has been underestimating the test yield for years (Especially the 2013 test, where South Korea Defense Ministry initially suggests a 6 kt to 7 kt yield but has later revised upwards to maximum 9 kt by using the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization’s calculation method when the Chinese academics suggests about 12 kt yield as well as NORSAR estimates the yield to be about 10 kilotons after they have compared the seismic data from all three North Korean nuclear tests.), but has acknowledged that the yield of September 2016 nuclear test is about 10 kt despite other sources suggesting a <span>20 to 30 kt<\/span> yield. The same German source which has made estimation of all North Korea's previous nuclear tests suggested an estimation of a 25 kiloton yield.<\/p>\n<p>Other nations and the United Nations have responded to North Korea's ongoing missile and nuclear development with a variety of sanctions; on March 2, 2016, the UN Security Council voted to impose additional sanctions against North Korea.<\/p>","id":311,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"north-korea-nuclear-program","local_url":"\/topic\/north-korea-nuclear-program\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"off","created_on":"2012-09-28T21:13:47","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-korea-nuclear-program\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":2,"longitude":null,"name":"North Korea nuclear program","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=311","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/311\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"WarConflictEvent","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FB","item_count":703,"kind":"arc","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:09:56.922432","image_height":236,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/31\/Locator_map_of_North_Korea.svg\/512px-Locator_map_of_North_Korea.svg.png","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:18:32.893872","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=14","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>North Korea<\/b> (<span><span><span> <\/span>listen<\/span><\/span>), officially the <b>Democratic People's Republic of Korea<\/b> (<b>DPRK<\/b> <span><span><span> <\/span>listen<\/span><\/span>), is a country in East Asia, in the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Pyongyang is both the nation's capital as well as its largest city. To the north and northwest the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok (known as the Yalu in China) and Tumen rivers. The country is bordered to the south by South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea), with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone separating the two.<\/p>\n<p>The earliest human artifacts found in North Korea (Korean pottery) have been dated to 8000 BC. There were three kingdoms flourishing on the peninsula in the 1st century BC. The name <i>Korea<\/i> is derived from the Kingdom of Goguryeo, also spelled as <i>Koryŏ<\/i>, which was one of East Asia's greatest empires. Starting in the 7th century, Korea under the Later Silla and Balhae dynasties enjoyed over a millennium of relative tranquility under these long lasting dynasties, during which time the Hangul script was created by Sejong the Great (in 1446). Korea was annexed by the Empire of Japan in 1910 until the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945, when Korea was divided into two zones along the 38th parallel by the United States and the Soviet Union, with the north occupied by the Soviets and the south by the Americans. Negotiations on reunification failed, and in 1948 two separate governments were formed: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the north, and the Republic of Korea in the south. An invasion initiated by North Korea led to the Korean War (1950–53). The Korean Armistice Agreement brought about a ceasefire, and no official peace treaty was ever signed. Both states were accepted into the United Nations in 1991. The DPRK officially describes itself as a self-reliant socialist state and formally holds elections. Critics regard it as a totalitarian dictatorship. Various outlets have called it Stalinist, particularly noting the elaborate cult of personality around Kim Il-sung and his family. International organizations have assessed human rights violations in North Korea as belonging to a category of their own, with no parallel in the contemporary world. The Workers' Party of Korea, led by a member of the ruling family, holds power in the state and leads the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of which all political officers are required to be members.<\/p>\n<p>Over time North Korea has gradually distanced itself from the world communist movement. <i>Juche<\/i>, an ideology of national self-reliance, was introduced into the constitution as a \"creative application of Marxism–Leninism\" in 1972. The means of production are owned by the state through state-run enterprises and collectivized farms. Most services such as healthcare, education, housing and food production are subsidized or state-funded. From 1994 to 1998, North Korea suffered from a famine that resulted in the deaths of between 0.24 and 3.5 million people, and the country continues to struggle with food production. North Korea follows <i>Songun<\/i>, or \"military-first\" policy. It is the country with the highest number of military and paramilitary personnel, with a total of 9,495,000 active, reserve, and paramilitary personnel. Its active duty army of 1.21 million is the fourth largest in the world, after China, the U.S., and India. It possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea is an atheist state with no official religion and where public religion is discouraged.<\/p>","id":14,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"north-korea","local_url":"\/topic\/north-korea\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:51:34","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-korea\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":2,"longitude":127.495216,"name":"North Korea","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=14","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":40.3396,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/14\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/O","item_count":2877,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:08:59.667229","image_height":256,"geohash":"wz4tmpx50y6r","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/51\/Flag_of_North_Korea.svg\/512px-Flag_of_North_Korea.svg.png","woeid":23424865,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:18:32.893872","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1687","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Kim Jong-un<\/b> (Chosŏn'gŭl: <span lang=\"ko-Hang\">김정은<\/span>; <small>Korean: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ɡ̊im d̥ʑ̥̯̯ʌŋ ɯn]<\/span>; born 8 January 1984) is the Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea and supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly referred to as North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>Kim is the third and youngest son of Kim Jong-il (1941–2011) and his consort Ko Yong-hui.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.<\/p>\n<p>For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages classifiable into roughly 250 groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. By 1942, Australia gained near independence with the passing of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act and achieved full status as an sovereign independent state with the passing of the Australia Act 1986, effectively severing its legal ties with the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories. The population of 24 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.<\/p>\n<p>Australia has the world's 13th-largest economy and ninth-highest per capita income (IMF).

Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with the majority of the metropolitan area of Perth located on the Swan Coastal Plain, a narrow strip between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp, a low coastal escarpment. The first areas settled were on the Swan River, with the city's central business district and port (Fremantle) both located on its shores. The Perth Metropolitan Region includes 30 local government areas, which themselves consist of a large number of suburbs, extending from Two Rocks in the north to Rockingham in the south, and east inland to The Lakes.<\/p>\n<p>Perth was originally founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony. It gained city status (currently vested in the smaller City of Perth) in 1856, and was promoted to the status of a Lord Mayorality in 1929. The city is named after Perth, Scotland, due to the influence of Sir George Murray, Member of Parliament for Perthshire and Secretary of State for War and the Colonies. The city's population increased substantially as a result of the Western Australian gold rushes in the late 19th century, largely as a result of emigration from the eastern colonies of Australia. During Australia's involvement in World War II, Fremantle served as a base for submarines operating in the Pacific Theatre, and a US Navy Catalina flying boat fleet was based at Matilda Bay. An influx of immigrants after the war, predominantly from Britain, Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia, led to rapid population growth. This was followed by a surge in economic activity flowing from several mining booms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that saw Perth become the regional headquarters for a number of large mining operations located around the state.<\/p>\n<p>As part of Perth's role as the capital of Western Australia, the state's Parliament and Supreme Court are located within the city, as is Government House, the residence of the Governor of Western Australia. Perth became known worldwide as the \"City of Light\" when city residents lit their house lights and streetlights as American astronaut John Glenn passed overhead while orbiting the earth on Friendship 7 in 1962. The city repeated the act as Glenn passed overhead on the Space Shuttle in 1998. Perth came 7th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's August 2016 list of the world's most liveable cities, and was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2010 as a world city.<\/p>","id":11550,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"perth-western-australia-au","local_url":"\/topic\/perth-western-australia-au\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-03-02T05:31:43","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/perth-western-australia-au\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":116.007492,"name":"Perth, Western Australia, Australia","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=11550","active":true,"placetype":"Town","latitude":-31.982651,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/11550\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Town","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Perth","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DAS","item_count":237,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:28:24.514548","image_height":524,"geohash":"qd66hrhkrc0d","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/5e\/Free_vector_map_of_Perth_Australia_level_12.svg\/512px-Free_vector_map_of_Perth_Australia_level_12.svg.png","woeid":1098081,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:49:59.170811","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Perth\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5977","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)<\/b>, commonly known as <b>ecstasy<\/b> (<b>E<\/b>), is a psychoactive drug used primarily as a recreational drug. Desired effects include increased empathy, euphoria, and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 30–45 minutes and last 3–6 hours. It is also sometimes snorted or smoked. As of 2016, MDMA has no accepted medical uses.<\/p>\n<p>Adverse effects of MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, teeth grinding, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat. Use may also lead to depression and fatigue. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA increases the release and slows the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in parts of the brain. It has stimulant and psychedelic effects. The initial increase is followed by a short-term decrease in the neurotransmitters. MDMA belongs to the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of drugs.<\/p>\n<p>MDMA was first made in 1912. It was used to improve psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. It is often sold mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2014, between 9 and 29 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.2% to 0.6% of the world population). This was broadly similar to the percentage of people who use cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids, but fewer than for cannabis. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>MDMA is generally illegal in most countries. Limited exceptions are sometimes made for research. Researchers are investigating whether a few low doses of MDMA may assist in treating severe, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More research is needed to determine if its usefulness outweighs the risk of harm. In November 2016, phase 3 clinical trials for PTSD were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to assess effectiveness and safety.<\/p>","id":5977,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"ecstasy","local_url":"\/topic\/ecstasy\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2012-10-05T02:33:06","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ecstasy\/","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"MDMA","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5977","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5977\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"MedicalTreatment","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MDMA","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BiZ","item_count":38,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:58:45.943332","image_height":469,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b0\/MDMA_molecule_from_xtal_ball.png\/512px-MDMA_molecule_from_xtal_ball.png","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:49:59.170811","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MDMA\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7702","livevideo":"","description":"<p>In the Gregorian calendar, <b>New Year's Eve<\/b> (also known as <b>Old Year's Day<\/b> or <b>Saint Sylvester's Day<\/b> in many countries), the last day of the year, is on December 31 which is six days after Christmas Day.

At 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.<\/p>\n<p>Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power as well as a regional power and has been characterised as a potential superpower. It is permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and one of the five members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), along with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.<\/p>","id":87,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"russia","local_url":"\/topic\/russia\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":43,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:11:27","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russia\/","daily_count":7,"recent_count":1,"longitude":108.830719,"name":"Russia","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":59.453751,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/87\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":44,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BZ","item_count":10245,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:38:39.507079","image_height":341,"geohash":"y6t6hx0r6pe7","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/f\/f3\/Flag_of_Russia.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png","woeid":23424936,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>U.S.<\/b>) or <b>America<\/b>, is a federal republic composed of <span>‹See TfD›<\/span>50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","id":10,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"united-states","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":8,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","daily_count":14,"recent_count":3,"longitude":-95.845016,"name":"United States","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","active":true,"placetype":"Country","latitude":37.167931,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Country","trend_rank_current":8,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","item_count":28200,"kind":"location","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","image_height":269,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","woeid":23424977,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43410","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Computer security<\/b>, also known as <b>cyber security<\/b> or <b>IT security<\/b>, is the protection of computer systems from the theft or damage to the hardware, software or the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.<\/p>\n<p>It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.<\/p>\n<p>The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems and the Internet in most societies, wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi – and the growth of \"smart\" devices, including smartphones, televisions and tiny devices as part of the Internet of Things.<\/p>","id":43410,"ping_category":[],"image_width":null,"slug":"security","local_url":"\/topic\/security\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":142,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2013-08-28T14:10:18.313463","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/security\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"cybersecurity","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43410","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43410\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Subvertical","trend_rank_current":141,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Computer_security","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSK","item_count":2153,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:01:51.964674","image_height":null,"geohash":"","image_url":"","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","image_credit":""},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2731","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Donald John Trump<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman and politician who is the President-elect of the United States. He is <i>de facto<\/i> scheduled to take office as the 45th President on <span>January 20<\/span>, 2017, however, the United States Electoral College will still vote on December 19, 2016, decisively declaring either candidate should take office.<\/p>\n<p>Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","id":2731,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"donald-trump","local_url":"\/topic\/donald-trump\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"","created_on":"2010-09-09T20:31:06","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","daily_count":6,"recent_count":1,"longitude":null,"name":"Donald Trump","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2731\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"Person","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/sD","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T15:02:08.249596","image_height":683,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","livevideo":"","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

The Syrian government has since then refused efforts to negotiate with what it describes as armed terrorist groups. The war is being fought by several factions: the Syrian Government and its various supporters, a loose alliance of Sunni Arab rebel groups (including the Free Syrian Army), the majority Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, Salafi jihadist groups (including al-Nusra Front) who often co-operate with the Sunni rebels, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The factions receive substantial support from foreign actors, leading many to label the conflict a proxy war waged by both regional and global powers.<\/p>\n<p>Syrian opposition groups formed the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and seized control of the area surrounding Aleppo and parts of southern Syria. Over time, factions of the Syrian opposition split from their original moderate position to pursue an Islamist vision for Syria, as al-Nusra Front and ISIL. In the north, Syrian government forces largely withdrew to fight the FSA, allowing the Kurdish YPG to move in and proclaim <i>de facto<\/i> autonomy. In 2015 the YPG joined forces with Arab, Assyrian, Armenian and some Turkmen groups, forming the Syrian Democratic Forces, while most Turkmen groups remained with the FSA.<\/p>\n<p>International organizations have accused the Syrian government, ISIL and other opposition forces of severe human rights violations and of many massacres. The conflict has caused a refugee crisis.

North Korea may also have a chemical weapon and\/or biological weapons capability. Since 2003, North Korea is no longer a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.<\/p>\n<p>On October 9, 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. An underground nuclear explosion was detected, its yield was estimated as less than a kiloton, and some radioactive output was detected.<\/p>\n<p>On January 6, 2007, the North Korean government further confirmed that it had nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>In April 2009, reports surfaced that North Korea has become a \"fully fledged nuclear power\", an opinion shared by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a second nuclear test, resulting in an explosion estimated to be between 2 and 7 kilotons. The 2009 test, like the 2006 test, is believed to have occurred at Mantapsan, Kilju County, in the north-eastern part of North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>On February 11, 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a third underground nuclear test. North Korea has officially reported it as a successful nuclear test with a lighter warhead that delivers more force than before, but has not revealed the exact yield. Multiple South Korean sources estimate the yield at 6–9 kilotons, while the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources estimates the yield at 40 kilotons. However, the German estimates has since revised to a yield equivalent of 14 kt when they published their estimations in 2016 Jan.<\/p>\n<p>On January 6, 2016 in Korea, the United States Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a fourth underground nuclear test. North Korea claimed that this test involved a hydrogen bomb. This claim has not been verified. Within hours, many nations and organizations had condemned the test. Expert U.S. analysts do not believe that a hydrogen bomb was detonated. Seismic data collected so far suggests a 6-9 kiloton yield and that magnitude is not consistent with the power that would be generated by a hydrogen bomb explosion. \"What we're speculating is they tried to do a boosted nuclear device, which is an atomic bomb that has a little bit of hydrogen, an isotope in it called tritium,\" said Joseph Cirincione, president of the global security firm Ploughshares Fund. The German source which estimates for all the North Korea's past nuclear test has instead made an initial estimation of 14 kt, which is about the same (revised) yield as its previous nuclear test in 2013. However the yield estimation for January 2016 nuclear test was revised to 10 kt in the subsequent nuclear test from North Korea.<\/p>\n<p>On February 7, 2016, roughly a month after the alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea claimed to have put a satellite into orbit around the Earth. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had warned the North to not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated Japanese territory, it would be shot down. Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket anyway, claiming the satellite was purely intended for peaceful, scientific purposes. Several nations, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, have criticized the launch, and despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an ICBM test under the guise of a peaceful satellite launch. China also criticized the launch, however urged \"the relevant parties\" to \"refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula\".<\/p>\n<p>A fifth nuclear test occurred on September 9, 2016. This test yield is considered the highest among all five tests thus far, surpassing its previous record in 2013. The South Korean government has been underestimating the test yield for years (Especially the 2013 test, where South Korea Defense Ministry initially suggests a 6 kt to 7 kt yield but has later revised upwards to maximum 9 kt by using the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization’s calculation method when the Chinese academics suggests about 12 kt yield as well as NORSAR estimates the yield to be about 10 kilotons after they have compared the seismic data from all three North Korean nuclear tests.), but has acknowledged that the yield of September 2016 nuclear test is about 10 kt despite other sources suggesting a <span>20 to 30 kt<\/span> yield. The same German source which has made estimation of all North Korea's previous nuclear tests suggested an estimation of a 25 kiloton yield.<\/p>\n<p>Other nations and the United Nations have responded to North Korea's ongoing missile and nuclear development with a variety of sanctions; on March 2, 2016, the UN Security Council voted to impose additional sanctions against North Korea.<\/p>","id":311,"ping_category":[],"image_width":512,"slug":"north-korea-nuclear-program","local_url":"\/topic\/north-korea-nuclear-program\/","visible":true,"trend_rank_last":0,"links":"","facebookchat":"off","created_on":"2012-09-28T21:13:47","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-korea-nuclear-program\/","daily_count":2,"recent_count":2,"longitude":null,"name":"North Korea nuclear program","twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=311","active":true,"placetype":"","latitude":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/311\/","muted_by_default":false,"category":"WarConflictEvent","trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FB","item_count":703,"kind":"arc","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T00:09:56.922432","image_height":236,"geohash":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/31\/Locator_map_of_North_Korea.svg\/512px-Locator_map_of_North_Korea.svg.png","woeid":null,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:18:32.893872","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction\">Wikipedia<\/a>"},{"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=373669","livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Carrie Frances Fisher<\/b> (born October 21, 1956) is an American actress and writer.

It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet (64 metres) deep. Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it <i>\"Erige\"<\/i> <i>(\"cat\")<\/i> because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called <i>\"Erie\"<\/i> because of its proximity to the lake.<\/p>\n<p>Situated below Lake Huron, Erie's primary inlet is the Detroit River.
