    <h1>Enron Email Dataset</h1>


    This dataset was collected and prepared by the <a
    href="http://www.ai.sri.com/project/CALO">CALO Project</a> (A
    Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes).  It contains data
    from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, 
    organized into folders.  The corpus contains 
    a total of about 0.5M messages.
    This data was originally <a
    href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/10/14/enron/index_np.html">made
    public, and posted to the web</a>, by the <a
    href="http://www.ferc.gov">Federal Energy Regulatory
    Commission</a> during its investigation.

    <p>
    The email dataset was later purchased by <a
    href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/lpk/lpk.html">Leslie
    Kaelbling</a> at MIT, and turned out to have a number of integrity
    problems.  A number of folks at SRI, notably <a
    href="http://www.ai.sri.com/people/gervasio">Melinda Gervasio</a>,
    worked hard to correct these problems, and it is thanks to them
    (not me) that the dataset is available.  The dataset here does not
    include attachments, and some messages have been deleted "as part
    of a redaction effort due to requests from affected
    employees". Invalid email addresses were converted to something of
    the form user@enron.com whenever possible (i.e., recipient is
    specified in some parse-able format like "Doe, John" or "Mary
    K. Smith") and to no_address@enron.com when no recipient was
    specified.</p>

    <p>I get a number of questions about this corpus each week, which
    I am unable to answer, mostly because they deal with preparation
    issues and such that I just don't know about.  If you ask me a
    question and I don't answer, please don't feel slighted.</b>

      
    <p>I am distributing this dataset as a resource for researchers
    who are interested in improving current email tools, or
    understanding how email is currently used.  This data is valuable;
    to my knowledge it is the only substantial collection of "real"
    email that is public.  The reason other datasets are not public is
    because of privacy concerns. In using this dataset, please be
    sensitive to the privacy of the people involved (and remember that
    many of these people were certainly not involved in any of the
    actions which precipitated the investigation.)

    <ul>
       <li>Prior versions of the dataset</strike> are <b>no longer
	 being distributed.</b>  If you are using the 
         March 2, 2004 Version; the August 21, 2009 Version; 
         or the April 2, 2011 Version this dataset for
	 your work, you are requested to replace it with the newer
	 version of the dataset below, or make
	 the <a href="DELETIONS.txt">the appropriate changes</a> to
	 your local copy. 

       <li><a href="enron_mail_20150507.tgz">May 7, 2015 Version
	 of dataset</a> (about 423Mb, tarred and gzipped).  
	 
    </ul>


    <p>There are also several on-line databases that allow you to
    search the data, at <a
    href="http://www.enronemail.com">Enronemail.com</a>, <a
    href="http://orange.sims.berkeley.edu/~atf/enron/enron.cgi">UCB</a>, and

    <h2>Research uses of the dataset</h2>

    This is a partial and poorly maintained list. If I've left your
    work out, don't take it personally, and feel free to send me a
    pointer and/or description.
