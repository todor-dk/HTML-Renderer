          <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><SPAN class=subhead>MSGTAG works with most popular email programs, including Outlook &amp; Outlook Express</SPAN><BR>The beauty of MSGTAG is that you don't have to change anything about the way you write or send your email. In fact you'll hardly even know it's there - a small icon in your system tray is the only indication that MSGTAG is working quietly in the background. It works with almost all desktop email clients including Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora and Pegasus Mail. </font></p>
</P>
            <P><p><font size="2" face="Arial"><SPAN class=subhead>It's unobtrusive.</SPAN><BR>MSGTAG runs in the background while you send your email as usual. This means that you don't have to write your message into a strange little box, or alter email addresses before you send anything. One of the best things about MSGTAG is that your friends don't need to do anything different either. There are no annoying pop-up windows asking them to send a notification back to you - all they see is a small MSGTAG footer stating that you've been notified of them having received the message. </font></p>
</P>
            <P><p><font size="2" face="Arial"><SPAN class=subhead>It's simple.</SPAN><BR>MSGTAG is a breeze to install, and if you're using one of the more popular email programs it will automatically set itself up with your existing settings. If you're using something else, there is an easy-to-use wizard for setting it up manually. Once installed, you can switch MSGTAG on or off at any time, allowing you to choose whether or not to tag each message.</font></p>
</P>
            <P><p><font size="2" face="Arial"><SPAN class=subhead>It's completely FREE!</SPAN><BR>There are no ads for useless stuff, no annoying banners scrolling past all the time, and we're not going to track your movements - it's genuinely free. </font></p>
</P>
            <P><SPAN class=subhead>So what's in it for us?</SPAN><BR>Our hope is 
            that you will find the free version of MSGTAG so useful that you 
            will tell your friends about it, and choose to upgrade to our more 
            sophisticated products. How do we promote this? To tell you about 
            the upgrade options the MSGTAG server will add a brief note to the 
            end of some of your incoming read notification emails — these are 
            the ones that tell you when a friend has read the email you sent. 
            That's it. No hassles. </P>
            <P>So why not download it, and give MSGTAG a try? <BR><BR><BR>
