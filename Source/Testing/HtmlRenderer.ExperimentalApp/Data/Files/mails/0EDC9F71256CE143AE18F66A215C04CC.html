    <td align="left"><p class="style2">Creating and sending an e-mail message is, in many ways, similar to writing a letter without a stamp. In fact sending an e-mail is much the same as sending a letter. The main difference is that the e-mail is delivered almost instantly, although there can be delays caused by server problems, the fact that a recipient's mail box might be full, and other technical problems that will occur from time to time. This is noted because you absolutely cannot assume that an e-mail message will go through 100% of the time. So, if you want to be sure that the message is received, ask the recipient to write back a short note confirming this receipt. </p>

    <td width="255" align="left"> <p>Essentially all e-mails sent from a Windows-based computer work the same. They require that you have access to an <strong>e-mail server</strong>. In terms of sending, the server's job is to take your message and be sure it gets on the Internet to go to the recipient. Typically the server will also maintain a file of &quot;sent messages&quot; so you have an automatic record of all correspondence. </p></td>

    <td width="255">The first step in sending an e-mail is to <strong>log on to the server</strong>. Your provider screen will present a choice that looks something like this. Depending on your server, you will either fill in your username first or just click on <strong>Go</strong> without having to supply a username. NOTE: There are many different e-mail managements systems available. Your might look very different from this sample. </td>

    <td width="255">Your new message appears. You must fill in the <strong>To</strong> line. Provide the recipient's address (no blank spaces allowed). An e-mail address consists of the username (example: <em>jonesg</em>) followed by the @ sign, followed by the domain name (example: <em>yahoo.com</em>). All three elements must be present for the e-mail to be sent. It is a good idea (but not absolutely necessary) to also fill in the <strong>Subject</strong> line, since that gives your recipient an idea of why you are writing. Your <strong>message</strong> then goes in the blank space. <strong>Cc</strong> sends a copy to another person(s). <strong>Bcc</strong> sends a copy to another person, but hides that fact from the original recipient. </td>
