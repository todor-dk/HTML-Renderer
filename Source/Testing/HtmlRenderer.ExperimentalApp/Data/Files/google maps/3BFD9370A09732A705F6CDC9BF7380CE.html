In addition to providing a detailed mapped image of the entire world, the service is also capable of providing directions to any destination and can even calculate the shortest or the least expensive travel route. Google Maps is also a constantly evolving application, and users are able to provide suggestions, make corrections, and even design 3D structures for the Google Maps extension known as Google Earth. Finally, the service can be used at no cost by general users, and Google has actually gone as far as offering free access to the Google Maps API. However, there are also several enterprise solutions available, designed specifically for business-oriented applications.</p><p><strong>Early Days of Google Maps</strong><br>Even though Google Maps has become one of the staple products of Google, the original idea and the computational foundation of the service was first developed by two brothers from Denmark: Lars and Jens Rasmussen. However, the mapping application conceived by the Rasmussen brothers at their start-up Where 2 Technologies was to be distributed as a piece of downloadable software. In 2004, after trying to create various mapping systems from scratch, Google began to show real interest in the brother's project. In 2004, after discussions with the company's technical and marketing staff, Lars and Jens Rasmussen made two very important decisions: to sell their Where 2 Technologies start-up to Google Inc. and become Google project managers, and to revamp their software application into an interactive online service called Google Maps. </p><p>Google Maps can be created with a simple application on our website. It simply requires that you enter the address of the location and click on the button to generate the link. When the process is complete, the link can be copied and pasted into the website. This process is helpful for all types of websites including projects that incorporate storytelling with maps. Here are some tips that you should know:</p><p><strong>1. Google Maps Integrate Satellite Imagery</strong><br>Google Maps also incorporates the use of satellite imagery to provide users with greater detail of the area. The street view is amazingly accurate and precise. This was made possible by Google's vans that acquire information by driving roads and also by acquiring panoramic photos. Users can get maps of and driving directions to almost any location around the world. </p><p><strong>2. Expand Map Functionality with APIs</strong><br>Google will make its Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs) available for free to the public. This expands the functionality of the maps and allows users to embed the information into a website easily. Google Earth API embeds the three-dimensional digital globe into the web page. These webpages can be marked with location pins or marked with images. Directions, elevations, time zones, and distances can also be embedded in maps. </p><p><strong>3. Google Maps Integrated User Reviews</strong><br>The goal of Google Maps is to give users the most functionality.The maps can be used on mobile phones and also on tablets. The user reviews are integrated into the local map views, and users can quickly get information and opinions about local hotels and restaurants.</p><p><strong>4. Plan Routes with Commercial Airline Data</strong><br>If you want to know more about planning a route with the commercial airlines, you can also use Google Maps. This application will provide access to schedules and daily itineraries using train and routes. User thumbnails are included to give pictorial information from each of Google's Photo Tours. </p><p><strong>5. Google Maps Offers Accurate Driving Directions</strong><br>Users can save and print the directions. Step-by-step instructions makes it easier to travel from one destination to another. Most drivers love text messages because it's easier to read everything right on the device. </p></div><div class="col-right"><p><strong>Google Maps is the Way To Go</strong><br>If you want directions, you should use Google Maps. This is one of the most convenient ways to get your directions and read them while on-the-go. You don't have to print them out. You can simply store them on the phone and pull the directions up when you travel. It's a recommended way to travel. Try the new Google Maps application. You'll be happy you did!</p><p><strong>Why to Embed Google Map on Your Site</strong><br>If you have ever been trying to figure out how to get from one place to another, you have probably used Map. You can punch in your starting destination and your ending destination and get a trip route, complete with directions. If you just want to look up a location, you can use the Map to look at the street view, giving you an interactive image of exactly what you will see from the street, when you get there, so that you know what to expect.</p><p>However, this is far from all that you can do with Maps. You can also embed a map on your website so that visitors can see it. This is going to look like an image at first, but people can click on it and move it around, and then they will realize that it is generated by Google Maps. It is far more than a simple image. This can be done on almost any type of website, so the real question is this: How can having one of these interactive images from Google Maps help your site?</p><p>First of all, it can be hugely beneficial because it is far more useful than just writing down your address. Even though the local streets are very familiar to you, your site's visitors do not know anything about them. Just putting down the name and building number does not tell them much about where you are really located, which is what they are wondering if they are trying to find your store or your business. By using an image from Google Map, you allow them to scroll around and look for familiar roads, or they can look at the street view and really get a feel for where your building is located. This provides the accurate information that these people are looking for.</p><p>Another benefit of using the image from Google Map is that people can use it to get directions right to your front door. They can just put in their own address, with yours already set as a waypoint, and the map will tell them how to get there in seconds. This can help you because people will not have to call you for more information; the embedded Google Map can handle all of that for you.</p><p>At the end of the day, what the embedded Google Map are giving people who visit your site is convenience. You are making it easier for them to learn what they need to learn and to get to your physical location. You are taking steps out of the process that they would have needed to take on their own, and that can increase business and customer satisfaction. </p>map-embed.com is a free tool for webmasters &copy; 2013-2016 <br> <a href="wordpress-themes/">Wordpress Themes</a>  <a href="add-facebook-like-button/">Add Facebook Like Button</a>  </div></div></div>
