		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Does your husband swap one wife for another when he leaves you for work in the morning?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Nearly half of all professionals in the UK have or wish they had a ‘work spouse’, according to a 2016 survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A work spouse is a co-worker, usually of the opposite sex (or same sex if you’re gay), that you have a special relationship with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s platonic so there’s no sexual intimacy but it’s so close, it mimics marriage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Whether you’re threatened or merely amused by this relationship, chances are your partner’s having one – even if he isn’t aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A staggering 71.5 per cent of those surveyed said they thought a lot of people already had a ‘work wife’ or ‘work husband’ without realising it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The number of work wives and husbands are on the rise</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And it’s having a big impact on our real marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We work differently now: offices are more team orientated and it’s unusual for those teams to be divided into ‘men’ and ‘women’ so both sexes work closely together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Seventy per cent of employees say having friends at work is the most crucial part of a happy working life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Having a work spouse means you’ve got a cheerleader when work is tough, a sounding block, someone to go to if you get awful news and someone to talk to if you have problems at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We spend more time at work than anywhere else and often stay connected even when we aren’t there through email, text and social media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Consequently, we sometimes know our work colleagues better than our partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When you’re with someone for eight hours every day, five days a week, you know the ‘real’ person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You’ve seen how they perform under stress, how they respond when bawled out by the boss, how generous they are to others (not just how much they put in the kitty for birthdays but whether they give credit to others for work projects).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is what makes work ‘marriages’ so special: this person has seen you at your best and at your worst. They accept you, flaws and all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And that’s why they are so dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Men are often more honest with their work wives</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Studies show couples who say they are loved ‘warts and all’ by their partner are much happier and committed to those who think their partner puts them on a pedestal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Being adored is wonderful but being accepted as you are is the truest compliment of all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“I’m much more likely to admit to doing something stupid to Lucy, my work wife, because I want my real wife to see me at my best,” says James, who has worked with Lucy for six years and spends nearly every lunch hour with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“I don’t like showing vulnerabilities to my real wife in case it makes her respect me less.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lots of men think they’re doing the right thing saving the ‘best’ of themselves for their romantic partner but it destroys relationships rather than nurtures them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>We are closest to the people who know the most about us. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If your partner is chatting intimately about his life more to his work wife than you, your relationship is in danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I’ve witnessed more than one relationship break up because of confidences shared that shouldn’t have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One particular couple were going through a tortuous IVF experience. The husband refused to talk about how he felt about the numerous miscarriages to his wife – but had no problems talking to his work wife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">His real wife found out through another friend that he’d been crying on the shoulder of a friend at work who’d “got him through it all”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Those were his actual words,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“I was furious and confronted him about it and he was genuinely perplexed as to why I was upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“He said he thought I was going through enough without him off loading his emotions on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">She found it such an emotional betrayal, the relationship didn’t recover and they split a few months later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Sharing with a third person has an impact</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even if he’s talking about intimate things with <em>both</em> of you, sharing with a third person outside your relationship still has impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Having a work wife who is on your side can have a hugely positive effect on your relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I counselled a couple where the woman had big jealousy issues that – ironically - disappeared when she dated a man who had a work wife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">She met her work equivalent and saw there wasn’t sexual chemistry but there was respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“I feel like she’ll keep Dan on the straight and narrow if ever he is tempted by anyone else,” she told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“If we can’t solve an argument, I tell him to talk to her to see what she thinks. She’s great at making him see the female perspective and that I’m not being outrageous in what I want from him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But if his work wife sides with him when you’re fighting about something, winding him up rather than calming him down, it hardly helps you work things out when he arrives home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s the emotional closeness that’s threatening – and that can swiftly morph into romantic dependence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Familiarity breeds lust and love</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most work spouse relationships start out innocently: most people never expect it to turn into an affair or romantic relationship and are devastated if that does happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But it’s easy to see <em>how</em> it does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You initially make friends because you have a similar sense of humour, outlook on life and personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You watch each other’s back at work and trust grows, you become reliant on each other’s opinion, realise just how much you miss them if they’re off work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even if you don’t feel physically attracted at the start, research consistently shows the more time we spend with someone, the more we are attracted to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This doesn’t mean all work spouse relationships are dangerous but it does mean it’s more probable there will be some sort of ‘moment’ when one or both will be tempted to cross the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If your partner ends up snogging some random girl while drunk in a nightclub on a stag do, it’s a horrible betrayal but one that’s unlikely to go anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A kiss with his work wife is a life changing moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They already have a solid relationship base. Add a kiss or ‘moment’ when it’s clear they’re viewing each other sexually rather than platonically (and like what they see) and the work marriage suddenly turns into a real one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Just like real marriage, work marriage doesn’t always run smoothly</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even if the relationship doesn’t become romantic, there are still problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The real spouse often feels shut out and jealous of the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The private jokes, the intimacy between them…hearing your husband laughing and chatting away to someone far more easily than they chat to you, is not a nice feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Work colleagues may also feel sidelined by the two of you being so chummy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you fall out with a partner, you dump them and they’re out of your life (or at least mostly out of it, if you have kids).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fall out with your work spouse and it’s not so easy to get rid of them. You’re forced to continue to work, awkwardly, together which makes the whole office tense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">People often develop romantic feelings for platonic friends over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If one of you falls for the other and it’s not reciprocated, every day of work is agony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You’re forced to pretend all you feel is friendship when every part of you longs to be with them; if you’re on the other side and it’s obvious they’ve fallen for you, it’s horrible watching them hurting and knowing you’ve caused it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you both fall for each other and are already involved or married, professionally and personally you’re headed for a highly stressful time with bosses, other work mates and family and friends judging you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I’m all for friendships between men and women and have several close male friends myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But you do need to set boundaries and getting so close that you call a work colleague a ‘wife’ or ‘husband’ can be asking for trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>THREE WAYS TO TELL THERE’S SOMETHING DODGY GOING ON</strong></span></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13pt;">He doesn’t want you to meet his work wife.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The first and most obvious reason is he doesn’t want you to see how attractive she is or that they have chemistry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Another is that he’s ashamed of you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A third is that he’s different with his work wife and knows you’ll notice (if he fancies her, he’ll be on best behaviour).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Another reason is that he’s hoping it will lead to love or sex and knows her seeing you will make her feel guilty taking it further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A wife at home is a concept, a wife in the flesh makes his marriage real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If he happily agrees for you to meet up, that’s a solid sign there’s usually nothing to worry about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">On his part anyway...</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13pt;">How warm is she to you when you meet?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If it’s a genuine, platonic friendship, she’ll be dying to meet you for one good reason alone: she’ll know it will reassure you it is just friendship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Trust your instincts. If she’s friendly and nice and you instantly feel part of their work twosome, put another big tick in the ‘just friends’ box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If she’s offhand and cool, pay attention.</span></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13pt;">Does he lie about how much time they spend together?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you find out your partner is seeing his work wife socially, outside of work hours, and hasn’t been telling you, it’s a definite red flag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If there’s nothing going on, why would he hide seeing her? If it’s because you’re getting jealous of how close they are and how much time he spends with her, seeing her behind your back means he’d rather keep himself (and her) happy than you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>If you’re worried about your own relationship with a work spouse</strong> and you don’t want to put your relationship at risk, answer this question honestly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you were single, would you go out with your work spouse? If the answer is a genuine no for both of you, you’re fine.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s a disturbingly familiar sight: a wealthy, high-achieving, good-looking woman paired up with a less than desirable man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A man who’s not half as attractive or successful, someone who cheats and treats her badly or is so dull, you lose the will to live after five minutes of sitting next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Why did she choose him? She could have done so much better” is everyone’s immediate reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Except hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There are many reasons why successful, smart women make poor choices in partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here are some of them:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Successful women have less choice not more</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ever noticed how all the great men are always taken but all the great women are single?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The more successful you are and the better looking you are as a woman, the harder it is to find a partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s the complete reverse for men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Society has always rewarded men for business and money-making skills and women for beauty and it remains the same despite women fighting hard for equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A high-flying man is seen as a catch. A high-flying women might be admired but she’s also threatening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most men don’t feel ‘good enough’ to approach her and assume they’ll be rejected, so don’t even try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is why all the smart, successful, good-looking women you know are single and your more average looking and achieving friends are in relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Men might drool over pictures of supermodels but it’s Ms Average most will seek out for a relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Read virtually any profile of an A-list female celebrity and they’ll admit that men never ask them out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jennifer Lawrence, Kylie Minogue, Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron, Sandra Bullock, Halle Berry – some of the world’s most beautiful and successful women have all complained of never being approached by men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And all have made atrocious love choices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">High achieving women are asked out and chatted up less often - so are far more flattered when it does happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Starved of love and sex, they’ll grab onto the first guy who approaches them, often making hideous choices because it’s usually the sleazy ‘womaniser’ who has the arrogance and guts to take a punt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Any man looks good if you haven’t had a cuddle or sex for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>High-flying women don’t have time for relationships</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The most precious commodity for a high-flying, successful woman is time: it’s what successful women have the least of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Forming good relationships takes time and focus and most of that is directed towards their careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Smart women often settle for second (third) best simply because they haven’t the time or energy to look for someone better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Any guy who is half decent and wants a serious relationship soon realizes he can’t compete with her career and fades away. Most of the time she barely notices he’s gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The busier you are, the less likely you are to spot the red flags.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s career first, relationship second for most smart, successful women: they pay less attention to what’s going on with partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You start to get glimpses of ‘red flags’ around three months into a relationship – this is the time to pay the most attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s when the best behavior stops and you get a sense of the real, flawed person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Successful women often miss the ‘you’ve hooked up with a loser’ warning signs because they’re too busy and less invested in the relationship than other women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We see what we want to see at the start of new love, not what’s really there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The busier you are, the more guilty you are of this common mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is also the reason behind why successful women don’t get rid of bad men when they do see their true colours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It takes time and energy to split up with someone and new relationships take even more effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If your career is draining everything you have, it’s sometimes worth turning a blind eye to get the rewards of a nice, warm body in the bed at night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They don’t have time to fix the problem</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you acknowledge your partner is treating you badly, you have to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Doing something about it means arguments, long discussions, therapy – none of which she has time for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While others look in and shake their heads and ‘tut tut’, she’s too busy running a business, jetting about the world, making deals and worrying about staff to notice an errant boyfriend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If she does notice, she knows everyone perceives her to be strong and expects her to dump the b*****d, but sometimes a rubbish partner is better than none at all because…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>It’s lonely at the top</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You have to be tough to make it big – especially as a woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s hard work being fearless and feisty and to always have to appear strong – just ask Katy Perry who recently said ‘I’m really strong as Katy Perry, and sometimes I’m not as strong as Katheryn Hudson (her real name)”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We perceive smart, successful women as not needing someone to look after them because they’re so capable of looking after themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But you don’t become a robot just because you’re successful: it’s human to be vulnerable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We all need hugs and kisses and to be feel safe enough to able to show weakness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is why…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The real attraction isn’t always obvious to others</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You’ll often see confident, bright women who rate a 9 or 10 on the attractiveness scale with men who hover around the 3 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But that’s the rest of the world looking in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To her, the ‘three man’ might well be a 10 because of attributes that aren’t as obvious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A man who is kind, supportive and let’s them truly relax and drop all their defenses is worth more to a woman at the top of her game than a wealthy, handsome banker boy who is time poor and emotionally unavailable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lots of successful women want their man to be ‘a wife’ and perform the nurturing, support role women traditionally do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Others choose powerful partners that will help to further or enhance their career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Beyonce and Jay Z are top of the ‘power couple’ list, one reason perhaps why she forgave his dalliance with ‘Becky with the good hair’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The phenomenal success of Brand Beckham may well be why Victoria appears to turn a blind eye to husband David’s rumoured indiscretions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It might look like a silly choice to outsiders but, to her, it makes sense.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ever been with someone who seemed totally in love with you and then did a runner at the last moment?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Chances are you’d hooked up with a commitment phobe: someone who has a fear of intimacy and commitment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Commitment phobes find it difficult, if not impossible, to take relationships onto that ‘sign here’ stage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Which is why no sane person wants to end up falling in love with one – and YOU need to know how to spot one.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s already too late? Skip to the final section for what to do next.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>HOW TO SPOT A COMMITMENT PHOBE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They’ve had a bad experience in the past.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Commitment phobics are terrified of being hurt - look at their past and you’ll usually find the reason why they’ve ended up that way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They’ve been married or in a long-term relationship that ended badly. One parent died or their parents divorced and they saw the fall-out. Even worse, their parents are together but utterly miserable or venomous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Inevitably, their experience of relationships isn’t ideal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If all <em>you’d</em> seen was people hurting each other, you wouldn’t be too keen to put yourself in that situation either.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They’ve had lots of short-term relationships.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Running away around the three month or three year point is quite common (the time when most couples make small or big commitments).</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Also look at who they’ve dated: are they ‘unavailable’ people (married people, workaholics, live in another country)? It’s easy to commit to someone who can’t commit to you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They like to be in control.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If your partner hates being told what to do, watch out. Commitment phobes often become really defensive and argumentative if you take control of a situation because <em>they</em> like being the ones in control.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If they’re in control, they can control their emotions and they can’t get hurt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They blow hot and cold</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Commitment phobes are usually ultra charming to begin with, then, once they’ve won you over, fade away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They love the chase but not the capture: the more serious it gets, the less interested they are.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>You haven’t met each other’s close friends, family or co-workers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Commitment phobes compartmentalise their lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The more people you know that are close to them, the closer you will be to them - and that’s dangerous!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They’re irresponsible.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Commitment phobes have problems committing to <em>anything</em>, not just relationships.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They’re the people who are always late because they resent having to be somewhere at a certain time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s the same with money. They don’t pay bills until they’re sent threatening letters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If their life seems chaotic, this could be why.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>They don’t like making any plans.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Whether it’s taking out a mortgage or contributing to the deposit for a group holiday with friends, they just can’t bring themselves to say, ‘I do.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like most things, there’s a sliding scale with commitment phobia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some people can’t commit to seeing you tomorrow, others are fine right up until the crucial last minute.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong> They don’t share intimate details about themselves.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Be on high alert if they cover up their feelings and don’t show affection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If they tell you intimate things about themselves, they’ve given you the power to hurt them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Commitment phobes don’t like showing vulnerability: the more you see under the surface, they more power you have over them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Their needs come first</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They’re so busy protecting themselves, they ignore your emotional needs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong> They panic when you mention the ‘c’ word</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">C-o-m-m-i-t-m-e-n-t.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Spell it out nice and slow for them as you mention the other two no-nos – the ‘l’ word and the ‘m’ word (living together <em>or</em> marriage) – and watch their reaction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Or simply say something like ‘My best friend’s getting married this weekend. Would you like to come to the wedding with me?’</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The true commitment phobe will find this threatening on so many levels, they’ll instantly invent an excuse, change the topic or disappear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>WHAT TO DO IF YOU’RE ALREADY INVOLVED WITH A COMMITMENT PHOBE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Check you’re not pushing too soon</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">People who simply need time to make big decisions aren’t commitment phobes. They’re sensible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Is your request for commitment timely? Check with a trusted friend.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Be realistic</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You can’t get someone to commit to you if they don’t want to.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If they don’t like being a commitment phobe and are willing to get help (either professional or with you gently guiding them), take a punt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re the only one that sees a problem, walk away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Point out there is never going to be a 100 per cent guarantee.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We live in a very uncertain world, we’re never 100 per cent sure of anything 100 per cent of the time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So if your partner’s waiting for some divine being to come down and say, ‘Look. Let me reassure you this person’s definitely the one for you and they won’t hurt you,’ point out it’s not going to happen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">None of us knows what the future holds; all you can do is make a sensible choice and put all you’ve got into making it work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Let them know anyone who loves, makes themselves vulnerable. You’re <em>both</em> taking a chance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Point out people they or you know who’ve split up and are now happy again: they will survive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Don’t change to accommodate them</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They either want you or they don’t.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Changing your commitment needs – like deciding you don’t need to move in/get married/have a boyfriend or girlfriend who actually turns up to family do’s – won’t make them stay and will make you unhappy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Take it slow</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A lot of commitment phobes get over their fears once they find someone who gives them time to get used to being part of a couple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But think twice before you let yourself fall in love with a long-term sufferer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If they’re over 40 and have never, ever settled down for more than a few months, it’s going to take a lot of hard work to overcome their disil­lusionment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Personally, I’d cut my losses.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here’s a question for you: What do you think is the biggest and most damaging myth about sex that’s not just alive and kicking but looking like it’s <em>never</em> going away?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">How about the fact that most women don’t orgasm through intercourse and only 30% can do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like all sex educators, I’ve been harping on about this for years so am very pleased to see there’s a new book that tackles the topic head on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Becoming-Cliterate-Orgasm-Equality-Matters/dp/0062484389/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497024315&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=becoming+cliterate"><em>‘Becoming Cliterate’</em> </a>challenges our culture’s flawed way of thinking about sex because – as author Dr Laurie Mintz puts it – “it’s screwing with women’s orgasms”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dr Mintz, a US psychology professor and human sexuality expert, thinks we’ve separated our most reliable route to female orgasm – clitoral stimulation – from how we feel we <em>should</em> orgasm – penetration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The result is men have at least three times as many orgasms with a partner than women do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The rates for casual sex are even more abysmal: only four percent of women have orgasms through casual sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“We’ve never – at any point in Western history – had a time where the majority of the population valued women’s way of orgasm as equal to a man’s,” says Dr Mintz. “It’s time to change history”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It IS time to change history – so let’s get started here with some practical tips guaranteed to even the orgasm score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Speak up and stop faking</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’ve been faking it, come clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If we all stop faking orgasms and sabotaging our sex lives, we might just start having one with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Studies show men actually <em>prefer </em>to be told what to do and don’t mind doing it for a reasonable period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">During intercourse, be very specific about what you need – his fingers, a vibrator, a certain style of thrusting – and tell him how long you need it done for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Take control</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The more sexually educated, experienced and assertive the woman is, the more control she takes and fuss she makes to get everything just right during intercourse, the more likely she is to be having real intercourse orgasms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re sexually uneducated and passively lie back while he thrusts in the usual manner, those moans are more likely from frustration than frenzied passion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The more sexually insecure you are, the more likely it is you’ll fake an intercourse orgasm, believing the only reason you’re not having one is because there’s something wrong with you – or him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>It’s anatomy and physiology that makes intercourse orgasms difficult.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dr Mintz says the most striking thing about female masturbation is how likely it is to produce orgasm and how little it resembles, mechanically, the stimulation received from intercourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is why the single, most important thing you can do to even up the tally is to give yourself the same clitoral stimulation you use when pleasuring yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This basically involves thinking of his penis and pelvis as more of a masturbatory tool – something to rub and stimulate your clitoris with and against – than an appendage that thrusts (ineffectively, if pleasantly) in and out of your vagina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sounds selfish? Sorry to be blunt but who cares?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He won’t - he’ll end up climaxing one way or another, believe me! And for once in your life, you might too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Act like a man</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Another great book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Female-Orgasm-Extraordinary-Guide/dp/1569242763/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1497017026&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=i+love+female+orgasm"><em>I Love Female Orgasm</em></a> (Dorian Solot and Marshall Miller) advocates women acting more like men in bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Men don’t lie back waiting hopefully for their partners to give them an orgasm during intercourse, they do whatever it takes to get them there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They’ll thrust in a certain way, rhythm, angle or speed, do it in their favourite position, make sure they have the right fantasies they need playing in their heads and are looking at what they want to see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Guys make it clear that they expect to have lots of sexual pleasure, and an orgasm, and they assume the sexual interlude will continue until they do,” Dorian says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s up to you to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Think about what you need. What position, technique, pressure and pace, what head-space you need to be in, any ‘extra’s’ (stimulation elsewhere) you need, then <em>go for it!</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Don’t just be active, be proactive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Think ‘<em>How do I put pressure on the clitoris’</em> and do whatever it takes to do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When he’s on top, grab his buttocks and pull him close to you, massaging so his pelvis grinds into yours providing clitoral pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Or act like a lesbian</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Women have more orgasms when they have sex with other women than when they have sex with men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Think that’s because you both have the same bits, so know exactly how best to stimulate them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wrong again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s more about women knowing clitoral stimulation is individual and it’s not a case of one technique suits all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Lesbians have a higher orgasm rate because having a clitoris teaches you that it’s important to ask a partner just how <em>hers</em> needs to be stimulated,” says Dr Mintz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Take as long as it takes</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It takes women around four minutes to masturbate to orgasm solo. It takes an average of 20 minutes (and anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes) with a partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dr Mintz cites reputable research that says if a partner spends 20 or more minutes on clitoral stimulation, about 92 per cent of women will orgasm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As US sex therapist <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ian-Kerner/e/B001H6Q1PO/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1497024266&amp;sr=8-2-ent">Ian Kerner </a>(author of <em>She Comes First</em>) says, “that’s a shift of tectonic proportions”: from two out of three women NOT being able to reach climax to nine out of ten having an orgasm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">All because of a few more minutes spent stimulating the clitoris!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Add a vibrator</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s the simplest and least awkward way to add clitoral stimulation to any intercourse position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Choose a mid-size vibrator that’s not so large it’s intrusive but not so small it slips out of your or his hands during the crucial moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Then simply hold and press or roll the fleshy pubic bone or around the clitoral area during penetration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There are vibes you can wear during intercourse (like the <strong>We Vibe</strong>) and vibrating rings that fit around his penis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Learn from the minority</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So what of the 30% hands-free girls - the ones who genuinely do seem to orgasm through intercourse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some believe they’re having penetration orgasms through internal stimulation of the inner erectile tissue and urethral sponge (the ‘G-spot’). Lots, by the way, argue this tissue is effectively still part of the internal clitoral structure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Others say they’re only able to do it because they’re using girl-friendly pelvic grinding that tugs the clitoral hood or puts pressure directly on the clitoris. This is backed up by research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Slow everything down during intercourse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Focus on squeezing your pelvic floor muscles and maintaining control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Go too fast or let him take over and there will be an orgasm – his.</span></p>

Here’s why women no longer fall for men who ‘treat them mean to keep them keen’ </a></h3>
		
		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Finally – research reveals what most sane women already know: nice guys get laid more often than bad boys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A recent UK study found people who help others are more desirable to the opposite sex, have more sexual partners and more frequent sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The study, published in the <em>British Journal of Psychology</em>, asked 800 people about their personality type and their sexual history to see if there was a correlation between the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Exploding the ‘treat them mean, keep them keen’ myth, researchers found selfish people scored poorly when it came to love and sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">People who are altruistic - likely to do things like charity work, give blood, help others – had much more success with both sex and love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The researchers believe altruism has evolved to become a highly desirable human trait because it helps us survive as a species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The bad guy might look hot but he’s not likely to stick around to help look after babies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The death of the myth that most women want bad boys is long overdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘Bad’ people are fabulous if you’re looking for a holiday romance or quick sex fling and want to try out a totally out there sex fantasy and don’t want to be judged for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But who in their right mind would actively seek out a ‘bad boy’ (the clue’s in the name) for a serious relationship unless you have desperately low self-esteem, a ‘victim’ mentality and serious issues going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here’s just a few reasons why nice men are both nicer and sexier – and always have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice men like sex just as much as bad boys</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Just because he’s nice, doesn’t mean he’s a saint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A US study of 500 college students found people who were rated as ‘nice’ had more marital sex, long-term relationship sex AND casual sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Asked to answer if they’d give all or part of a lottery win to charity, those who said yes had much more sex than those who said they’d keep it themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice doesn’t mean weak</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The stereotype that nice equals weak is false.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Studies show nice people are not necessarily less assertive or competitive than ‘difficult’ people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Psychologists define nice people as those who score high on a personality trait called agreeableness: your over-riding concern is having happy, positive relationships with other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You like harmony and you don’t like knowing people are upset (either with you or others).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Studies show agreeable people stay married longer, are more intimate in their marriages, have better relationships with their kids and - not surprisingly - are more satisfied with their lives overall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Case closed for any female who has even a hint of intelligence and high self-esteem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice guys aren’t boring. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Don’t mistake drama for love. Rollercoaster highs and lows aren’t passion, they’re a sign of incompatibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Calm is good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Look at how it ended for poor old Cathy with Heathcliff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice men are confident not cocky</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There’s a huge difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Arrogant men consider themselves better than you and treat you accordingly – like their servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Nice men are liked because they’re nice, so their confidence gets built for all the right reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Nice men don’t need to blow trumpets to announce their arrival, they’re content to let a quieter confidence waft your way and win you over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Think Obama and Trump: strong but understated is a hell of a lot sexier than brash and show off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice men aren’t just funny, they find you funny as well</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Research did (sadly) prove that men find women who find <em>them</em> funny more attractive than funny women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This reeks of self-doubt to me – and any other woman who’s cracked a joke and had their partner laugh appreciatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The nicer the guy, the more comfortable he is with women being ‘better’ than him and the more fun you’ll have together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice men are available</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The very definition of a nice guy is that he’s not duplicitous and is emotionally available: if he says he’s single, he is single.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When bad guys say, ‘There’s no-one special,’ they’re not lying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Their wife/girlfriend/girls they see whenever they fancy a bit aren’t treated like they’re special in the slightest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Why would you want to add your name to the list?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice men stick around when the going gets tough</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bad men do not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bad men don’t like commitment and that doesn’t just mean shying away from ‘serious’ relationships (you dare to ask if they want to do something tomorrow) or marriage and kids, it means not being able to commit to anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like pick you up from work when you’re too sick to catch the tube or actually turn up when you’ve organized for him to meet your girlfriends or turn up as your plus one to that all important wedding of an ex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice guys don’t ask for endless favours</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like loaning them cash, letting them crash ‘for a night’ without paying rent, borrowing your car, your credit card, your suitcase – anything at all that’s of value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Nice men aren’t usually in a horrible financial mess and ‘between’ jobs. Bad guys are rarely in any other situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They also frequently have drug or alcohol problems, draining both your bank account, patience and sanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Nice men make you feel great</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They’re where they’re supposed to be, ring when they say they will, don’t let you down when you need them and are gloriously reliable and predictable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Bad men are the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They’re never where they say they’d be, they’re never on time and they never deliver no matter how many times they say they’ll change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This leaves you feeling jumpy, irritable and sleep deprived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You get spots, put on or lose weight (whichever isn’t helpful), have permanent bad hair days, pick up anything that’s going around and start to annoy friends and family by letting someone get to you like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Work colleagues start to lose respect when you stop pulling your weight – again - after the third up-all-night argument or fitful sleep waiting for a phone call that never comes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Your Mum’s worried sick and your friends have all but given up on you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even the hot sex loses its appeal when you develop the (inevitable) symptom of an STI or are so tired and fed up with the guy you can’t muster up the energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s around now that it occurs to you that this man isn’t an adventurous, world-travelling sex god who sticks his nose up at authority. He’s actually a self-obsessed, narcissistic idiot who can’t hold down a job or a relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Aren’t I glad I never did go for the bad boy – and am about to marry one of the nicest men on the planet!</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We live in a society that likes things done instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If our phone dares to take more than three seconds to load something, we’re annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You can order on amazon that morning and get it delivered to your door that same afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We expect love to follow the same format: we should know ‘instantly’ whether we’ve met our future partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But love <em>isn’t </em>about the lightning bolt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A recent survey found one in four singles miss out on love because they’re obsessed with finding an instant connection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Despite lots of couples claiming ‘they knew’ the minute their future husband or wife walked in the room (forgetting they felt like that about lots of people they didn’t end up with), in reality, lots of good relationships build rather than happen instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That flash of connection is a great sign and shouldn’t be discounted - it means the relationship has ‘a sprinkle of fairy dust’ (what <em>Times</em> columnist Suzi Godson calls sexual attraction).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But I can think of at least six people I know who didn’t feel chemistry at the start who are now very happily (and sexily) settled down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Will this be the case with you and the person you’re not sure of?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There’s good and bad news if you don’t fancy someone instantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A lot of attraction is known immediately – or at least fairly quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Our body knows whether we’re sexually attracted to someone before our brain can even register it.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When we first see someone we’re attracted to, our eyebrows rise and fall. If they like us back, they raise their eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The whole thing lasts about a fifth of a second and it happens everywhere in the world – to everyone, regardless of age, race or class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Watching for an eyebrow flash when you meet someone, can actually let <em>you</em> know they fancy you, before <em>their </em>brain has even registered it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How they smell is a huge influence</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You might think it’s all about looks but how we smell and taste to each other strongly determines whether you become a couple or remain friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Few people say ‘It was their smell that got me’ but very often it’s the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Each of us has a unique, natural, undetectable smell but we’re especially ‘whiffy’ (in a good way), when we’re aroused by someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you both fancy each other, powerful pheromones are released from apocrine glands, located in our warm spots (armpits, groin, mouth etc).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Your bodies then react to each other’s smell signals: finding each other more or less attractive because of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If only one fancies the other or neither of you initially do, pheromones still release but the effect isn’t as noticeable or powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That’s not to say they won’t start pumping out and working their magic if you decide someone is attractive later on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Also remember, we also give out different scents at different times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Women smell differently when ovulating and at their most fertile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lots of experiments prove men find women far more attractive and attainable when ovulating than at other time of the month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you can’t decide if you fancy someone or not and haven’t noticed how they smell, find some excuse to lean in closer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Position your nose close to a hot spot like their armpits (yes really) and take a big (discreet) whiff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If the smell isn’t right, you’ll know it’s not right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If they smell surprisingly good or you seem indifferent, it’s worth taking things one step further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How they taste is even more important</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Assuming you want to take the risk of moving the relationship forward, the absolute acid test to find out whether you fancy someone or not is to kiss them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Pucker up to kiss someone you’re attracted to and sebaceous glands in your mouth and the corners of your lips release semiochemicals that are designed to stimulate sexual excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">These combine with your own unique saliva ‘fingerprint’ and the end result is passed on during kissing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s a bit like swapping business cards listing your personal credentials, except it’s a hell of a lot sexier!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Your olfactory systems then have a snap meeting to decide whether or not you’re a good genetic match.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you aren’t, that kiss will feel and taste weird (as anyone who has ever had a strangely off-putting kiss with someone they like the look of can testify.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But what happens if you don’t fancy someone when you kiss them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Will the semiochemicals release simply because the person is technically a good kisser?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Happily, the answer is yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The <em>way </em>we kiss someone for the first time has a direct effect on whether a relationship progresses further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Sexual technique counts for more than you think</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You might feel the very first spark of physical attraction for someone only when you start getting physical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Remember the six people I know that ended up together even when they weren’t attracted initially?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most of those relationships followed the same pattern: they were drawn to the person intellectually or emotionally and wanted to like them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After four or five dates they were still unsure whether the relationship was friendship or potential romance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Each decided the only way to find out was to jump straight in there, have a good snog and then decide whether to take it further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Good plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Not only does that give you the chance to take the all-important taste and smell test, you also give each other a chance to show off your love-making skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Just as lots of people fall for someone when they see them doing something they love (like working or playing an instrument), plenty of others go weak at the knees when they find out their ‘friend’ has a fantastic kissing technique or is great at foreplay or sex in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Technique can trump sexual chemistry long-term.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Chemistry and desire usually fade with time and that’s when technique is crucial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A lover who knows what they’re doing will keep your interest longer than someone who merely looks hot because looks fade and technique doesn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Attraction builds for reasons other than what we first see</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sexual attraction is powerful and unpredictable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s also indiscriminate and common: most people feel sexually attracted to quite a lot of people, quite often.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Real, lasting love is something that doesn’t happen all the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Finding someone sexually attractive long-term is built on more than what you see at first glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The more we see of someone, the more of them we see. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We look past the outside to the inside and find ourselves attracted to their personality, sense of humour, the way they see the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Body language affects how attractive someone is to us; we might suddenly notice the timbre of their voice, find their choice of language seductive, the way they look at us now they know us more, the gestures they make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A smile, a touch delivered unexpectedly, realizing you’re missing them: all these factors can spark physical desire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most research points to the fact that we need a mix of key ingredients to remain happily in love – intimacy, commitment and passion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For most of us, passion usually appears in the form of sexual passion at the start of a relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Others feel deeply for someone first, connecting on an emotional, spiritual or intellectual level, and find the physical desire comes later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re not sure what you’re feeling right now – friendship or potential lust or love – give it a chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After all, the worst that can happen is that you end up with another great friend.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No-one can predict whether your partner is going to betray you by cheating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But, thanks to research, we now know there are certain factors that predispose people to being unfaithful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some of these are within your partner’s control – like whether they have a history of infidelity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Others aren’t - their parents had affairs, they’re good looking or they happen to work in finance (the most adulterous profession of all).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This list will make you paranoid if your partner ticks all the boxes but it still doesn’t mean they will definitely cheat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As with any relationship advice, trust your instincts as you answer each of the questions below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But if your partner does score highly, be aware they are more vulnerable to temptation than most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Keep both your heart and your eyes open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Were they with someone else when you met?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘Mate poaching’ – stealing someone else’s partner - is incredibly common in the US (and UK).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Three separate studies set out to find out if luring someone away from another results in a healthy, long-term relationship with the person they left to be with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The answer in a nutshell is no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Poached partners tend to be in more dysfunctional relationships, make less reliable mates and are less satisfied and committed than people who were single and available when you met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The studies also showed they’re more likely to cheat and have more narcissistic traits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How often are you having sex?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most people assume if they’re still having lots of sex with their partner, it means they’re not getting it elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While low or no sex does make it more likely for your partner to cheat, men particularly often become hyperactive sexually when they start having an affair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s change that you should be on the alert for: if your partner suddenly wants a lot more sex with you for no apparent reason, chances are their sex drive has been awakened by someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Have they stopped watching porn?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A survey by Illicit Encounters, the website for married people looking for an affair, found half of the 1400 men they polled stopped watching porn completely while they were having affairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Other research has found people who watch porn and masturbate are less likely to cheat than those who don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Did either of their parents have an affair?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You would think that a child who’d witnessed a parent having an affair and being found out would make them less likely to cheat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The reality is sometimes the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Watching the devastation affairs cause prompts our protective subconscious to ask: “Who would you rather be? The one who cheated or the one who’s devastated by it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s not a conscious choice but it does happen: the child grows into an adult who abhors cheating but finds themselves doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Parental affairs might be common but their effect is still long-reaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ideally, your partner would have happy, faithful parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Have they cheated before?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The ‘once a cheat, always a cheat’ belief does have truth to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But the crucial question to ask if your partner has a history of cheating is <em>why</em> they did it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A true serial cheater has no moral compass and will often see nothing wrong with being unfaithful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Other people cheat in relationships they aren’t committed to or aren’t happy in, others have affairs in retribution for a partner who cheated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Find out the circumstances behind why they did what they did. Then ask yourself: “Is our relationship different than the rest” or “Are they in a very different place now than they were then”?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How good looking are they?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A Harvard University study (US) revealed a definite correlation between attractiveness and divorce, leading researchers to conclude that being good looking was ‘a relationship liability’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A relationship with someone attractive is definitely more vulnerable to threats than one with someone who isn’t so appealing, especially if you’re going through a rough patch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Interestingly, how good-looking your partner <em>thinks</em> they are is almost as important as how attractive they actually are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The more attractive we feel, the more likely we are to find infidelity appealing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How much opportunity do they have to meet people and get away with cheating? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If your partner’s straight and works in a same sex office with little interaction with new people, they have low temptation and opportunity to play away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The partner who works for a large company and has a job that involves constantly meeting new people has more temptation than others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If they also travel for work, there are more opportunities to sleep with other people and not be found out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is also highly influenced by the following factor…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How much daily contact do you have with your partner?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">How many times a day do you check in on each other and how do you make that contact?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re texting a few times throughout the day, with at least one or two phone calls as well, it’s harder for a partner to get away with cheating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We pick up a lot about someone’s emotional state by their voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Having to explain why they’re out of contact when they usually are is difficult and the simple act of receiving a text or ignoring a call from you presses all their guilt buttons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The better you know your partner’s routine and whereabouts, the less likely they are to think they could get away with cheating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How close are you?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A disturbing fact is the majority of reputable studies have found the majority of people who commit adultery are happy in their lives and relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A Rutgers University study found 56 per cent of men and 34 per cent of women who had affairs were happy with their partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So knowing your partner is happy doesn’t mean they won’t cheat but if you’re in a very close relationship, you’re much more likely to instinctively know something is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We are closest to the people who know the most about us and if your partner is suddenly sharing all their intimate stuff with someone else, you’re much more likely to notice than a couple who don’t communicate well or tell each other everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How well do you know their friends?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Eighty-five per cent of cheating is with a co-worker, with friends and neighbours not too far behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s also true people are less likely to have an affair with a work colleague if they’ve met their partners: it’s very easy to pretend someone’s single if you’ve never seen evidence to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The more of your partner’s friends and colleagues you know, the more visible your relationship is to other people who may fancy them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s also more likely you’ll pick up on any telling body language between the two of them or directed their way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re well liked, friends will also step in to talk your partner out of any plans to misbehave if they’re tempted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>How much do they drink?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Studies show men who drink no more than the recommended weekly total are 82% less likely to commit adultery than heavy drinkers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Women are also far more likely to cheat when drunk – for all the obvious reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Excessive drinking makes us lose judgement, relaxes inhibitions and creates the infamous ‘beer goggles’, making us fancy people we wouldn’t be interested in sober.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If your partner drinks heavily with his or her friends or workmates without you around, this is a flashing red light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Does cheating fit with their moral code?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I’m not for a minute suggesting nice people don’t cheat – they do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But if your partner gets upset when they see or hear about other friends cheating, it’s a good sign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There might be circumstances when they’re tempted but it’s a lot less likely to happen if they find the concept of infidelity distasteful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>If your partner has cheated or you’re tempted to yourself, counselling can help.

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Studies show men still initiate sex twice as many times as women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The question - given the liberated times we live in now – is why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Research repeatedly shows the more frequently either partner initiates, the more pleased they both tend to be with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s nice to be seduced and you initiating sends a strong signal to your partner: <em>I desire you. I want you. You’re attractive to me.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you never suggest sex, how does your partner know you’re not having it just to please them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">They don’t – and most women know this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So why are we still the ones agreeing to sex rather than asking for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘Because men invariably get in their first’ is the most common answer women give. But there are other reasons at play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Women are actually more bored by monogamy than men are.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A German researcher found men and women in new relationships, on average, report more or less equal desire for each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fast forward and the results change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There’s a sharp desire dive for women who’ve been with their partners between one and four years that doesn’t happen to men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Men are already ahead of the game when it comes to sex drive because they have more naturally occurring testosterone, the hormone that influences our sex drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For women, it’s a lose-lose scenario: we don’t initiate sex because our sex drives drop dramatically long-term and our libido’s don’t get a much-needed boost <em>because</em> we don’t take charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Initiating sex is a libido booster and it’s men who get the benefits of ‘the thrill of the chase’ – the gender that least needs it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Society says it’s the man’s job to initiate</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There’s another belief that says the biggest turn on for women is their partner wanting them – they want men to ‘take charge’ and ‘throw them around the bedroom’ and be the sexual initiators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No-one is going to argue this isn’t a turn on - we all want sex with someone who clearly desires us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But if we hardly ever initiate, we don’t get the erotic charge of power initiating delivers: it’s sexier being the one asking for sex than the one submitting to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Submission can be highly erotic if you’re playing out a hot <em>Fifty Shades</em> style fantasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Not so sexy when submission is giving a resigned nod and stifling a yawn when his hand appears on your thigh just as you’re nodding off to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>We don’t initiate sex because we worry we’ll be rejected </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Women love blaming themselves – if our partner stops initiating sex, we think it’s something we’ve done to cause it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We’re too fat, not sexy enough, no good in bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We worry about taking charge and suggesting sex with our partner in case it isn’t sex they don’t want, they just don’t want sex with <em>us.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So there you have it: some of the reasons why women don’t initiate and the many positives that happen if you do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re the passive partner and want to revamp your sex life with one simple move, here’s how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>HOW TO INITIATE SEX</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You don’t have to make like a porn star to let your partner know you’re keen for sex. But you do need to…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Make sure your signals are clear</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here’s what will happen if they aren’t: he might not clock that you’re suggesting sex and miss it completely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You feel rejected and angry; he doesn’t even know you were up for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Not being clear also leaves both of you in the dangerous position of having to guess which touches are expressions of affection and which are meant as a sexual signal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ideally, you’d talk about it together and come up with some specific ways you could signal interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>You don’t have to be blatant or overt</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It could be something as simple as a kiss that lasts longer than usual with added tongue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It could be stroking your partner somewhere near a sexual zone to see what response you get or slipping a sexy note into his pocket before work detailing what you’d like to do that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Try getting in the bath or shower and inviting him in or letting him know that when you wear a certain piece of underwear, it means you’re up for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Some couples have magnets on the fridge that they move high or low to indicate whether they feel like sex that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Tread gently if you’re initiating because he’s stopped wanting sex at all</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What if your partner doesn’t just want less sex, they want no sex at all?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Opinion sharply divides on whether you should be trying to tempt him back to sex in this scenario by doing overtly suggestive things like answering the door in nothing but a pair of heels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The reason why is that it works on some men and freaks the hell out of the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What reaction you’ll get depends on why he’s off sex in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If it’s because he sees you as a friend rather than a lover, shocking him into seeing you as a good old-fashioned sex object could well do the trick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If he’s avoiding sex because of erection problems, the pressure of not being able to perform when you so desperately want him to, could be absolutely disastrous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A ‘real man’ would be rock hard if treated to what you’re offering, he thinks. If he’s not, his sexual confidence slides quietly through the floorboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Another reason why this can backfire: one of the reasons people go off sex long-term is that sex is <em>too</em> available. So pushing it in his face (perhaps literally) doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There’s a reason why weight loss experts say to fill the house with chocolates and cakes: the more readily available something is, the less we want it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Talk honestly about why his libido is dampened rather than launch straight into something you saw on a B-grade movie once and chose a technique that suits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>It really isn’t all about you</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">You’ve initiated sex and he knocked you back?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It doesn’t mean you didn’t do it properly or what you did wasn’t sexy enough: there are many reasons why men go off sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Look at his lifestyle and help him to cut back on alcohol, quit smoking, exercise, reduce stress wherever possible and get enough sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Get him to see a doctor if you think he may be suffering from low testosterone or struggling with erection problems so avoiding sex out of embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">These are far more likely reasons for him not wanting to have sex so try not to take it personally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He could simply have had a bad day and be tired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Men aren’t the sex robots we think they are!</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">How easy is it to look into other people’s relationships and judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Who didn’t shout ‘What are you DOING!!’ when we read Katy Perry was giving John ‘The Player’ Mayer another chance?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Who hasn’t rolled their eyes when a friend makes yet another excuse for her exes no show, conveniently forgetting she did the same when <em>our</em> ex behaved badly and we turned the other cheek?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It’s easy to judge others because you’re not the one standing in the middle of the situation, with a full knowledge of all the facts but flooded with emotion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">When someone you love hurts you, it’s never easy deciding whether to punish or forgive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">An eye for an eye is what our body urges us towards; our brains are more likely to weigh up both sides and perhaps opt for forgiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But which is more effective at stopping our partners from behaving badly in the future?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The answer to that appears to be both – but under very specific circumstances and in a certain order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The argument for forgiveness</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A four-year study of newlywed couples (in 2011) looked at the two different ways of getting an errant partner back on the straight and narrow to gauge which works the best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There are two opposing theories about which is best for your relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In support of forgiveness is <em>The reciprocity theory.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Research tells us people feel obligated to repay people who do favours for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you forgive your partner, rather than punish, they’ll be more motivated to want to please you and change their behavior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Forgiving someone also means consciously stopping yourself from hurting by allowing the healing process to begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">No-one likes feeling angry and hurt – it’s draining and horrible. Once you forgive, you consciously start to let go of the negative feelings and move into a nicer place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It restores the relationship and allows you both to make a fresh start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So forgiveness has got to be the winner, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The study showed forgiveness <em>did </em>work better short-term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But that’s just half the story…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Why punishing is important</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">On the other side of the fence is <em>The operant learning theory. </em>This works on the premise that we only change our behaviour if there are consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you don’t punish your partner for what they did with some sort of negative consequence, they don’t learn to change so are more likely to reoffend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">People feel better when they believe their partner has got their just deserts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you feel they ‘got away with it’, resentment settles in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Punishment also helps heal the relationship because the victim feels empowered and back in control, tipping the power scales back to even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This could be why long-term, the research showed punishment proved more effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The study showed partners who didn’t forgive too easily had better behaved spouses over the four-year period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But wait, there’s more…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The best solution is to do both: punish first THEN forgive.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A 2014 Australian study (University of Adelaide professors Peter Strelan and Jan-Willem van Prooijen) found while people think of punishment and forgiveness as opposites, a combination of both could well be the key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Their research showed the most effective way to control a partner’s bad behavior is to punish first and then forgive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If our partner wrongs us, we feel demeaned, out of control and disconnected from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Forgiving without punishment makes us feel even more vulnerable and that leads to suspicion and resentment further down the track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Punishing <em>before</em> forgiving makes the victim feel empowered. Once empowered, you feel stronger and more comfortable forgiving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This only works however, if you’ve dealt out a fitting punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>The punishment must fit the crime</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is crucial: the offender <em>must </em>suffer to the same degree as the person they hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If this does happen, says Professor Stelan, the victim’s suffering is theoretically cancelled out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Also remember: there’s a difference between punishment and revenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Punishment is fair. Revenge makes them suffer more than they made you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Take revenge rather than punish and you set off a nasty chain reaction: they strike back, you strike again and before you know it you’re arch enemies rather than two people trying to repair a damaged relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The previous study (2011) also came to the conclusion that couples should choose their battles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Their research concluded that it’s best to forgive minor offences and hold your partner accountable for serious or repeat offences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>So what is the best, most effective punishment?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Forget satisfying solutions like cutting one arm off each of his suits or scratching her beloved car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A good talking to is what works best, according to Professor Strelan’s research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most people feel guilty when they’ve done something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Which is why being told how much you’ve hurt and disappointed someone you love dearly – and seeing how it’s affected them - is the most effective way to stop them doing it again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The couples in Stelan’s study said once they’d told their partner why they were hurt and saw how guilty their partner was hearing about it, forgiveness was much easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And if talking doesn’t do it, the silent treatment just might.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">If you’re a couple who are good at talking through differences, refusing to discuss it until you feel ready will absolutely let your partner know they really have stepped out of line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Once you’ve punished, there are only two ways forward.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The first is to choose not to forgive but agree to stop talking about it – continually harping on about something they did just destroys the relationship over time. You might as well leave now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The second choice is to genuinely forgive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Either way: move forward with caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Resist the urge to reward their bad behavior by going overboard with forgiveness and understanding and doing nice things to ‘fix’ you both because you’re feeling vulnerable and want everything to be back to normal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This sends a clear signal: Even if I did punish you, it’s clear I’m so desperate to be with you, I’ll put up with anything you dish out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Instead, be affectionate and nice but just that little bit cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">That way, they realise how hurt you were and that they need to work hard to regain your trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><strong>If you need help with your relationship, contact <a href="http://www.itsgoodtotalk.org.uk/">itsgoodtotalk.org.uk</a>&#0160;or <a href="https://www.relate.org.uk/">relate.org.uk</a>. </strong></span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Human beings are funny creatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We’ll turn that disastrous attempt at a new intercourse position into dinner party fodder but when it comes to the most innocent, basic sexual act of all, we’re about as likely to ’fess up as the guy in the corner suffering silently from an attack of piles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We might well be the most sexually uninhibited generation so far, but masturbation, particularly female mastur­bation, still has a dirty name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even my friends, used to me blurting out all sorts of bizarre sex statistics, aren’t comfortable with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘What do you do to break the boredom of sitting behind a computer for hours on end?’ a girlfriend asked me recently, during lunch with a group of friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘Drink tea mostly,’ I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘Oh – and I masturbate. It’s a little treat that breaks up the day and perks me up no end.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There was a deathly silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Knives and forks paused mid-air, someone choked on a mouthful of wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><em>‘Excuse me?’ </em>my friend spluttered, redder than the beetroot on her plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">‘I said I take masturbation breaks,’ I repeated lamely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">And even I started to feel a tad embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So I was ridiculously pleased to find out a survey on the masturbation habits of Brits, found most of you are just like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The survey was done by global sex toy retailer, <a href="https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/">Lovehoney</a>, who researched a hefty sample of 4500 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The found men do it more than women – no surprise there!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sixty-five per cent of British men masturbate regularly, 30 per cent do it sometimes and only five per cent not at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">(Are they really men under 80 who don’t do it at all?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fifty-eight per cent of women do it regularly, 35 per cent sometimes and seven per cent never at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Both sexes agreed that solo sex sessions don’t detract from sex with their partner (68 per cent of men and 55 per cent of women), contrary to the myth that says we should be ‘saving ourselves’ for ‘real sex’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Which makes it even stranger that although everybody does it (and if they don’t, they should), few admit it and hardly anyone discusses it freely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Masturbation remains one of the few sex subjects that can make the most liberated person blush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Lots still view mastur­bation as something you do when ‘you can’t get any’, fearing that if they’re ‘reduced’ to masturbating, they’re not sexually desirable enough to score the real thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In reality, the more sexually active you are, the more likely you are to masturbate, regardless of whether you do or don’t have a partner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Kinsey, the world’s best known sex expert, found people who masturbated early in life led more vigorous sex lives than those who didn’t, and continued having an active sex life long past when the average person stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is one area where men come up trumps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most women masturbate about once a week, often not doing it regularly until their late teens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most men masturbate at least twice as often, and started doing so around 12 or 13 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Of the women who have discovered its joys, virtually all can masturbate to orgasm – 95 per cent of us, in fact (and some researchers put that figure even higher).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">On the opposite side, if you’re a female who has never masturbated, statistics indicate it’s quite likely you’ve never had an orgasm in your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Pretty strong support for solo sex!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Men and women are surprisingly similar in other masturbation habits, according to the Lovehoney survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Our favourite solo sex fantasy is the same - and it’s actually sex with our current partner that takes top billing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The top five masturbation fantasies are also the same for both sexes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Masturbating to erotica and/or porn scored second place, bondage fantasies came third with fantasies involving role-play and fantasies involving exes in fourth and fifth place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Both sexes think about exes while pleasuring themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fifty- eight per cent of men and 48 per cent of women fantasise about a previous partner even when in a happy relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sixty nine per cent of women and 60 per cent of men said masturbating improves their mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Being in a relationship doesn’t stop us doing it either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Sixty per cent of men and 51 per cent of women continue to have solo sex sessions when they are attached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The truth is good girls <em>do </em>do it and if you’re a woman who never has and won’t try, give up now on ever having a fulfilling sex life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Masturbation is a sure way (often the only way) to discover what turns you on sexually, and unless you know how to excite yourself, you’ve got zero chance of telling your partner how to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Few of us are lucky enough to start our sexual lives with a lover who’s so patient and skilled he can teach us about our own body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Besides, masturbating is good for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It releases tension, frees inhibitions, is gloriously liberating – and beats the hell out of counting sheep if you’re having trouble dropping off!</span></p>
