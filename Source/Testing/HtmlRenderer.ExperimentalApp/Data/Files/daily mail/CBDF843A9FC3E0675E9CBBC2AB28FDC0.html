<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

First published in 1896 by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, and his brother Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere, it is the United Kingdom's second biggest-selling daily newspaper after <i>The Sun</i>. Its sister paper <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> was launched in 1982. Scottish and Irish editions of the daily paper were launched in 1947 and 2006 respectively. The <i>Daily Mail</i> was Britain's first daily newspaper aimed at the newly literate "lower-middle class market resulting from mass education, combining a low retail price with plenty of competitions, prizes and promotional gimmicks", and was the first British paper to sell a million copies a day.</p>
<p>Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere, a great-grandson of the one of the co-founders, is the current chairman and controlling shareholder of the Daily Mail and General Trust, though day-to-day editorial decisions for the newspaper are usually made by a team around the editor, Paul Dacre.</p>
<p>It was at the outset a newspaper for women, the first to provide features especially for them, and in the second half of 2013 had a 54.77% female readership, the only British newspaper whose female readers constitute more than 50% of its demographic.</p>
<p>It had an average daily circulation of 1,510,824 copies in November 2016. Between July and December 2013 it had an average daily readership of approximately 3.951 million, of whom approximately 2.503 million were in the ABC1 demographic and 1.448 million in the C2DE demographic. Its website has more than 100 million unique visitors per month.</p></div>

He is <i>de facto<\/i> scheduled to take office as the 45th President on <span>January 20<\/span>, 2017, however, the United States Electoral College will still vote on December 19, 2016, decisively declaring either candidate should take office.<\/p>\n<p>Trump was born and raised in the Queens borough of New York City and received a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":683,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/donald-trump\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T15:02:08.249596","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2010-09-09T20:31:06","item_count":4875,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/sD","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":6,"name":"Donald Trump","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","latitude":null,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","woeid":null,"category":"Person","ping_category":[]},{"id":8719,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/8719\/","slug":"media","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <b>mass media<\/b> is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","trend_rank_current":1,"image_height":337,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.246535","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","item_count":104890,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6e\/Pentonvilleiso19.jpg\/512px-Pentonvilleiso19.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":51,"name":"crime & courts","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","latitude":null,"recent_count":13,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[{"aliases":["police","cop","riot","swat","fbi","raid"],"name":"Police activity","description":"Whenever you see the police responding to a call or at the scene","symbol":"🚔","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/ping_categories\/10\/","slug":"police-activity","id":10}]},{"id":2,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","slug":"politics","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","trend_rank_current":2,"image_height":503,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":2,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","item_count":96331,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","visible":true,"daily_count":27,"name":"politics","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","latitude":null,"recent_count":5,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EXu7","importance":3,"tweet":{"tweet_id":"808319004574175236","user_id":"70511174","id":737955,"location":"Washington, D.C.","content":"Melania Trump was in Rockville today for a scheduling hearing in her defamation suit against Daily Mail and that ra… https:\/\/t.co\/gCtnZmmT0W","screen_name":"Hadas_Gold","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Hadas_Gold\/status\/808319004574175236","date":"2016-12-12T14:34:03","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/751550521400582149\/svqXUn8W_normal.jpg","name":"Hadas Gold"},"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":29,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","username":"rebecca.bratek","full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","is_staff":false,"email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca","last_name":"Bratek"},"status":"published","content":"Statement: Melania Trump was in Rockville, Md., on Monday for a scheduling hearing in her defamation suit against Daily Mail - @Hadas_Gold","url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","slug":"statement-melania-trump-was-in-rockville-md-on","submitter":"editor","source":null,"data_type":null,"latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/12\/statement-melania-trump-was-in-rockville-md-on","ping":null,"pushed":true,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/web\/status\/808319004574175236","date":"2016-12-12T15:23:56.072660","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","data":null},{"id":963542,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/963542\/","url_domain":"theguardian.com","push_content":"Daily Mail owner cuts more than 400 jobs as it battles 'challenging market' - Guardian","media":null,"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2duw0sc","updated_date":"2016-09-29T16:22:31.625265","note":null,"whoas":29,"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/29\/daily-mail-owner-cuts-more-than-400-jobs-as-it","type":"text","date_ap":"Sep 29, 2016, 04:22 PM GMT","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/media\/2016\/sep\/29\/daily-mail-cost-cuts-dmgt","topics":[{"id":2929,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2929\/","slug":"daily-mail","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2929","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <i><b>Daily Mail<\/b><\/i> is a British daily conservative, middle-market tabloid newspaper owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust and published in London.

Its sister paper <i>The Mail on Sunday<\/i> was launched in 1982. Scottish and Irish editions of the daily paper were launched in 1947 and 2006 respectively.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":683,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/donald-trump\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T15:02:08.249596","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2010-09-09T20:31:06","item_count":4875,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/sD","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":6,"name":"Donald Trump","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","latitude":null,"recent_count":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","woeid":null,"category":"Person","ping_category":[]},{"id":152,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","slug":"elections","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation.

One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.

While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures.

Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","trend_rank_current":2,"image_height":503,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":2,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","item_count":96331,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","visible":true,"daily_count":27,"name":"politics","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","latitude":null,"recent_count":5,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D6Yv","importance":2,"tweet":{"tweet_id":"771450714891620352","user_id":"218325695","id":660070,"location":"Washington, DC","content":"And Melania Trump is now officially suing the Daily Mail and a blogger for $150 million https:\/\/t.co\/9lm78FaKMf","screen_name":"Bencjacobs","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Bencjacobs\/status\/771450714891620352","date":"2016-09-01T20:52:37","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/719670250103410688\/ZKaRQjgr_normal.jpg","name":"Ben Jacobs"},"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":8,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","username":"stephanie.clary","full_name":"Stephanie Clary","is_staff":true,"email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","first_name":"Stephanie","last_name":"Clary"},"status":"published","content":"Melania Trump files lawsuit against Daily Mail and blogger Webster G.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","trend_rank_current":86,"image_height":256,"kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":86,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","item_count":12097,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","placetype":"Country","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","longitude":-2.23001,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":1,"name":"United Kingdom","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","woeid":23424975,"category":"Country","ping_category":[]},{"id":509,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/509\/","slug":"cocaine","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=509","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Cocaine<\/b>, also known as <b>coke<\/b>, is a strong stimulant mostly used as a recreational drug. It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.<\/p>\n<p>Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.<\/p>\n<p>Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the <i>coca<\/i> plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.<\/p>\n<p>After cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world use cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013 cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. The leaves of the <i>coca<\/i> plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-21T01:26:46.245972","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":253,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/cocaine\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:50:37.119912","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cocaine\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2010-05-27T12:40:54","item_count":290,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IN","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/66\/Kokain_-_Cocaine.svg\/512px-Kokain_-_Cocaine.svg.png","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"cocaine","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cocaine","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cocaine\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=509","woeid":null,"category":"MedicalTreatment","ping_category":[]},{"id":2929,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2929\/","slug":"daily-mail","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2929","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <i><b>Daily Mail<\/b><\/i> is a British daily conservative, middle-market tabloid newspaper owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust and published in London.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","trend_rank_current":86,"image_height":256,"kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":86,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","item_count":12097,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","placetype":"Country","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","longitude":-2.23001,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":1,"name":"United Kingdom","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","woeid":23424975,"category":"Country","ping_category":[]},{"id":2929,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2929\/","slug":"daily-mail","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2929","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <i><b>Daily Mail<\/b><\/i> is a British daily conservative, middle-market tabloid newspaper owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust and published in London.

Gun related violence may or may not be considered criminal. Criminal, includes homicide (except when and where ruled justifiable), assault with a deadly weapon, and suicide, or attempted suicide, depending on jurisdiction. Non-criminal violence may include accidental or unintentional injury and death. Included in this subject are statistics regarding military or para-military activities, as well as the actions of civilians.<\/p>\n\n<p>According to GunPolicy.org, 75 percent of the world's 875 million guns are civilian controlled. Globally, millions are wounded through the use of guns. Assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths in 2013 up from 128,000 deaths in 1990. There were additionally 47,000 unintentional firearm related deaths in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>Levels of gun related violence vary greatly among geographical regions, countries, and even subnationally.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","trend_rank_current":1,"image_height":337,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.246535","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","item_count":104890,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6e\/Pentonvilleiso19.jpg\/512px-Pentonvilleiso19.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":51,"name":"crime & courts","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","latitude":null,"recent_count":13,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[{"aliases":["police","cop","riot","swat","fbi","raid"],"name":"Police activity","description":"Whenever you see the police responding to a call or at the scene","symbol":"🚔","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/ping_categories\/10\/","slug":"police-activity","id":10}]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dmfw","importance":1,"tweet":{"tweet_id":"743558574249492480","user_id":"21910500","id":606283,"location":"","content":"Friday's Daily Mail:\nWhat a tragic waste\n#tomorrowspaperstoday #bbcpapers https:\/\/t.co\/hgT8Da0LvH","screen_name":"suttonnick","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/suttonnick\/status\/743558574249492480","date":"2016-06-16T21:39:13","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1755035598\/image_normal.jpg","name":"Nick Sutton"},"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":14,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","username":"jillian.stampher","full_name":"Jillian Stampher","is_staff":false,"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Jillian","last_name":"Stampher"},"status":"published","content":"Photo: The Daily Mail's front page for Friday after deadly shooting of Jo Cox - @suttonnick","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","slug":"photo-the-daily-mails-front-page-for-friday","submitter":"editor","source":null,"data_type":null,"latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/06\/16\/photo-the-daily-mails-front-page-for-friday","ping":null,"pushed":false,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/suttonnick\/status\/743558574249492480\/photo\/1","date":"2016-06-16T23:03:04.910590","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","data":null},{"id":840940,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/840940\/","url_domain":"breakingnews.com","push_content":"Publisher of the Daily Mail downgrades outlook on print advertising slump - Reuters","media":null,"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dgvi","updated_date":"2016-05-26T06:37:02.001044","note":null,"whoas":5,"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/05\/26\/publisher-of-the-daily-mail-downgrades-outlook-on","type":"text","date_ap":"May 26, 2016, 06:36 AM GMT","url":"","topics":[{"id":2797,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2797\/","slug":"advertising","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2797","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Advertising<\/b> is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \"ad\".<\/p>\n<p>Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through \"branding,\" which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct response advertising. Non-commercial advertisers who spend money to advertise items other than a consumer product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of persuasion, such as a public service announcement. Advertising may also be used to reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.<\/p>\n<p>Modern advertising was created with the techniques introduced with tobacco advertising in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of Edward Bernays, considered the founder of modern, \"Madison Avenue\" advertising.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, the world spent an estimate of <span>US$592.43<span> <\/span>billion<\/span> on advertising.

A deal may be euphemistically called a \"<b>merger of equals<\/b>\" if both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies, while when the deal is unfriendly (that is, when the management of the target company opposes the deal) it may be regarded as an \"acquisition\".<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-29T16:14:25.064194","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":384,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/mergers-acquisitions\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:59:53.055571","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mergers_and_acquisitions\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2013-08-28T14:31:59.595566","item_count":2444,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSN","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/f5\/Photos_NewYork1_032.jpg\/512px-Photos_NewYork1_032.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"mergers & acquisitions","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mergers_and_acquisitions","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/mergers-acquisitions\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43413","woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","ping_category":[]},{"id":1550,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1550\/","slug":"yahoo","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1550","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Yahoo Inc.<\/b> (also known simply as <b>Yahoo!<\/b>) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","trend_rank_current":37,"image_height":612,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":37,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","item_count":13501,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingbytes","visible":true,"daily_count":3,"name":"tech","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","latitude":null,"recent_count":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DZJ4","importance":3,"tweet":{"tweet_id":"722794265215180800","user_id":"15110357","id":572208,"location":"Where you are","content":"BREAKING: Daily Mail says it has not submitted a bid to purchase Yahoo, remains in discussions with parties who may be interested","screen_name":"ReutersBiz","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReutersBiz\/status\/722794265215180800","date":"2016-04-20T14:29:16","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/2259175576\/reuters_twitter_avatar_normal.png","name":"Reuters Business"},"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":30,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/30\/","username":"shelley.ng","full_name":"Shelley Ng","is_staff":false,"email":"shelley.ng@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Shelley","last_name":"Ng"},"status":"published","content":"Daily Mail says it has not submitted a bid to purchase Yahoo, remains in discussions with parties who may be interested - Reuters","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","slug":"daily-mail-says-it-has-not-submitted-a-bid-to-purc","submitter":"editor","source":null,"data_type":null,"latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/04\/20\/daily-mail-says-it-has-not-submitted-a-bid-to-purc","ping":null,"pushed":true,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ReutersBiz\/status\/722794265215180800","date":"2016-04-20T14:39:04.162416","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","data":null},{"id":804724,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/804724\/","url_domain":"www.wsj.com","push_content":"Daily Mail spokesperson confirms 'early stage' talks with investors on potential Yahoo bid - Wall Street Journal","media":null,"shortened_url":"http:\/\/on.wsj.com\/25TqQfa","updated_date":"2016-04-29T20:22:24.332263","note":null,"whoas":14,"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/04\/11\/daily-mail-spokesperson-confirms-early-stage-tal","type":"text","date_ap":"Apr 11, 2016, 01:13 PM GMT","url":"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/u-k-s-daily-mail-explores-bid-for-yahoo-backed-by-private-equity-1460324999","topics":[{"id":337758,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/337758\/","slug":"yahoo-sells-internet-assets","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=337758","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Yahoo Inc.<\/b> (also known simply as <b>Yahoo!<\/b>) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.

Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","trend_rank_current":37,"image_height":612,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":37,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","item_count":13501,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingbytes","visible":true,"daily_count":3,"name":"tech","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","latitude":null,"recent_count":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DXQT","importance":4,"tweet":{"tweet_id":"719279107683520512","user_id":"26574283","id":572210,"location":"","content":"BREAKING: Daily Mail in talks with several private equity firms for Yahoo bid - Dow Jones, citing source","screen_name":"CNBCnow","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CNBCnow\/status\/719279107683520512","date":"2016-04-10T21:41:17","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/671885461695021056\/NiO-i0bJ_normal.png","name":"CNBC Now"},"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":23,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","username":"tricia.mcdermott","full_name":"Tricia McDermott","is_staff":false,"email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Tricia","last_name":"McDermott"},"status":"published","content":"Daily Mail in talks with several private equity firms for Yahoo bid, reports Dow Jones, citing source - CNBC","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","slug":"daily-mail-in-talks-with-several-private-equity-fi","submitter":"editor","source":null,"data_type":null,"latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/04\/10\/daily-mail-in-talks-with-several-private-equity-fi","ping":null,"pushed":true,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CNBCnow\/status\/719279107683520512","date":"2016-04-10T21:47:05.289968","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","data":null},{"id":686278,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/686278\/","url_domain":"twitter.com","push_content":"Egypt's Foreign Minister Ahmed Abu Zeid says Thomson Airways plane was in no danger and 'airliners previously informed of military exercise and instructed of procedures' - @MfaEgypt","media":null,"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1NiCvry","updated_date":"2015-11-07T18:42:28.831835","note":null,"whoas":12,"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/11\/07\/egypts-foreign-minister-ahmed-abu-zeid-says-thoms","type":"text","date_ap":"Nov 07, 2015, 06:04 PM GMT","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MfaEgypt\/status\/663046038194884608","topics":[{"id":302103,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/302103\/","slug":"egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=302103","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Metrojet Flight 9268<\/b> (IATA: <b>7K9268<\/b>, ICAO: <b>KGL9268<\/b>) was an international chartered passenger flight, operated by Russian airline Kogalymavia (branded as Metrojet). On 31 October 2015 at 06:13 local time EST (04:13 UTC), an Airbus A321-231 operating the flight disintegrated above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, Egypt, en route to Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg, Russia. All 217 passengers and seven crew members who were on board were killed.<\/p>\n<p>Of those aboard, mostly tourists, there were 219 Russians, four Ukrainians, and one Belarusian. The possibility that a bomb was put on the aircraft at Sharm El Sheikh led several countries to suspend flights to that airport. With its death toll of 224 people, Flight 9268 is the deadliest air disaster both in the history of Russian aviation and within Egyptian territory. It is also the deadliest air disaster involving an aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, and the deadliest air disaster of 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the crash, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s Sinai Branch, previously known as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, claimed responsibility for the incident, which occurred in the vicinity of the Sinai insurgency. ISIL claimed responsibility on Twitter, on video, and in a statement by Abu Osama al-Masri, the leader of the group's Sinai branch. ISIL posted pictures of what it said was the bomb in <i>Dabiq<\/i>, its online magazine.<\/p>\n<p>By 4 November 2015, British and American authorities suspected that a bomb was responsible for the crash. On 8 November 2015, an anonymous member of the Egyptian investigation team said the investigators were \"90 percent sure\" that the jet was brought down by a bomb. Lead investigator Ayman al-Muqaddam said that other possible causes of the crash included a fuel explosion, metal fatigue, and lithium batteries overheating. The Russian Federal Security Service announced on 17 November that they were sure that it was a terrorist attack, caused by an improvised bomb containing the equivalent of up to 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of TNT that detonated during the flight. The Russians said they had found explosive residue as evidence. On 24 February 2016, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi acknowledged that terrorism caused the crash.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T16:30:45.404857","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":315,"kind":"arc","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:12:06.425605","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrojet_Flight_9268\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2015-10-31T08:06:05.425229","item_count":236,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BQkn","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Airbus_A321-231%2C_Middle_East_Airlines_-_MEA_AN0094392.jpg\/512px-Airbus_A321-231%2C_Middle_East_Airlines_-_MEA_AN0094392.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Egypt plane crash, Oct. 31, 2015","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrojet_Flight_9268","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=302103","woeid":null,"category":"DisasterAccidentEvent","ping_category":[]},{"id":160,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/160\/","slug":"egypt","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=160","links":"","geohash":"sstxb7bvf99j","description":"<p><b>Egypt<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/iː\/ long 'e' in 'seed'\">iː<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i><b><span><span>EE<\/span><\/span><\/b>-jipt<\/i><\/span>; Arabic: <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">مِصر<\/span>‎‎ <i><span title=\"Arabic transliteration\">Miṣr<\/span><\/i>, Egyptian Arabic: <span lang=\"arz\" dir=\"rtl\">مَصر<\/span>‎‎ <span title=\"Egyptian Spoken Arabic transliteration\"><i>Maṣr<\/i><\/span>, Coptic: <span>Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ<\/span> <i>Khemi<\/i>), officially the <b>Arab Republic of Egypt<\/b>, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.<\/p>\n<p>Egypt has among the longest histories of any modern country, emerging as one of the world's first nation states in the tenth millennium BC. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and at times assimilated, various foreign influences, including Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European. One of the earliest centres of Christianity, Egypt was Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority.<\/p>\n<p>With over 92 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab world, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world. The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.<\/p>\n<p>Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power, with significant cultural, political, and military influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world. Egypt's economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East, and is projected to become one of the largest in the 21st century. Egypt is a member of the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, Arab League, African Union, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-29T15:21:22.655205","trend_rank_current":126,"image_height":341,"kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/egypt\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:14:18.315852","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egypt\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":127,"created_on":"2010-06-01T11:45:29","item_count":4672,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ck","placetype":"Country","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/fe\/Flag_of_Egypt.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Egypt.svg.png","longitude":30.796391,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Egypt","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egypt","latitude":26.83709,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/egypt\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=160","woeid":23424802,"category":"Country","ping_category":[]},{"id":303699,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/303699\/","slug":"ahmed-abu-zeid","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=303699","links":"","geohash":"","description":"","latest_item_date":"2016-12-24T17:07:58.164176","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":null,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/ahmed-abu-zeid\/","wikipedia_content_date":null,"image_credit":"","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2015-11-07T17:55:35.713875","item_count":4,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BRAX","placetype":"","image_url":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Ahmed Abu Zeid","wikipedia_url":"","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ahmed-abu-zeid\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=303699","woeid":null,"category":"Person","ping_category":[]},{"id":11694,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/11694\/","slug":"air-travel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=11694","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Air travel<\/b> is a form of travel in vehicles such as helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliding, parachuting, airplanes, jets, or anything else that can sustain flight.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","trend_rank_current":2,"image_height":503,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":2,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","item_count":96331,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","visible":true,"daily_count":27,"name":"politics","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","latitude":null,"recent_count":5,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]},{"id":66484,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/66484\/","slug":"travel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=66484","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

On 31 October 2015 at 06:13 local time EST (04:13 UTC), an Airbus A321-231 operating the flight disintegrated above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, Egypt, en route to Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg, Russia. All 217 passengers and seven crew members who were on board were killed.<\/p>\n<p>Of those aboard, mostly tourists, there were 219 Russians, four Ukrainians, and one Belarusian. The possibility that a bomb was put on the aircraft at Sharm El Sheikh led several countries to suspend flights to that airport. With its death toll of 224 people, Flight 9268 is the deadliest air disaster both in the history of Russian aviation and within Egyptian territory. It is also the deadliest air disaster involving an aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, and the deadliest air disaster of 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the crash, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s Sinai Branch, previously known as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, claimed responsibility for the incident, which occurred in the vicinity of the Sinai insurgency. ISIL claimed responsibility on Twitter, on video, and in a statement by Abu Osama al-Masri, the leader of the group's Sinai branch. ISIL posted pictures of what it said was the bomb in <i>Dabiq<\/i>, its online magazine.<\/p>\n<p>By 4 November 2015, British and American authorities suspected that a bomb was responsible for the crash. On 8 November 2015, an anonymous member of the Egyptian investigation team said the investigators were \"90 percent sure\" that the jet was brought down by a bomb. Lead investigator Ayman al-Muqaddam said that other possible causes of the crash included a fuel explosion, metal fatigue, and lithium batteries overheating. The Russian Federal Security Service announced on 17 November that they were sure that it was a terrorist attack, caused by an improvised bomb containing the equivalent of up to 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of TNT that detonated during the flight. The Russians said they had found explosive residue as evidence. On 24 February 2016, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi acknowledged that terrorism caused the crash.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T16:30:45.404857","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":315,"kind":"arc","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:12:06.425605","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrojet_Flight_9268\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2015-10-31T08:06:05.425229","item_count":236,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BQkn","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Airbus_A321-231%2C_Middle_East_Airlines_-_MEA_AN0094392.jpg\/512px-Airbus_A321-231%2C_Middle_East_Airlines_-_MEA_AN0094392.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Egypt plane crash, Oct. 31, 2015","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrojet_Flight_9268","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=302103","woeid":null,"category":"DisasterAccidentEvent","ping_category":[]},{"id":160,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/160\/","slug":"egypt","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=160","links":"","geohash":"sstxb7bvf99j","description":"<p><b>Egypt<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/iː\/ long 'e' in 'seed'\">iː<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i><b><span><span>EE<\/span><\/span><\/b>-jipt<\/i><\/span>; Arabic: <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">مِصر<\/span>‎‎ <i><span title=\"Arabic transliteration\">Miṣr<\/span><\/i>, Egyptian Arabic: <span lang=\"arz\" dir=\"rtl\">مَصر<\/span>‎‎ <span title=\"Egyptian Spoken Arabic transliteration\"><i>Maṣr<\/i><\/span>, Coptic: <span>Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ<\/span> <i>Khemi<\/i>), officially the <b>Arab Republic of Egypt<\/b>, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.<\/p>\n<p>Egypt has among the longest histories of any modern country, emerging as one of the world's first nation states in the tenth millennium BC. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and at times assimilated, various foreign influences, including Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European. One of the earliest centres of Christianity, Egypt was Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority.<\/p>\n<p>With over 92 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab world, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world. The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.<\/p>\n<p>Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power, with significant cultural, political, and military influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world. Egypt's economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East, and is projected to become one of the largest in the 21st century. Egypt is a member of the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, Arab League, African Union, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-29T15:21:22.655205","trend_rank_current":126,"image_height":341,"kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/egypt\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:14:18.315852","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egypt\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":127,"created_on":"2010-06-01T11:45:29","item_count":4672,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ck","placetype":"Country","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/fe\/Flag_of_Egypt.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Egypt.svg.png","longitude":30.796391,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Egypt","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egypt","latitude":26.83709,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/egypt\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=160","woeid":23424802,"category":"Country","ping_category":[]},{"id":303281,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/303281\/","slug":"sharm-el-sheikh-international-airport","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=303281","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Sharm El Sheikh International Airport<\/b> (Arabic: <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\" xml:lang=\"ar\">مطار شرم الشيخ الدولي<\/span>‎‎ <i>Maṭār Sharm El Sheikh El Dawli<\/i>) (IATA: <b>SSH<\/b>, ICAO: <b>HESH<\/b>), formerly known as <i>Ophira International Airport<\/i>, is an international airport located in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","trend_rank_current":1,"image_height":337,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.246535","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","item_count":104890,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6e\/Pentonvilleiso19.jpg\/512px-Pentonvilleiso19.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":51,"name":"crime & courts","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","latitude":null,"recent_count":13,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[{"aliases":["police","cop","riot","swat","fbi","raid"],"name":"Police activity","description":"Whenever you see the police responding to a call or at the scene","symbol":"🚔","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/ping_categories\/10\/","slug":"police-activity","id":10}]},{"id":2,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","slug":"politics","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","trend_rank_current":2,"image_height":503,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":2,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","item_count":96331,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","visible":true,"daily_count":27,"name":"politics","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","latitude":null,"recent_count":5,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]},{"id":66484,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/66484\/","slug":"travel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=66484","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Travel<\/b> is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations, and can involve travel by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, airplane, or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.

On 31 October 2015 at 06:13 local time EST (04:13 UTC), an Airbus A321-231 operating the flight disintegrated above the northern Sinai following its departure from Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, Egypt, en route to Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg, Russia. All 217 passengers and seven crew members who were on board were killed.<\/p>\n<p>Of those aboard, mostly tourists, there were 219 Russians, four Ukrainians, and one Belarusian. The possibility that a bomb was put on the aircraft at Sharm El Sheikh led several countries to suspend flights to that airport. With its death toll of 224 people, Flight 9268 is the deadliest air disaster both in the history of Russian aviation and within Egyptian territory. It is also the deadliest air disaster involving an aircraft from the Airbus A320 family, and the deadliest air disaster of 2015.<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after the crash, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s Sinai Branch, previously known as Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, claimed responsibility for the incident, which occurred in the vicinity of the Sinai insurgency. ISIL claimed responsibility on Twitter, on video, and in a statement by Abu Osama al-Masri, the leader of the group's Sinai branch. ISIL posted pictures of what it said was the bomb in <i>Dabiq<\/i>, its online magazine.<\/p>\n<p>By 4 November 2015, British and American authorities suspected that a bomb was responsible for the crash. On 8 November 2015, an anonymous member of the Egyptian investigation team said the investigators were \"90 percent sure\" that the jet was brought down by a bomb. Lead investigator Ayman al-Muqaddam said that other possible causes of the crash included a fuel explosion, metal fatigue, and lithium batteries overheating. The Russian Federal Security Service announced on 17 November that they were sure that it was a terrorist attack, caused by an improvised bomb containing the equivalent of up to 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of TNT that detonated during the flight. The Russians said they had found explosive residue as evidence. On 24 February 2016, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi acknowledged that terrorism caused the crash.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T16:30:45.404857","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":315,"kind":"arc","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:12:06.425605","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrojet_Flight_9268\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2015-10-31T08:06:05.425229","item_count":236,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BQkn","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/2e\/Airbus_A321-231%2C_Middle_East_Airlines_-_MEA_AN0094392.jpg\/512px-Airbus_A321-231%2C_Middle_East_Airlines_-_MEA_AN0094392.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Egypt plane crash, Oct. 31, 2015","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metrojet_Flight_9268","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/egypt-plane-crash-oct-31-2015\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=302103","woeid":null,"category":"DisasterAccidentEvent","ping_category":[]},{"id":160,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/160\/","slug":"egypt","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=160","links":"","geohash":"sstxb7bvf99j","description":"<p><b>Egypt<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/iː\/ long 'e' in 'seed'\">iː<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i><b><span><span>EE<\/span><\/span><\/b>-jipt<\/i><\/span>; Arabic: <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">مِصر<\/span>‎‎ <i><span title=\"Arabic transliteration\">Miṣr<\/span><\/i>, Egyptian Arabic: <span lang=\"arz\" dir=\"rtl\">مَصر<\/span>‎‎ <span title=\"Egyptian Spoken Arabic transliteration\"><i>Maṣr<\/i><\/span>, Coptic: <span>Ⲭⲏⲙⲓ<\/span> <i>Khemi<\/i>), officially the <b>Arab Republic of Egypt<\/b>, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.<\/p>\n<p>Egypt has among the longest histories of any modern country, emerging as one of the world's first nation states in the tenth millennium BC. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and at times assimilated, various foreign influences, including Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European. One of the earliest centres of Christianity, Egypt was Islamised in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country, albeit with a significant Christian minority.<\/p>\n<p>With over 92 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in North Africa and the Arab world, the third-most populous in Africa (after Nigeria and Ethiopia), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world. The great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an area of about 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 sq mi), where the only arable land is found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta.<\/p>\n<p>Modern Egypt is considered to be a regional and middle power, with significant cultural, political, and military influence in North Africa, the Middle East and the Muslim world. Egypt's economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East, and is projected to become one of the largest in the 21st century. Egypt is a member of the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, Arab League, African Union, and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-29T15:21:22.655205","trend_rank_current":126,"image_height":341,"kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/egypt\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:14:18.315852","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egypt\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":127,"created_on":"2010-06-01T11:45:29","item_count":4672,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ck","placetype":"Country","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/fe\/Flag_of_Egypt.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Egypt.svg.png","longitude":30.796391,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Egypt","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egypt","latitude":26.83709,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/egypt\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=160","woeid":23424802,"category":"Country","ping_category":[]},{"id":30,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","slug":"united-kingdom","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30","links":"","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","trend_rank_current":86,"image_height":256,"kind":"location","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":86,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","item_count":12097,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","placetype":"Country","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","longitude":-2.23001,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":1,"name":"United Kingdom","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","latitude":54.314072,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","woeid":23424975,"category":"Country","ping_category":[]},{"id":303699,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/303699\/","slug":"ahmed-abu-zeid","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=303699","links":"","geohash":"","description":"","latest_item_date":"2016-12-24T17:07:58.164176","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":null,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/ahmed-abu-zeid\/","wikipedia_content_date":null,"image_credit":"","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2015-11-07T17:55:35.713875","item_count":4,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BRAX","placetype":"","image_url":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Ahmed Abu Zeid","wikipedia_url":"","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ahmed-abu-zeid\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=303699","woeid":null,"category":"Person","ping_category":[]},{"id":11694,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/11694\/","slug":"air-travel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=11694","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Air travel<\/b> is a form of travel in vehicles such as helicopters, hot air balloons, blimps, gliders, hang gliding, parachuting, airplanes, jets, or anything else that can sustain flight.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It indicates how the revenues (money received from the sale of products and services before expenses are taken out, also known as the “top line”) are transformed into the net income (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for, also known as “net profit” or the “bottom line”). It displays the revenues recognized for a specific period, and the cost and expenses charged against these revenues, including write-offs (e.g., depreciation and amortization of various assets) and taxes. The purpose of the income statement is to show managers and investors whether the company made or lost money during the period being reported.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to remember about an income statement is that it represents a period of time like the cash flow statement. This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.<\/p>\n<p>Charitable organizations that are required to publish financial statements do not produce an income statement. Instead, they produce a similar statement that reflects funding sources compared against program expenses, administrative costs, and other operating commitments. This statement is commonly referred to as the statement of activities. Revenues and expenses are further categorized in the statement of activities by the donor restrictions on the funds received and expended.<\/p>\n<p>The income statement can be prepared in one of two methods. The Single Step income statement takes the simpler approach, totaling revenues and subtracting expenses to find the bottom line. The more complex Multi-Step income statement (as the name implies) takes several steps to find the bottom line, starting with the gross profit. It then calculates operating expenses and, when deducted from the gross profit, yields income from operations. Adding to income from operations is the difference of other revenues and other expenses. When combined with income from operations, this yields income before taxes. The final step is to deduct taxes, which finally produces the net income for the period measured.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-21T21:31:27.460266","trend_rank_current":318,"image_height":269,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/earnings\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:52:21.707067","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":321,"created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","item_count":3012,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FsU","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/49\/Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg\/512px-Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"earnings","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/earnings\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","ping_category":[]},{"id":8719,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/8719\/","slug":"media","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <b>mass media<\/b> is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

In November 2012, he was heavily criticised in the official findings of the Leveson Inquiry, when Lord Leveson stated that comments made in Morgan's testimony about phone hacking were \"utterly unpersuasive\" and \"clearly prove ... that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it\". Morgan has written eight books, including four volumes of memoirs.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-18T23:17:47.105716","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":768,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/piers-morgan\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:32:03.615054","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Piers_Morgan\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2011-04-12T23:32:58","item_count":41,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CFS","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/51\/Piers_Morgan_at_PaleyFest_2013.jpg\/512px-Piers_Morgan_at_PaleyFest_2013.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"Piers Morgan","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Piers_Morgan","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/piers-morgan\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=8016","woeid":null,"category":"Person","ping_category":[]},{"id":7,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","slug":"business","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that have the side purpose of explaining the origin of life, the Universe, and other things.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences.

Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture <i>Maleficent<\/i> (2014).<\/p>\n<p>In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and an honorary damehood of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.<\/p>\n<p>The word \"<b>cinema<\/b>\", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to the industry of films and filmmaking or to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of cinema is the art of simulating experiences to communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along with other sensory stimulations.<\/p>\n<p>Films were originally recorded onto plastic film through a photochemical process, and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen. The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish. Films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.<\/p>\n<p>Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer. Some have criticized the film industry's glorification of violence and its potentially negative treatment of women.<\/p>\n<p>The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection of traditional films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called phi phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>The name \"film\" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including <i>picture<\/i>, <i>picture show<\/i>, <i>moving picture<\/i>, <i>photoplay<\/i> and <i>flick<\/i>. The most common term in the United States is <i>movie<\/i>, while in Europe <i>film<\/i> is preferred. Terms for the field in general include <i>the big screen<\/i>, <i>the silver screen<\/i>, <i>the movies<\/i> and <i>cinema<\/i>; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. In early years, the word <i>sheet<\/i> was sometimes used instead of <i>screen<\/i>.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T04:00:01.839013","trend_rank_current":165,"image_height":231,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/film\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:54:49.170835","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Film\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":163,"created_on":"2012-12-11T02:56:34","item_count":2212,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bb","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/c4\/Fox_movietone_2.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"film","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Film","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/film\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":175,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=89","woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","ping_category":[]},{"id":1330,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1330\/","slug":"heroin","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1330","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Heroin<\/b>, also known as <b>diamorphine<\/b> among other names, is an opiate typically used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Medically it is occasionally used to relieve pain and as a form of opioid replacement therapy alongside counseling. Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein; however, it can also be smoked, snorted or inhaled. Onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours.<\/p>\n<p>Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing) and about a quarter of those who use heroin become physically dependent., Other side effects can include abscesses, infected heart valves, blood borne infections, constipation, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect as a similar dose of morphine. It typically comes as a white or brown powder.<\/p>\n<p>Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications used may include methadone or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. An estimated 17 million people as of 2015 use opiates such as heroin, which together with opioids resulted in 122,000 deaths. The total number of opiate users has increased from 1998 to 2007 after which it has remained more or less stable. In the United States about 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point in time. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid.<\/p>\n<p>Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell heroin without a license. In 2015 Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Often heroin, which is illegally sold, is mixed with other substances such as sugar or strychnine.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2016-12-16T18:04:30.242620","trend_rank_current":0,"image_height":341,"kind":"tag","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/heroin\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:35:27.481295","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heroin\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":0,"created_on":"2012-02-25T02:48:09","item_count":134,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Vc","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b1\/Heroin_-_Heroine.svg\/512px-Heroin_-_Heroine.svg.png","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":0,"name":"heroin","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heroin","latitude":null,"recent_count":0,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/heroin\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1330","woeid":null,"category":"Product","ping_category":[]},{"id":8719,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/8719\/","slug":"media","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <b>mass media<\/b> is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\").

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose.

Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","trend_rank_current":83,"image_height":592,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":83,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","item_count":13941,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":8,"name":"entertainment","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latitude":null,"recent_count":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Bshp","importance":2,"tweet":null,"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":20,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/20\/","username":"tom.mcarthur","full_name":"Tom McArthur","is_staff":false,"email":"Tom.McArthur@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Tom","last_name":"McArthur"},"status":"published","content":"Angelina Jolie to sue the Daily Mail after it publishes video online which claims to show her addicted to heroin during the 1990s - @ITVNews","url_external_text":"Read more on www.itv.com","slug":"angelina-jolie-to-sue-the-daily-mail-after-it-publ","submitter":"editor","source":null,"data_type":null,"latitude":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/07\/11\/angelina-jolie-to-sue-the-daily-mail-after-it-publ","ping":null,"pushed":true,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.itv.com\/news\/2014-07-11\/angelina-jolie-to-sue-daily-mail-over-drugs-video\/","date":"2014-07-11T10:01:49.710102","url_text":"Read more on www.itv.com","data":null},{"id":397818,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/397818\/","url_domain":"recode.net","push_content":"Jon Steinberg, former COO of BuzzFeed, to run American version of the UK-based Daily Mail's Web site, MailOnline - @recode","media":null,"shortened_url":"http:\/\/on.recode.net\/1lDfwxC","updated_date":"2014-06-15T16:44:28.096939","note":null,"whoas":20,"local_url":"\/item\/2014\/06\/15\/jon-steinberg-former-coo-of-buzzfeed-to-run-amer","type":"text","date_ap":"Jun 15, 2014, 04:41 PM GMT","url":"http:\/\/recode.net\/2014\/06\/15\/former-buzzfeed-coo-jon-steinberg-lands-at-daily-mails-web-site\/","topics":[{"id":8719,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/8719\/","slug":"media","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p>The <b>mass media<\/b> is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

The books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, and sold more than 400 million copies. They have become the best-selling book series in history and been the basis for a series of films over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and maintained creative control by serving as a producer on the final instalment.<\/p>\n<p>Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International when she conceived the idea for the <i>Harry Potter<\/i> series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London in 1990. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband and relative poverty until she finished the first novel in the series, <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone<\/i>, in 1997. There were six sequels, the last, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<\/i>, in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written four books for adult readers, <i>The Casual Vacancy<\/i> (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction novels <i>The Cuckoo's Calling<\/i> (2013), <i>The Silkworm<\/i> (2014) and <i>Career of Evil<\/i> (2015).<\/p>\n<p>Rowling has lived a \"rags to riches\" life story, in which she progressed from living on state benefits to multi-millionaire status within five years. She is the United Kingdom's best-selling living author, with sales in excess of £238M. The 2016 <i>Sunday Times Rich List<\/i> estimated Rowling's fortune at £600 million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. <i>Time<\/i> magazine named her as a runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given her fans. In October 2010, Rowling was named the \"Most Influential Woman in Britain\" by leading magazine editors.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","trend_rank_current":1,"image_height":337,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.246535","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","item_count":104890,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6e\/Pentonvilleiso19.jpg\/512px-Pentonvilleiso19.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":51,"name":"crime & courts","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","latitude":null,"recent_count":13,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[{"aliases":["police","cop","riot","swat","fbi","raid"],"name":"Police activity","description":"Whenever you see the police responding to a call or at the scene","symbol":"🚔","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/ping_categories\/10\/","slug":"police-activity","id":10}]},{"id":75,"livevideo":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","slug":"entertainment","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","links":"","geohash":"","description":"<p><b>Entertainment<\/b> is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","trend_rank_current":83,"image_height":592,"kind":"vertical","muted_by_default":false,"local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","trend_rank_last":83,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","item_count":13941,"active":true,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","placetype":"","image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"visible":true,"daily_count":8,"name":"entertainment","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","latitude":null,"recent_count":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","woeid":null,"category":"Topic","ping_category":[]}],"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/BlFn","importance":3,"tweet":null,"sponsor":null,"longitude":null,"author":{"id":7,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","username":"tom.brew","full_name":"Tom Brew","is_staff":false,"email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Brew"},"status":"published","content":"Daily Mail apologizes, pays damages to J.K.
