	<p>The journalist <a href="BUharmsworth.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Harmsworth</a> decided to start a newspaper based on the style of newspapers published in the USA. By the time the first issue of the <i>Daily Mail</i> appeared for the first time on 4th May, 1896, over 65 dummy runs had taken place, at a cost of &#163;40,000. When published for the first time, the eight page newspaper cost only halfpenny. Slogans used to sell the newspaper included &quot;A Penny Newspaper for One Halfpenny&quot;, &quot;The Busy Man's Daily Newspaper&quot; and &quot;All the News in the Smallest Space&quot;. (1)</p>
	<p>Harmsworth made use of the latest technology. This included mechanical typesetting on a linotype machine. He also purchased three rotary printing machines. In the first edition Harmsworth explained how he could use these machines to produce the cheapest newspaper on the market: &quot;Our type is set by machinery, and we can produce many thousands of papers per hour cut, folded and if necessary with the pages pasted together. It is the use of these new inventions on a scale unprecedented in any English newspaper office that enables the <em>Daily Mail</em> to effect a saving of from 30 to 50 per cent and be sold for half the price of its contemporaries. That is the whole explanation of what would otherwise appear a mystery.&quot; (2)  It was later claimed that these machines could produce 200,000 copies of the newspaper per hour. (3) </p>
	<p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> was the first newspaper in Britain that catered for a new reading public that needed something simpler, shorter and more readable than those that had previously been available. One new innovation was the banner headline that went right across the page. Considerable space was given to sport and human interest stories. It was also the first newspaper to include a woman's section that dealt with issues such as fashions and cookery. Most importantly, all its news stories and articles were short. The first day it sold 397,215 copies, more than had ever been sold by any newspaper in one day before. (4) </p>
	<p>Harmsworth gained many of his ideas from America. He had been especially impressed by <a href="Jpulitzer.htm" class="ajax">Joseph Pulitzer</a>, the owner of the <i><a href="USAnyworld.htm" class="ajax">New York World</a></i>. He also concentrated on human-interest stories, scandal and sensational material. However, Pulitzer also promised to use the paper to expose corruption: &quot;We will always fight for progress and reform, never tolerate injustice or corruption, always fight demagogues of all parties, always oppose privileged classes and public plunderers, never lack sympathy with the poor, always remain devoted to the public welfare, never be satisfied with merely printing news, always be drastically independent, never be afraid to attack wrong, whether by predatory plutocracy or predatory poverty.&quot; (5) </p>
	<p>In order to do this Pulitzer pioneered the idea of <a href="Jinvestigative.htm" class="ajax">investigative reporting</a> that eventually became known as <a href="Jmuckraking.htm" class="ajax">muckraking</a>. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Evans" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harold Evans</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/American-Century-Politics-Illustrated-History/dp/0712665706/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367336593&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+American+Century" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The American Century: People, Power and Politics</em></a> (1998) has pointed out: &quot;Crooks in City Hall. Opium in children's cough syrup. Rats in the meat packing factory. Cruelty to child workers... Scandal followed scandal in the early 1900s as a new breed of writers investigated the evils of laissez-faire America... The muckrakers were the heart of Progressivism, that shifting coalition of sentiment striving to make the American dream come true in the machine age. Their articles, with facts borne out by subsequent commissions, were read passionately in new national mass-circulation magazines by millions of the fast-growing aspiring white-collar middle class.&quot; (6) </p>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth completely rejected this approach to journalism. &quot;Looking back, what it (the <em>Daily Mail</em>) lacked most noticeably was a social conscience... Alfred had no desire to start looking for social evils, and no need. What he had to keep in mind were the tastes of a new public that was becoming better educated and more prosperous, that wanted its rosebushes and tobacco and silk corsets and tasty dishes, that liked to wave a flag for the Queen and see foreigners slip on a banana skin.&quot; (7) </p>
	<p>One of his journalists, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Northcliffe-Diary-Tom-Clarke/dp/B0006D6JUG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1496083737&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Tom+Clarke+Northcliffe+Diary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom Clarke</a>, claimed that his newspaper was for people who were not as intelligent as they thought they were: &quot;Was one of the secrets of the <em>Daily Mail</em> success its play on the snobbishness of all of us? - all of us except the very rich and the very poor, to whom snobbishness is not important; for the rich have nothing to gain by it, and the poor have nothing to lose.&quot; (8) </p>
	<p>Harmsworth made full use of the latest developments in communications. Overseas news-gathering offices opened in New York and Paris were aided by advances in cable transmission speed at the General Post Office, which had reached 600 words per minute by 1896. He also exploited the expanding British railway system to distribute the newspaper to the home market so that people all over Britain could read the newspaper over their breakfasts. It has been claimed that the <em>Daily Mail</em> was the first truly national newspaper. (9) </p>
<section id="section1"><header><h5>The Daily Mail and the Conservative Party</h5></header>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth made it clear to the leaders of the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Party</a> that the newspaper would provide loyal support against the movement towards social change. <a href="PRbalfour.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Balfour</a>, the leader of the party in the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a>, sent a private letter to Harmsworth. &quot;Though it is impossible for me, for obvious reasons, to appear among the list of those who publish congratulatory comments in the columns of the <em>Daily Mail</em> perhaps you will allow me privately to express my appreciation of your new undertaking. That, if it succeeds, it will greatly conduce to the wide dissemination of sound political principles, I feel assured; and I cannot doubt, that it will succeed, knowing the skill, the energy, the resource, with which it is conducted. You have taken the lead in the newspaper enterprise, and both you and the Party are to be heartily congratulated.&quot; (10) </p>
	<p>In July 1896, Harmsworth asked a friend, Lady Bulkley, to write to <a href="PRsalisbury.htm" class="ajax">Robert Cecil</a>, 3rd Marquis of Salisbury, the new prime minister, suggesting that in return for supporting the Conservative Party, he should be rewarded with a baronetcy. The letter pointed out that as well as owning several pro-conservative newspapers he had recently established &quot;the Daily Mail... at a cost of near &pound;100,000&quot;. Salisbury refused but was willing to offer a knighthood instead. Harmsworth rejected the offer and commented that he was willing to wait for a baronetcy. (11) </p>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth was a passionate supporter of the <a href="British_Empire.htm" class="ajax">British Empire</a> and he is said to have idolised two men, <a href="PRchamberlainJ.htm" class="ajax">Joseph Camberlain</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cecil Rhodes</a>. He intended to use his newspaper and the rest of his publications to &quot;strum the Imperial harp&quot;. According to <a href="http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n89644117/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Harry J. Greenwall</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Northcliffe-Napoleon-Fleet-Street-Greenwall/dp/B001K83NI2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495735233&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Northcliffe%3A+Napoleon+of+Fleet+Street" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Northcliffe: Napoleon of Fleet Street</em></a> (1957) Harmsworth &quot;with the <em>Daily Mail</em> unleashed a tremendous force of potential mass thought-control&quot; as it became the &quot;trumpet... of British Imperialism.&quot; (12) </p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._W._Steevens" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">George W. Steevens</a> was one of those who heard Harmsworth speak on the subject of Rhodes: &quot;I met last night perhaps the most remarkable man I have ever seen... It is Harmsworth... He is very young and his speech showed that he rates Rhodes too high. Rhodes is as strong as Bismarck, and youth rates strength too high, but Rhodes was never sharp and has become stupid. Harmsworth himself is superior, in that he is probably both strong and sharp.&quot; (13) </p>
	<p>On the sixtieth anniversary of Queen <a href="PRvictoria.htm" class="ajax">Victoria</a> coming to the throne <a href="BUharmsworth.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Harmsworth</a>  wrote: &quot;We ought to be a proud nation today. Proud of our fathers that founded this Empire, proud of ourselves who have... increased it, proud of our sons, who we can trust to keep what we had... and increase it for their sons in turn and their son's sons. Until we saw it (the great pageant) all passing through our city we never quite realised what Europe meant... It makes life newly worth living... better and more strenuously to feel that one is a part of this enormous, this wonderful machine, the greatest organisation the world ever saw.&quot; (14) </p>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth became very concerned about the dangers posed by <a href="FWWinGermany.htm" class="ajax">Germany</a>. He sent his leading journalist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._W._Steevens" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">George W. Steevens</a>, to report on the country: &quot;The German army is the most perfectly adapted, perfectly running machine. Never can there have been a more signal triumph of organization over complexity... The German army is the finest thing thing of its kind in the world; it is the finest thing in Germany of any kind... In the German army the men are ready, and the planes, the railway-carriages, the gas for the war-balloons, and the nails for the horseshoes are all ready too... Nothing overlooked, nothing neglected, everything practised, everything welded together, and yet everything alive and fighting... And what should we ever do if 100,000 of this kind of army got loose in England?&quot; (15) </p>

	<p>Harmsworth became convinced that Britain would have to go to war with Germany and urged the government to increase its spending on defence: &quot;This is our hour of preparation, tomorrow may be the day of world conflict... Germany will go slowly and surely; she is not in a hurry: her preparations are quietly and systematically made; it is no part of her object to cause general alarm which might be fatal to her designs.&quot; (16) </p>
	<p>In an interview Harmsworth gave to a French newspaper he explained his views on Germany: &quot;Yes, we detest the Germans, we detest them cordially and the make themselves detested by all of Europe. I will not permit the least thing that might injure France to appear in my paper, but I should not like for anything to appear in it that might be agreeable to Germany.&quot; (17) </p>
</section><section id="section2"><header><h5>The Boer War </h5></header>
	<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boers</a> (Dutch settlers in South Africa), under the leadership of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kruger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Kruger</a>, resented the colonial policy of <a href="PRchamberlainJ.htm" class="ajax">Joseph Chamberlain</a> and <a href="PRmilner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Milner</a> which they feared would deprive the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Republic" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Transvaal</a> of its independence. After receiving military equipment from Germany, the Boers had a series of successes on the borders of Cape Colony and Natal between October 1899 and January 1900. Although the Boers only had 88,000 soldiers, led by the outstanding soldiers such as <a href="FWWbotha.htm" class="ajax">Louis Botha</a>, and <a href="FWWsmuts.htm" class="ajax">Jan Smuts</a>, the Boers were able to successfully besiege the British garrisons at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Ladysmithl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ladysmith</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mafeking</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kimberley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kimberley</a>. On the outbreak of the <a href="WARboer.htm" class="ajax">Boer War</a>, the conservative government announced a national emergency and sent in extra troops. (18) </p>
	<p>On 25th July, 1900, a motion on the Boer War, caused a three way split in the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a>. A total of 40 "Liberal Imperialists" that included <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a>, <a href="FWWgrey.htm" class="ajax">Edward Grey</a>, <a href="TUhaldane.htm" class="ajax">Richard Haldane</a> and <a href="PRrosebery.htm" class="ajax">Archibald Primrose</a>, Lord Rosebery, supported the government's policy in South Africa. <a href="PRbannerman.htm" class="ajax">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a> and 34 others abstained, whereas 31 Liberals, led by <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a>, voted against the motion.</p>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth, a strong supporter of the war, saw this as an opportunity to damage the Liberal Party. A series of articles appeared in the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Mail</em></a> that questioned the patriotism of people like David Lloyd George. The old-fashioned &quot;Little Englander&quot; position, said the newspaper, by sympathizing with the enemy in the South African crisis, had failed to interpret the sentiment of the nation for &quot;England and Empire&quot;. According to Harmsworth, for the Liberal Party to survive, its only hope was to regain the trust of the country by supporting the band of thirty or so Liberal Imperialists, led by Rosebery, Asquith and Grey.&quot; (19)</p>
<figure><img src="00mailD2.jpg" width="444" height="636" alt="The Daily Mail (19th May, 1900)" /><figcaption>                      The Daily Mail (19th May, 1900) </figcaption></figure>
	<p><a href="PRsalisbury.htm" class="ajax">Robert Cecil</a>, the Marquess of Salisbury, decided to take advantage of the divided Liberal Party and on 25th September 1900, he dissolved Parliament and called a general election. Lloyd George, admitted in one speech he was in a minority but it was his duty as a member of the House of Commons to give his constituents honest advice. He went on to make an attack on Tory jingoism. "The man who tries to make the flag an object of a single party is a greater traitor to that flag than the man who fires upon it." (20) </p>
	<p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> supported both the Conservatives and the Liberal Unionists in the election. Harmsworth had developed a close relationship with <a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a>, who was attempting to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldham_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Oldham</a> for the imperial cause. Churchill proclaimed the opponents of the government the enemies of Britain and the Empire. He claimed on one poster: &quot;Be it known that every vote given to the radicals means two pats on the back for Kruger and two smacks in the face for our country&quot;. (21) </p>
	<p><a href="PRbannerman.htm" class="ajax">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a> with a difficult task of holding together the strongly divided Liberal Party and they were badly defeated in the <a href="GE1900.htm" class="ajax">1900 General Election</a>. The <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Party</a> won 402 seats against the 183 achieved by Liberal Party. However, anti-war MPs did better than those who defended the war. <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> increased the size of his majority in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caernarfon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Caernarvon Borough</a>. Other anti-war MPs such as <a href="Henry_Labouchere.htm" class="ajax">Henry Labouchere</a> and <a href="REburns.htm" class="ajax">John Burns</a> both increased their majorities. </p>
	<p>The <a href="WARboer.htm" class="ajax">Boer War</a> proved to be very popular with the British public. In 1898 the <i><a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax">Daily Mail</a></i> was selling 400,000 copies a day. Harmsworth encouraged people to buy the <em>newspaper </em>for nationalistic reasons making it clear to his readers that his newspaper stood &quot;for the power, the supremacy and the greatness of the British Empire&quot;. By 1899 it had reached 600,000 and during the most dramatic moments of the war in 1900 it was almost a million and a half. However, after the war, circulation fell to 700,000. (22) </p>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth had a patronising and sententious attitude towards women: &quot;Nine women out of ten would rather read about an evening dress costing a great deal of money - the sort of dress they will never in their lives have a chance of wearing, than about a simple frock such as they could afford. A recipe for a dish requiring a pint of cream, a dozen eggs, and the breasts of three chickens pleases them better than being told how to make Irish stew.&quot; (23) </p>
</section><section id="section3"><header><h5>Lord Northcliffe </h5></header>
	<p>In April 1905, <a href="BUharmsworth.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Harmsworth</a>, established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMG_Media" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Associated Newspapers Limited</a> with a capital of &pound;1,600,000, the shares of which swiftly sold out. His income for the year was &pound;115,000. Apart from his newspaper business he had other stock worth &pound;300,000. Despite his growing wealth he was still dissatisfied and craved titles and acceptance from the ruling class. (24) </p>
	<p>On 23rd June, it was announced that Harmsworth had received a baronetcy. <a href="Jtelegraph.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a> reported that it was unusual for a man &quot;to win so much success in so limited a time&quot;. (25) Those newspapers that supported the Liberal Party were less complimentary. <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Chronicle</em></a> stated that &quot;Mr. Harmsworth's is the name of the most general interest in a list that is more remarkable for quantity than quality&quot;. (26) The most bitter comment came from <a href="Jnews.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily News</em></a>, &quot;having been conspicuously passed over for several years, Sir Alfred Harmsworth has arrived at his baronetcy... for all he did during the Boer War.&quot; (27) </p>
	<p><a href="PRbalfour.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Balfour</a> resigned as prime minister on 4th December 1905 and was replaced by <a href="PRbannerman.htm" class="ajax">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>, the leader of the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a>. Before he went he asked <a href="MOedwardVII.htm" class="ajax">Edward VII</a> if he would give Alfred Harmsworth a peerage. The Chief Whip, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fuller-Acland-Hood,_1st_Baron_St_Audries" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alexander Acland-Hood</a>, believed that if this did not happen, Harmsworth would change his support to the Liberals: &quot;If he doesn't get it now he will get it when Cambell-Bannerman makes his Peers on taking office - we should then lose all his money and influence - I very much dislike the business, but as we can't stop it in the future why make so handsome a present to the other side!&quot; (28) </p>
	<p><aside id="ad5"></aside></p>
	<p>Alfred Harmsworth took the title, Lord Northcliffe. Balfour told him that he was &quot;the youngest peer&quot; in British history. It was a very controversial decision and many considered it an act of corruption. A few years earlier Harmsworth had commented that &quot;when I want a peerage I will pay for it&quot; and that is what a lot of people thought had happened. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Stern,_1st_Baron_Michelham" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Herbert Stern</a>, a banker, was also accused of buying the title, Lord Michelham. (29) </p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Review_(London)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Saturday Review</em></a> published a long article on Balfour's resignation list. Is it true or false that the peerages of Michelham and Northcliffe were sold for so much cash down? And did the cash go into the war-chest of the Conservative party? That these peerages were conferred for a sincere belief in the public merits of the recipients or from any other mercenary considerations is plainly incredible... Beginning the world with nothing he (Northcliffe) has made a very large fortune by the production of certain newspapers. No man makes a pile without the possession of certain qualities, which are obviously rare, but which do not in our opinion necessarily entitle their possessors to a seat in the House of Lords... We say advisedly that he has done more than any man of his generation to pervert and enfeeble the mind of the multitude.&quot; (30) </p>
	<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-alfred-gollin-327139.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alfred Gollin</a> has argued that there were other reasons why some people objected to him becoming a member of the <a href="Plords.htm" class="ajax">House of Lords</a>: &quot;A chief source of the hostility that confronted him lay in the fact that he (Alfred Harmsworth) was so different from the other members of the ruling class of his time. They resented his power, his influence, his ability, and most of all, his refusal to conform to their standards... the established classes were hostile to Lord Northcliffe because he came from a different background, because he had clawed his way to the top, because he was required, as an outsider, to have recourse to different methods when he sought to clutch at authority and grasp for power. The ordinary rulers of Britain were ruthless enough but a man of Northcliffe's type had to be harder, tougher, more openly brutal, or else he would perish&quot;. (31) </p>
	<p><a href="PRbannerman.htm" class="ajax">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a> called a general election and on 21st December, 1905, he made pledges to support <a href="Irish_Home_Rule.htm" class="ajax">Irish Home Rule</a>, to cut defence spending, to repeal the <a href="Leducation1902.htm" class="ajax">1902 Education Act</a>, to oppose food taxes and slavery in South Africa. <em>The Daily Mail</em> reported that the Liberal Party intended to &quot;attack capital, assail private enterprise, undo the Union, reverse the Education Act, cripple the one industry of South Africa, reduce the navy and weaken the army.&quot; It went on to say that if the Liberals won power it would bring a halt to the growth of the <a href="British_Empire.htm" class="ajax">British Empire</a>. (32) </p>
	<p>During the campaign members of the <a href="Wwspu.htm" class="ajax">Women Social &amp; Political Union</a> attempted to disrupt political meetings. On 10th January, 1906, <em>The Daily Mail</em> described these women as &quot;suffragettes&quot;. It was meant as an insult but <a href="WpankhurstE.htm" class="ajax">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, the leader of the organisation, liked the term and defiantly accepted the label. Lord Northcliffe, was totally opposed to women having the vote and ordered his editors to ignore their activities. (33) </p>

	<p>In the <a href="GE1906.htm" class="ajax">1906 General Election</a> the Liberal Party won 397 seats (48.9%) compared to the Conservative Party's 156 seats (43.4%). The <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a>, led by <a href="PRhardie.htm" class="ajax">Keir Hardie</a> did well, increasing their seats from 2 to 29. In the landslide victory <a href="PRbalfour.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Balfour</a> lost his seat as did most of his cabinet ministers. <a href="FWWasquithM.htm" class="ajax">Margot Asquith</a> wrote: "When the final figures of the Elections were published everyone was stunned, and it certainly looks as if it were the end of the great Tory Party as we have known it." (34) </p>
	<p>Balfour considered the growth in the vote for Labour a significant factor in the result.&quot;I am quite confident that there are much deeper causes at work than those with which, for the last 20 years, we have been familiar. I regard the enormous increase in the Labour vote (an increase which cannot be measured merely by the number returned of Labour members so-called) as a reflection in this country - faint I hope - of what is going on the Continent; and, if so, 1906 will be remarkable for something much more important than the fall of a Government which has been ten years in office.&quot; (35)</p>
	<p>One of the innovations introduced by the <i>Daily Mail</i> was the publication of serials. Personally supervised by Northcliffe, the average length was 100,000 words. The opening episode was 5,000 words and had to have a dramatic impact on the readers. This was followed by episodes of 1,500 to 2,000 words every day. On 19th March 1906, the newspaper published the first installment of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias=stripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+Invasion+of+1910&amp;rh=n%3A266239,k%3AThe+Invasion+of+1910" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Invasion of 1910</em></a>, in which the novelist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Le_Queux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">William Le Queux</a>, detailed a German invasion of Britain. </p>
	<p>This was all part of Lord Northcliffe's campaign to build up Britain's defences against Germany. He was a great supporter of the need to build up the British Navy to protect the country from a German invasion. Britain's first <a href="FWWdreadnought.htm" class="ajax">dreadnought</a> was built at <a href="ITportsmouth.htm" class="ajax">Portsmouth Dockyard</a> between October 1905 and December 1906. It was the most heavily-armed ship in history. She had ten 12-inch guns (305 mm), whereas the previous record was four 12-inch guns. The gun turrets were situated higher than user and so facilitated more accurate long-distance fire. In addition to her 12-inch guns, the ship also had twenty-four 3-inch guns (76 mm) and five torpedo tubes below water. In the waterline section of her hull, the ship was armoured by plates 28 cm thick. It was the first major warship driven solely by steam turbines. It was also faster than any other warship and could reach speeds of 21 knots. A total of 526 feet long (160.1 metres) it had a crew of over 800 men. It cost over &pound;2 million, twice as much as the cost of a conventional battleship. </p>
<figure><img src="00dreadnought.jpg" width="500" height="377" alt="HMS Dreadnought (1906)" /><figcaption>                      HMS Dreadnought (1906)</figcaption></figure>
	<p>Germany built its first dreadnought in 1907 and plans were made for building more. The British government believed it was necessary to have twice the number of these warships than any other navy. <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> had a meeting with the German Ambassador, Count <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wolff_Metternich" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Paul Metternich</a>, and told him that Britain was willing to spend &pound;100 million to frustrate Germany's plans to achieve naval supremacy. That night he made a speech where he spoke out on the arms race: &quot;My principle is, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, less money for the production of suffering, more money for the reduction of suffering.&quot; (36) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe, used his newspapers to urge an increase in defence spending and a reduction in the amount of money being spent on social insurance schemes. In one letter to Lloyd George he suggested that the Liberal government was Pro-German. Lloyd George replied: &quot;The only real pro-German whom I know of on the Liberal side of politics is Rosebery, and I sometimes wonder whether he is even a Liberal at all! Haldane, of course, from education and intellectual bent, is in sympathy with German ideas, but there is really nothing else on which to base a suspicion that we are inclined to a pro-German policy at the expense of the entente with France.&quot; (37) </p>
	<p>Northcliffe's propaganda campaign was helped by the purchase of <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> newspaper on 16th March 1908 for &pound;320,000, following a complex financial and political campaign in which he outmanoeuvred his rival, <a href="BUpearson.htm" class="ajax">C. Arthur Pearson</a>. He always claimed that he allowed the paper its full independence but he made sure that the senior staff agreed with him on the current political issues, especially, military spending. (38) </p>
</section><section id="section5"><header><h5>The Daily Mail and the Welfare State </h5></header>
	<p><a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> was the leading radical in the Liberal government. in one speech had warned that if the government did not pass progressive measures, at the next election, the working-class would vote for the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a>: "If at the end of our term of office it were found that the present Parliament had done nothing to cope seriously with the social condition of the people, to remove the national degradation of slums and widespread poverty and destitution in a land glittering with wealth, if they do not provide an honourable sustenance for deserving old age, if they tamely allow the House of Lords to extract all virtue out of their bills, so that when the Liberal statute book is produced it is simply a bundle of sapless legislative faggots fit only for the fire - then a new cry will arise for a land with a new party, and many of us will join in that cry." (39) </p>
	<p>Lloyd George had been a long opponent of the <a href="Lpoor1834.htm" class="ajax">Poor Law</a> in Britain. He was determined to take action that in his words would "lift the shadow of the workhouse from the homes of the poor". He believed the best way of doing this was to guarantee an income to people who were to old to work. Based on the ideas of <a href="PRpaine.htm" class="ajax">Tom Paine</a> that first appeared in his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_b?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Rights+of+Man&amp;x=18&amp;y=19" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rights of Man</a></em>, Lloyd George's proposed the introduction of <a href="Lold.htm" class="ajax">old age pensions</a>. </p>
	<p>In a speech on 15th June 1908, he pointed out: "You have never had a scheme of this kind tried in a great country like ours, with its thronging millions, with its rooted complexities... This is, therefore, a great experiment... We do not say that it deals with all the problem of unmerited destitution in this country. We do not even contend that it deals with the worst part of that problem. It might be held that many an old man dependent on the charity of the parish was better off than many a young man, broken down in health, or who cannot find a market for his labour." (40) </p>
	<p>To pay for these pensions Lloyd George had to raise government revenues by an additional &pound;16 million a year. In 1909 Lloyd George announced what became known as the <a href="Peoples_Budget.htm" class="ajax">People's Budget</a>. This included increases in taxation. Whereas people on lower incomes were to pay 9d. in the pound, those on annual incomes of over &pound;3,000 had to pay 1s. 2d. in the pound. Lloyd George also introduced a new super-tax of 6d. in the pound for those earning &pound;5,000 a year. Other measures included an increase in death duties on the estates of the rich and heavy taxes on profits gained from the ownership and sale of property. Other innovations in Lloyd George's budget included labour exchanges and a children's allowance on income tax. (41) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe disliked the idea of paying higher taxes in order to help provide old age pensions and used all of his newspapers to criticize the measures in the budget. <a href="Jnews.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily News</em></a> launched an attack on the wealthy men opposed to the budget: &quot;It is they who own the newspapers, and when we remember that <em>The Times</em>, <em>The Daily Mail</em>, and <em>The Observer</em>, not to mention a host of minor organs in London and the provinces, are all controlled by one man, it is easy to realise how vast a political power capital exerts by this means alone.&quot; (42) </p>
	<p>One of David Lloyd George's main supporters was <a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a>, who spoke at a large number of public meetings on this issue. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/723785.Robert_Lloyd_George" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robert Lloyd George</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Robert+Lloyd+George%2C+David+%26+Winston&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3ARobert+Lloyd+George%5Cc+David+%26+Winston" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>David &amp; Winston: How a Friendship Changed History</em></a> (2005) has suggested that their main motive was to prevent <a href="socialism.htm" class="ajax">socialism</a> in Britain: "Churchill and Lloyd George intuitively saw the real danger of socialism in the global situation of that time, when economic classes were so divided. In other European countries, revolution would indeed sweep away monarchs and landlords within the next ten years. But thanks to the reforming programme of the pre-war Liberal government, Britain evolved peacefully towards a more egalitarian society. It is arguable that the peaceful revolution of the People's Budget prevented a much more bloody revolution." (43) </p>
	<p>The <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservatives</a>, who had a large majority in the <a href="Plords.htm" class="ajax">House of Lords</a>, objected to this attempt to redistribute wealth, and made it clear that they intended to block these proposals. Lloyd George reacted by touring the country making speeches in working-class areas on behalf of the budget and portraying the nobility as men who were using their privileged position to stop the poor from receiving their <a href="Lold.htm" class="ajax">old age pensions</a>. The historian, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dangerfield" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">George Dangerfield</a>, has argued that Lloyd George had created a budget that would destroy the House of Lords if they tried to block the legislation: "It was like a kid, which sportsmen tie up to a tree in order to persuade a tiger to its death." (44) </p>

	<p> On 30th November, 1909, the Peers rejected the Finance Bill by 350 votes to 75. <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> had no option but to call a general election. In <a href="GE1910.htm" class="ajax">January 1910</a>, the Liberals lost votes and was forced to rely on the support of the 42 <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party </a>MPs to govern. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grigg,_2nd_Baron_Altrincham" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">John Grigg</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=John+Grigg%2C+The+People%27s+Champion&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3AJohn+Grigg%5Cc+The+People%27s+Champion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The People's Champion</em></a> (1978) argues that the reason why the "people failed to give a sweeping, massive endorsement to the People's Budget" was that the electorate in 1910 was "by no means representative of the whole British nation". He points out that "only 58 per cent of adult males had the vote, and it is a fair assumption that the remaining 42 per cent would, if enfranchised, have voted in very large numbers for Liberal or Labour candidates. In what was still a disproportionately middle-class electorate the fear of Socialism was strong, and many voters were susceptible to the argument that the Budget was a first installment of Socialism." (45) </p>
	<p>The historian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/21/duncan-tanner-obituary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Duncan Tanner</a>, believes that Lord Northcliffe played an important role in the election. Although the the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a> had the support of two popular national newspapers, the <a href="Jnews.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily News</em></a> and the <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Chronicle</em></a>, they found it difficult to compete with the influence of Northcliffe's <i>Daily Mail</i>. Tanner has pointed out: &quot;They were enthusiastically progressive. They sensationally exposed poverty, making 'political' comparisons between the 'immoral' and 'extreme' wealth of Tory plutocrats and the landlords on the one hand, and the acute and total distress of the poor on the other. Yet between them they had less than three-quarters of a million readers in 1910 (less than the Tory <em>Daily Mail</em> alone).&quot; (46)</p>
<figure><img src="00harms7.jpg" width="400" height="431" alt="Lord Northcliffe and Geoffrey Dawson" /><figcaption>                       <a href="BUharmsworth.htm" class="ajax">Lord Northcliffe</a> (c.1910)</figcaption></figure>
	<p>The circulation of the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Mail</em></a> in 1910 was 900,000. This gave them the advantage over <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Chronicle</em></a> (800,000), <a href="Jsketch.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Sketch</em></a> (750,000), <a href="Jmirror.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mirror</em></a> (630,000), <a href="Jexpress.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Express</em></a> (400,000), <a href="Jtelegraph.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a> (230,000), <a href="Jmorning.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Morning Post</em></a> (50,000), <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> (45,000) and <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Manchester Guardian</em></a> (40,000). (46a) </p>
	<p><a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> became convinced that Britain needed a health insurance scheme similar to one introduced in Germany in the 1880s. Lloyd George presented his national insurance proposal to the Cabinet at the beginning of April, 1911. &quot;Insurance was to be made compulsory for all regularly employed workers over the age of sixteen and with incomes below the level - &pound;160 a year - of liability for income tax; also for all manual labourers, whatever their income. The rates of contribution would be 4d. a week from a man, and 3d. a week from a woman; 3d. a week from his or her employer; and 2d. a week from the State.&quot; (47) </p>
	<p>The <a href="Linsurance1911.htm" class="ajax">National Insurance Bill</a> was introduced into the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a> on 4th May, 1911. Lloyd George argued: &quot;It is no use shirking the fact that a proportion of workmen with good wages spend them in other ways, and therefore have nothing to spare with which to pay premiums to friendly societies. It has come to my notice, in many of these cases, that the women of the family make most heroic efforts to keep up the premiums to the friendly societies, and the officers of friendly societies, whom I have seen, have amazed me by telling the proportion of premiums of this kind paid by women out of the very wretched allowance given them to keep the household together.&quot;</p>
	<p>Lloyd George went on to explain: &quot;When a workman falls ill, if he has no provision made for him, he hangs on as long as he can and until he gets very much worse. Then he goes to another doctor (i.e. not to the Poor Law doctor) and runs up a bill, and when he gets well he does his very best to pay that and the other bills. He very often fails to do so. I have met many doctors who have told me that they have hundreds of pounds of bad debts of this kind which they could not think of pressing for payment of, and what really is done now is that hundreds of thousands - I am not sure that I am not right in saying millions - of men, women and children get the services of such doctors. The heads of families get those services at the expense of the food of their children, or at the expense of good-natured doctors.&quot;</p>
	<p>Lloyd George stated this measure was just the start to government involvement in protecting people from social evils: &quot;I do not pretend that this is a complete remedy. Before you get a complete remedy for these social evils you will have to cut in deeper. But I think it is partly a remedy. I think it does more. It lays bare a good many of those social evils, and forces the State, as a State, to pay attention to them. It does more than that... till the advent of a complete remedy, this scheme does alleviate an immense mass of human suffering, and I am going to appeal, not merely to those who support the Government in this House, but to the House as a whole, to the men of all parties, to assist us.&quot; (48) </p>
	<p><a href="PRsundayobserver.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Observer</em></a> welcomed the legislation as &quot;by far the largest and best project of social reform ever yet proposed by a nation. It is magnificent in temper and design&quot;. (49) <a href="http://www.bmj.com/archive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The British Medical Journal</em></a> described the proposed bill as &quot;one of the greatest attempts at social legislation which the present generation has known&quot; and it seemed that it was &quot;destined to have a profound influence on social welfare.&quot; (50) </p>
	<p>Lloyd George's reforms were strongly criticised and some <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservatives</a> accused him of being a <a href="socialism.htm" class="ajax">socialist</a>. There was no doubt that he had been heavily influenced by <a href="Pfabian.htm" class="ajax">Fabian Society</a> pamphlets on social reform that had been written by <a href="TUwebbB.htm" class="ajax">Beatrice Webb</a>, <a href="TUwebbS.htm" class="ajax">Sidney Webb</a> and <a href="Jshaw.htm" class="ajax">George Bernard Shaw</a>. However, some Fabians &quot;feared that the Trade Unions might now be turned into Insurance Societies, and that their leaders would be further distracted from their industrial work.&quot; (51) </p>
	<p>Lloyd George pointed out that the labour movement in Germany had initially opposed national insurance: &quot;In Germany, the trade union movement was a poor, miserable, wretched thing some years ago. Insurance has done more to teach the working class the virtue of organisation than any single thing. You cannot get a socialist leader in Germany today to do anything to get rid of that Bill... Many socialist leaders in Germany will say that they would rather have our Bill than their own.&quot; (52) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe, launched a propaganda campaign against the bill on the grounds that the scheme would be too expensive for small employers. The climax of the campaign was a rally in the Albert Hall on 29th November, 1911. As Lord Northcliffe, controlled 40 per cent of the morning newspaper circulation in Britain, 45 per cent of the evening and 15 per cent of the Sunday circulation, his views on the subject was very important. </p>
	<p> <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> was very concerned about the impact of the <em>The Daily Mail</em> involvement in this issue: &quot;<em>The Daily Mail</em> has been engineering a particularly unscrupulous campaign on behalf of mistresses and maids and one hears from all constituencies of defections from our party of the small class of employers. There can be no doubt that the Insurance Bill is (to say the least) not an electioneering asset.&quot; (53) </p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Owen_(politician)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Frank Owen</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Frank+Owen%2C+Tempestuous+Journey%3A+Lloyd+George+and+his+Life+and+Times&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3AFrank+Owen%5Cc+Tempestuous+Journey%3A+Lloyd+George+and+his+Life+and+Times" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tempestuous Journey: Lloyd George and his Life and Times</em></a> (1954) suggested that it was those who employed servants who were the most hostile to the legislation: &quot;Their tempers were inflamed afresh each morning by Northcliffe's <em>Daily Mail</em>, which alleged that inspectors would invade their drawing-rooms to check if servants' cards were stamped, while it warned the servants that their mistresses would sack them the moment they became liable for sickness benefit.&quot; (54) </p>
	<p>The National Insurance Bill spent 29 days in committee and grew in length and complexity from 87 to 115 clauses. These amendments were the result of pressure from insurance companies, Friendly Societies, the medical profession and the trade unions, which insisted on becoming &quot;approved&quot; administers of the scheme. The bill was passed by the House of Commons on 6th December and received royal assent on 16th December 1911. (55) </p>

	<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> and <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>, both owned by Lord Northcliffe, continued its campaign against the <a href="Linsurance1911.htm" class="ajax">National Insurance Act</a> and urged its readers who were employers not to pay their national health contributions. David Lloyd George asked: &quot;Were there now to be two classes of citizens in the land - one class which could obey the laws if they liked; the other, which must obey whether they liked it or not? Some people seemed to think that the Law was an institution devised for the protection of their property, their lives, their privileges and their sport it was purely a weapon to keep the working classes in order. This Law was to be enforced. But a Law to ensure people against poverty and misery and the breaking-up of home through sickness or unemployment was to be optional.&quot; (56) </p>
	<p>Lloyd George attacked the newspaper baron for encouraging people to break the law and compared the issue to the foot-and-mouth plague rampant in the countryside at the time: &quot;Defiance of the law is like the cattle plague. It is very difficult to isolate it and confine it to the farm where it has broken out. Although this defiance of the Insurance Act has broken out first among the Harmsworth herd, it has travelled to the office of <em>The Times</em>. Why? Because they belong to the same cattle farm. <em>The Times</em>, I want you to remember, is just a twopenny-halfpenny edition of <em>The Daily Mail</em>.&quot; (57)</p>
	<p>One of his journalists, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/My-Northcliffe-Diary-Tom-Clarke/dp/B0006D6JUG/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1496083737&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Tom+Clarke+Northcliffe+Diary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tom Clarke</a>, pointed out that Lord Northcliffe dictated the political stance of his newspaper:  &quot;He (Northcliffe) was sometimes violent in both speech and action (once in his office he took a flying kick at the seat of the pants of a man who had annoyed him; and on another occasion put his foot through a man's hat in his temper). He seldom sought advice, and treated it so roughly if he did not like it, that people hesitated to give it him. When he spoke, everybody else listened, usually without challenge. He suffered from little opposition.&quot; (58) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe used his newspapers to oppose women having the vote. He ordered his newspapers to ignore the subject as he believed any publicity only helped their cause. On a visit to Canada and the United States he proudly pointed out that newspapers in those countries had more information on the activities of the <a href="Wnuwss.htm" class="ajax">National Union of Suffrage Societies</a> and the <a href="Wwspu.htm" class="ajax">Women Social &amp; Political Union</a> than the ones controlled by him. (59) </p>
	<p>However, he thought it wise not to give his opinions in public as he feared it would lose him readers: &quot;My view of the position of newspaper owners is that they should be read and not seen. The less they appear in person the better for the influence of their newspapers. That is why I never appear on public platforms. As to the woman's suffrage business, I am one of those people who believe the whole thing to be a bubble, blown by a few wealthy women who employ their less prosperous sisters to do the work. I judge public interest in the matter by the correspondence received. We never get any letters apart from those from the stage army of suffragettes.&quot; (60) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe was also extremely hostile to trade unions. One of his journalists remembered how he behaved during a strike organised by the National Union of Mineworkers: &quot;During this coal strike the orders came thick and fast. Whatever he might do through <em>The Times</em> in the way of influencing public opinion, he could do far more through the Mail, with its millions... He thought mob rule might be coming, so the mob must be divided; the public must be shown how the miners were enjoying themselves at the seaside or dog races while helpless workers in other industries suffered from the creeping paralysis.&quot; (61) </p>

	<p>Lord Northcliffe had consistently described Germany as Britain's &quot;secret and insidious enemy&quot;, and he commissioned <a href="Jblatchford.htm" class="ajax">Robert Blatchford</a>, to visit Germany and then write a series of articles setting out the dangers. The German's, Blatchford wrote, were making &quot;gigantic preparations&quot; to destroy the British Empire and &quot;to force German dictatorship upon the whole of Europe&quot;. He complained that Britain was not prepared for was and argued that the country was facing the possibility of an &quot;Armageddon&quot;. (62) </p>
	<p>He continued to demand that the government to spend more money on building up the British Navy. In this he gained the support of <a href="PRmckenna.htm" class="ajax">Reginald McKenna</a>, the First Lord of the Admiralty, <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a>, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was totally opposed to this policy. He reminded <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> of &quot;the emphatic pledges given by us before and during the general election campaign to reduce the gigantic expenditure on armaments built up by our predecessors... but if Tory extravagance on armaments is seen to be exceeded, Liberals... will hardly think it worth their while to make any effort to keep in office a Liberal ministry... the Admiralty's proposals were a poor compromise between two scares - fear of the German navy abroad and fear of the Radical majority at home... You alone can save us from the prospect of squalid and sterile destruction.&quot; (63) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe was highly critical of a Liberal government who were more willing to spend more money on the emerging welfare state than on defence spending. In the 1910 General Election he accused the government of &quot;surrendering to socialism&quot; and that it was the patriotic duty of the British people to vote for the Conservative Party as Germany wanted a Liberal victory in the election. (64) </p>
	<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> campaigned for the introduction of <a href="FWWconscription.htm" class="ajax">military conscription</a> to deal with the threat of Germany. It argued that &quot;in recent years&quot; no other subject &quot;has attracted more attention, has aroused more discussion, or been followed by our readers with closer interest&quot;. It also published a pamphlet that dealt with this issue. Within a few weeks it sold over 1,600,000 copies. <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Manchester Guardian</em></a> accused the newspaper of &quot;deliberately raking the fires of hell for votes&quot;. (65) </p>
	<p>In January 1911, Lord Northcliffe met <a href="Geoffrey_Dawson.htm" class="ajax">Geoffrey Dawson</a>, who had worked very closely with Sir <a href="PRmilner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Milner</a> in establishing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table_movement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Round Table</a>. According to <a href="http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/faculty/staff/profile/may.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alexander May</a>, &quot;The aim of the Round Table was deceptively simple: to ensure the permanence of the British empire by reconstructing it as a federation representative of all its self-governing parts. Curtis depicted this as the logical outcome of the movement towards self-government in the dominions, and the only alternative to disruption and independence.&quot; Northcliffe agreed with Dawson's views on the <a href="British_Empire.htm" class="ajax">British Empire</a> and appointed him as a full-time staff member of <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a><em>.</em> He was invited to Northcliffe's Tudor mansion near Guildford. The two men, who were &quot;strong Imperialists&quot; got on very well. Northcliffe told a friend that Dawson would one day be &quot;a future editor of <em>The Times</em>.&quot; (66) </p>

	<p><a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> was constantly in conflict with <a href="PRmckenna.htm" class="ajax">Reginald McKenna</a>, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and suggested to <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> that his friend, <a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a>, should become First Lord of the Admiralty. Asquith took this advice and Churchill was appointed to the post on 24th October, 1911. McKenna, with the greatest reluctance, replaced him at the Home Office. This move backfired on Lloyd George as the Admiralty cured Churchill's passion for &quot;economy&quot;. The &quot;new ruler of the King's navy demanded an expenditure on new battleships which made McKenna's claims seem modest&quot;. (67) </p>
	<p>The Admiralty reported to the British government that by 1912 Germany would have 17 dreadnoughts, three-fourths the number planned by Britain for that date. At a cabinet meeting David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill both expressed doubts about the veracity of the Admiralty intelligence. Churchill even accused Admiral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher,_1st_Baron_Fisher" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">John Fisher</a>, who had provided this information, of applying pressure on naval attach&eacute;s in Europe to provide any sort of data he needed. (68) </p>
	<p>Admiral Fisher refused to be beaten and contacted King <a href="MOedwardVII.htm" class="ajax">Edward VII</a> about his fears. He in turn discussed the issue with <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a>. Lloyd George wrote to Churchill explaining how Asquith had now given approval to Fisher's proposals: &quot;I feared all along this would happen. Fisher is a very clever person and when he found his programme in danger he wired Davidson (assistant private secretary to the King) for something more panicky - and of course he got it.&quot; (69) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe felt that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Earle_Buckle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">George Earle Buckle</a>, the editor of <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>, had not been vigorous enough in the campaign against Germany and on 31st July, 1912, he forced his resignation. He was replaced by <a href="Geoffrey_Dawson.htm" class="ajax">Geoffrey Dawson</a>. Northcliffe told Dawson: &quot;Our task is great and worthy. If we get the barnacle-covered whale off the rocks &amp; safely into deep water while we are comparatively young we may be able to keep it there until we discover others who can carry on the work.&quot; (70) According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/27/obituaries/dr-stephen-koss-expert-on-history.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stephen E. Koss</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rise-Fall-Political-Press-Britain/dp/0006861903/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381760095&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+Political+Press+in+Britain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Rise and Fall of the Political Press in Britain</em></a> (1984) Dawson seems to have &quot;routinely acquiesced in Northcliffe's views and prejudices&quot;. (71) </p>
	<p>The layout of the newspaper paper was redesigned and to make it more competitive, &quot;the price was cut by half to one penny a copy&quot;. This was very successful and circulation rose dramatically from 47,000 in August 1912, when Dawson became editor. The first one-penny edition of the newspaper sold 281,000, but eventually settled down to an average 145,000 by the spring of 1914. (72) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe's newspapers continued to attack the Liberal government over its policies of progressive taxation, its apparently willingness to grant Irish Home Rule and the low-level of its defence spending. Northcliffe asked for a meeting with the prime minister. Asquith wrote to his confidante <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetia_Stanley_(1887%E2%80%931948)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Venetia Stanley</a> about the request: &quot;He (Northcliffe) is anxious that I should see him. I hate and distrust the fellow and all his works... so I merely said that if he chose to ask me directly to see him, and he had anything really new to communicate, I would not refuse. I know of few men in this world who are responsible for more mischief, and deserve a longer punishment in the next.&quot; (73) </p>
	<p>On 28th July, 1914, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> declared war on <a href="FWWinSerbia.htm" class="ajax">Serbia</a>. Northcliffe admitted that war seemed inevitable but blamed the Liberal government for not spending enough money on the armed forces. <a href="JscottCP.htm" class="ajax">C. P. Scott</a>, the editor of the <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><i>Manchester Guardian</i></a>, disagreed. &quot;Not only are we neutral now, but we could, and ought to remain neutral throughout the whole course of the war... We wish Serbia no ill; we are anxious for the peace of Europe. But Englishmen are not the guardians of Serbia well being, or even of the peace of Europe. Their first duty is to England and to the peace of England... We care as little for Belgrade as Belgrade does for Manchester.&quot; (74) </p>
	<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> disagreed and reported: &quot;The Austrian onslaught... will, it is to be feared, draw Russia into the field... in turn this will be followed by German action. Germany's entrance will compel France... When France is in peril, and fighting for her very existence, Great Britain cannot stand by and see her friend stricken down... We must stand by our friends, if for no other and heroic reason, because without their aid we cannot be safe. The failure to organise and arm the British nation so as to meet the new conditions of Europe has left us dependent on Foreign allies. We have forfeited our old independent position, and as the direct consequence we may be drawn into a quarrel with which we have no immediate concern. But at least we can be true to our duty today if we have neglected it in the past.&quot; (75) </p>
	<p>At a Cabinet meeting on Friday, 31st July, more than half the Cabinet, including <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a>, <a href="TUtrevelyan.htm" class="ajax">Charles Trevelyan</a>, <a href="REburns.htm" class="ajax">John Burns</a>, <a href="Jmorley.htm" class="ajax">John Morley</a>, <a href="PRsimonJ.htm" class="ajax">John Simon</a> and <a href="Charles_Hobhouse.htm" class="ajax">Charles Hobhouse</a>, were bitterly opposed to Britain entering the war. Only two ministers, Sir <a href="FWWgrey.htm" class="ajax">Edward Grey</a> and <a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a>, argued in favour and <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> appeared to support them. At this point, Churchill suggested that it might be possible to continue if some senior members of the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Party</a> could be persuaded to form a Coalition government. </p>
	<p>On 3rd August, 1914, Germany declared war on France. That evening an estimated 30,000 people took to the streets. They gathered around Buckingham Palace and eventually King <a href="MOgeorgeV.htm" class="ajax">George V</a> and the rest of the royal family appeared on the balcony. The crowd began singing &quot;God Save the King&quot; and then large numbers left to smash the windows of the German Embassy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Owen_(politician)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Frank Owen</a> points out that the previous day the crowds had been calling for a peaceful settlement of the crisis, now they were &quot;clamouring for war&quot;. (76) </p>
	<p>The following day the Germans marched into Belgium. According to the historian, <a href="Jtaylor.htm" class="ajax">A. J. P. Taylor</a>: &quot;At 10.30 p.m. on 4th August 1914 the king held a privy council at Buckingham Palace, which was attended only by one minister and two court officials. The council sanctioned the proclamation of a state of war with Germany from 11 p.m. That was all. The cabinet played no part once it had resolved to defend the neutrality of Belgium. It did not consider the ultimatum to Germany, which Sir Edward Grey, the foreign secretary, sent after consulting only the prime minister, Asquith, and perhaps not even him.&quot; (77) </p>
	<p><a href="TUtrevelyan.htm" class="ajax">Charles Trevelyan</a>, <a href="REburns.htm" class="ajax">John Burns</a>, and <a href="Jmorley.htm" class="ajax">John Morley</a>, all resigned from the government. However, David Lloyd George continued to serve in the cabinet. <a href="Frances_Stevenson.htm" class="ajax">Frances Stevenson</a>, Lloyd George's private secretary, later claimed: &quot;My own opinion is that Lloyd George's mind was really made up from the first, that he knew that we would have to go in and the invasion of Belgium was, to be cynical, a heaven-sent opportunity for supporting a declaration of war.&quot; (78) </p>
	<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> reported: &quot;Europe might have been spared all this turmoil and anguish if Great Britain had only been armed and organised for war as the needs of our age demand. The precaution has not been taken, but in this solemn hour we shall utter no reproaches on that account. Our duty is to go forward into the valley of the shadow of death with courage and faith - with courage to suffer, with faith in God and our country.&quot; (79) </p>
</section><section id="section7"><header><h5>The First World War </h5></header>
	<p>On the outbreak of the <a href="FWW.htm" class="ajax">First World War</a> the editor of <a href="Jstar.htm" class="ajax"><i>The Star</i></a> newspaper claimed that: &quot;Next to the Kaiser, Lord Northcliffe has done more than any living man to bring about the war.&quot; Once the war had started Northcliffe used his newspaper empire to promote anti-German hysteria. It was <em>The Daily Mail</em> that first used the term &quot;Huns&quot; to describe the Germans and &quot;thus at a stroke was created the image of a terrifying, ape-like savage that threatened to rape and plunder all of Europe, and beyond.&quot; (80) </p>
	<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/07/phillip-knightley-obituary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Philip Knightley</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=The+First+Casualty%3A+The+War+Correspondent+as+Hero%2C+Propagandist+and+Myth+Maker&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3AThe+First+Casualty%3A+The+War+Correspondent+as+Hero%5Cc+Propagandist+and+Myth+Maker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero, Propagandist and Myth Maker</em></a> (1982) has pointed out: &quot;The war was made to appear one of defence against a menacing aggressor. The Kaiser was painted as a beast in human form... The Germans were portrayed as only slightly better than the hordes of Genghis Khan, rapers of nuns, mutilators of children, and destroyers of civilisation.&quot; (81)  In one report the newspaper referred to Kaiser <a href="FWWkaiser.htm" class="ajax">Wilhelm II</a> as a &quot;lunatic,&quot; a &quot;barbarian,&quot; a &quot;madman,&quot; a &quot;monster,&quot; a &quot;modern judas,&quot; and a &quot;criminal monarch&quot;. (82) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe's main concern was a German invasion and was opposed to the <a href="FWWbef.htm" class="ajax">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF) being sent to France. On 5th August, 1914, he warned <a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a>, the First Lord of the Admiralty, against any plan to dispatch the BEF. He told the editor of <em>The Daily Mail</em>: &quot;I will not support the sending out of this country of a single British soldier. What about invasion? What about our own country? Put that in the leader... Say so in the paper tomorrow.&quot; (83) </p>
	<p>However, Churchill ignored Northcliffe and it was decided that the 120,000 soldiers in the BEF should be sent to Maubeuge in France. &quot;They (the Army Council) agreed that the fourteen Territorial divisions could protect the country from invasion. The BEF was free to go abroad. Where to? There could be no question of helping the Belgians, through this was why Great Britain had gone to war. The BEF had no choice: it must go to Maubeuge on the French left.&quot; (84) </p>
	<p>Over the last few months Lord Northcliffe's newspapers campaigned for <a href="FWWkitchener.htm" class="ajax">Lord Kitchener</a> to become Secretary of State for War. It claimed that this post might go to <a href="TUhaldane.htm" class="ajax">Richard Haldane</a>, a man who Northcliffe believed was pro-German, who had been responsible for delaying war preparations. (85) However, Asquith eventually took Northcliffe's advice and gave Kitchener the post. According to <a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C3303082" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">George Arthur</a>, Kitchener's biographer, became Secretary of War because of &quot;the persistence of Lord Northcliffe&quot;. (86) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe believed that the intertwined national economies of 1914 could not stand more than a few months of conflict. Military experts agreed and predicted that the war would involve battles of movement, fought by professional armies which would be home by Christmas. Northcliffe expected the &quot;British Navy would win the war for Britain by defeating the enemy fleet and blockading Germany&quot;. (87) </p>
	<p>Kitchener disagreed with Northcliffe on this issue: <a href="Jtaylor.htm" class="ajax">A.J.P. Taylor</a> has pointed out: &quot;He (Lord Kitchener) startled his colleagues at the first cabinet meeting which he attended by announcing that the war would last three years, not three months, and that Great Britain would have to put an army of millions into the field. Regarding the Territorial Army with undeserved contempt, he proposed to raise a New Army of seventy divisions and, when Asquith ruled out compulsion as politically impossible, agreed to do so by voluntary recruiting.&quot; (88) </p>
	<p>On 7th August, 1914, the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a> was told that Britain needed an army of 500,000 men. The same day Lord Kitchener issued his first appeal for 100,000 volunteers. He got an immediate response with 175,000 men volunteering in a single week. With the help of a war poster that featured Kitchener and the words: &quot;Join Your Country's Army&quot;, 750,000 had enlisted by the end of September. </p>
<figure>                      <p><img src="FWWhaigposter.JPG" width="236" height="327" alt="" /></p>                      </figure>
	<p>According to his biographer, <a href="http://www.rmc.ca/aca/his/per/neilson-k-eng.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Keith Neilson</a>: &quot;Kitchener brought to his new office both strengths and weaknesses. He had waged two wars in which he had dealt with all aspects of warfare, including both command and logistics. He was used to being in charge of large enterprises, he was not afraid to take responsibility and make decisions, and he enjoyed public confidence. However, he had no experience of modern European war, almost no knowledge of the British army at home, and a limited understanding of the War Office. Perhaps most importantly, he had no experience of working in a cabinet. Nevertheless in the opening stage of the war he, Asquith, and Churchill formed a dominant triumvirate in the cabinet.&quot; (89) </p>
	<p>On 8th August 1914, the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a> passed the <a href="FWWdora.htm" class="ajax">Defence of the Realm Act</a> (DORA) without debate. The legislation gave the government executive powers to suppress published criticism, imprison without trial and to commandeer economic resources for the war effort. During the war publishing information that was calculated to be indirectly or directly of use to the enemy became an offence and accordingly punishable in a court of law. This included any description of war and any news that was likely to cause any conflict between the public and military authorities.</p>
	<p>The British government established the <a href="FWWwarpress.htm" class="ajax">War Office Press Bureau</a> under <a href="PRbirkenhead.htm" class="ajax">F. E. Smith</a>. The idea was this organisation would censor news and telegraphic reports from the <a href="FWWbritain.htm" class="ajax">British Army</a> and then issue it to the press. Lord Northcliffe was furious when he heard the news and complained to Smith about the situation. He replied: &quot;We are bound to make mistakes at the start. Give me the advantage throughout of any advice which your experience suggests... Kitchener cannot understand that he is working in a democratic country. He rather thinks he is in Egypt where the press is represented by a dozen mangy newspaper correspondents whom he can throw in the Nile if they object to the way they are treated.&quot; (90) </p>
	<p> <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> complained bitterly about the DORA regulations: &quot;Public enthusiasm for our army is not being chilled by the insufficiency of news concerning the British troops at the front. The newspapers do not wish to publish... anything that might be injurious to the military interests of the nation... while we will agree that a careful censorship is necessary for success, it might seem that the reticence in Great Britain has been carried to an unnecessary extreme.&quot; (91) </p>
	<p><a href="FWWkitchener.htm" class="ajax">Lord Kitchener</a>, the War Minister, was determined not to have any journalists reporting the war from the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>. He instead appointed Colonel <a href="FWWswinton.htm" class="ajax">Ernest Swinton</a>, to write reports on the war. These were then vetted by Kitchener before being sent to the newspapers. Lord Northcliffe ignored this attempt at press censorship and sent two of his journalists, <a href="Jfyfe.htm" class="ajax">Hamilton Fyfe</a> and <a href="http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1197" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arthur Moore</a> to France. </p>
	<p>On 30th August, 1914, <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> published a report on the problems faced by the <a href="FWWbef.htm" class="ajax">British Expeditionary Force</a> on the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>. &quot;The German advance has been one of almost incredible rapidity... The Germans, fulfilling one of the best of all precepts in war, never gave the retreating army one single moment's rest. The pursuit was immediate, relentless, unresting. Aeroplanes, Zeppelins, armoured motors, were loosed like an arrow from the bow... Regiments were grievously injured, and the broken army fought its way desperately with many stands, forced backwards and ever backwards by the sheer unconquerable mass of numbers... Our losses are very great. I have seen the broken bits of mass regiments... The German commanders in the north advance their men as if they had an inexhaustible supply.&quot; (92) </p>
	<p>In the House of Commons, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Llewelyn_Williams" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">William Llewelyn Williams</a> asked <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> was aware of the report that British forces had suffered a major defeat in France. The prime minister replied: &quot;It is impossible too highly to commend the patriotic reticence of the Press as a whole from the beginning of the war up to the present moment. The publication to which my honourable friend refers appears to be a very regrettable exception - and I hope it will not recur... The Government feel after the experience of the last two weeks that the public is entitled to information - prompt and authentic information - of what is happening at the front, and which they hope will be more adequate.&quot; (93) </p>
	<p><a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a> wrote to Lord Northcliffe and complained about the article: &quot;I think you ought to realize the damage that has been done by Sunday's publication in the Times. I do not think you can possibly shelter yourself behind the Press Bureau, although their mistake was obvious. I never saw such panic-stricken stuff written by any war correspondent before; and this served up on the authority of the Times can be made, and has been made, a weapon against us in every doubtful state.&quot; (94)</p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe replied: &quot;This is not a time for Englishmen to quarrel... Nor will I discuss the facts and tone of the message, beyond saying that it came from one of the most experienced correspondents in the service of the paper. I understand that not a single member of the staff on duty last Saturday night expected to see it passed by the Press Bureau.&quot; He then pointed out that it was not only passed but carefully edited and it seemed that the government actually wanted it to published. (95) </p>
	<p>To circumvent the Press Bureau, the Northcliffe newspapers often quoted American journals. For example, on 4th December, 1914, the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Mail</em></a> carried excerpts from the <a href="USAsaturday.htm" class="ajax"><em>Saturday Evening Post</em></a> that quoted Lord Kitchener as saying that Britain would need at least three more years to defeat Germany. (96) Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Buckmaster,_1st_Viscount_Buckmaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stanley Buckmaster</a> at the Press Bureau, asked the government to use DORA to court-martial Lord Northcliffe. This idea was rejected by the government. It was claimed that David Lloyd George was Northcliffe's greatest defender and GR argued that there was &quot;no doubt some sort of understanding between him and Northcliffe.&quot; (97) </p>
	<p>Some journalists were already in France when war was declared in August 1914. <a href="Jgibbs.htm" class="ajax">Philip Gibbs</a>, a journalist working for <a href="Jchronicle.htm" class="ajax"><i>The Daily Chronicle</i></a>, quickly attached himself to the <a href="FWWbef.htm" class="ajax">British Expeditionary Force</a> and began sending in reports from the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>. When <a href="FWWkitchener.htm" class="ajax">Lord Kitchener</a> discovered what was happening he ordered the arrest of Gibbs. After being warned that if he was caught again he &quot;would be put up against a wall and shot&quot;, Gibbs was sent back to England. (98) </p>
	<p>The result of Lord Kitchener's policy was that during the early stages of the war British journalists in France were treated as outlaws. They could be arrested at any time and by any officer, either French or British who discovered them. Kitchener gave orders that any correspondent found would be immediately arrested, expelled and have his passport cancelled. &quot;under these conditions it was difficult for the war correspondents to get reports and messages to their newspapers.&quot; (99) </p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Clarke" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Basil Clarke</a> of <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> later recalled: &quot;I count it among my achievements that I was never once arrested. The difficulties were numerous. Even to live in the war zone without papers and credentials was hard enough, but to move about and see things, and pick up news and then to get one's written dispatches conveyed home - against all regulations - was a labour greater and more complex than anything I have ever undertaken in journalistic work. I longed sometimes to be arrested and sent home and done with it all.&quot; (100) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe was determined to make <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> the official newspaper of the <a href="FWWbritain.htm" class="ajax">British Army</a>. Every day 10,000 copies of the paper were delivered to the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a> by military motor cars. He also had the revolutionary idea of using front-line soldiers as news sources. Soon after the outbreak of war he announced a scheme where he would pay for letters sent to their families by serving soldiers. (101) </p>
	<p>Northcliffe's newspapers were willing to publish stories about German &quot;atrocities&quot; in Belgium and France. On 17th August 1914 the Daily Mail carried accounts of how German soldiers had murdered five civilians. (102) A few days later <a href="Jfyfe.htm" class="ajax">Hamilton Fyfe</a> chronicled the &quot;sins against civilization&quot; and the &quot;barbarity&quot; of the Germans. He also wrote a story about how Germans had cut off the hands of Red Cross workers and had used women and children as shields in battle&quot;. (103)</p>
	<p>This was followed by a fuller account of the atrocities: &quot;The measured, detailed, and we fear unanswerable indictment of Germany's conduct of the war issued yesterday by the Belgian minister is a catalogue of horrors that will indelibly brand the German name in the eyes of all mankind.. This is no ordinary arraignment... concerned not with hearsay evidence, but with incidents that in each case have been carefully investigated... After making every deduction for national bias and the possibility of error, there remains a record of sheer brutality that will neither be forgiven or forgotten.&quot; (104) </p>
	<p><a href="Jgraves.htm" class="ajax">Robert Graves</a>, who served on the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>, raised doubts about the truth of these stories, in his book on the war, <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goodbye-That-Essential-penguin-Robert-Graves/dp/0140274200/ref=sr_1_1/026-8815493-9662854?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1194619576&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Goodbye to All That</a></i>: &quot;French and Belgian civilians had often tried to win our sympathy by exhibiting mutilations of children - stumps of hands and feet, for instance - representing them as deliberate, fiendish atrocities when, as likely as not, they were merely the result of shell-fire. We did not believe rape to be any more common on the German side of the line than on the Allied side. And since a bully-beef diet, fear of death, and absence of wives made ample provision of women necessary in the occupied areas, no doubt the German army authorities provided brothels in the principal French towns behind the line, as the French did on the Allied side. We did not believe stories of women's forcible enlistment in these establishments. <em>What's wrong with the voluntary system?</em> we asked cynically.&quot; (105)</p>
	<p>During the early stages of the conflict Northcliffe created a great deal of controversy by advocating <a href="FWWconscription.htm" class="ajax">conscription</a> and criticizing <a href="FWWkitchener.htm" class="ajax">Lord Kitchener</a>. In an article he wrote on 21st May, 1915, Northcliffe wrote a blistering attack on the Secretary of State for War: &quot;Lord Kitchener has starved the army in France of high-explosive shells. The admitted fact is that Lord Kitchener ordered the wrong kind of shell - the same kind of shell which he used largely against the Boers in 1900. He persisted in sending shrapnel - a useless weapon in trench warfare. He was warned repeatedly that the kind of shell required was a violently explosive bomb which would dynamite its way through the German trenches and entanglements and enable our brave men to advance in safety. This kind of shell our poor soldiers have had has caused the death of thousands of them.&quot; (106) </p>

	<p>Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="FWWrepington.htm" class="ajax">Charles Repington</a>, the chief war correspondent of <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>, was a close friend of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, <a href="FWWfrench.htm" class="ajax">Sir John French</a>, and was invited to visit the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>. Repington now had growing influence over military policy and one politician described him as &quot;the twenty-third member of the Cabinet&quot;. During the offensive at <a href="FWWartois.htm" class="ajax">Artois</a>, Repington was shown confidential information about the <a href="FWWbritain.htm" class="ajax">British Army</a> being short of artillery shells. (107) </p>
	<p>On 14th May, 1915, the newspaper published the contents of a telegram sent by Repington: &quot;The attacks (on Sunday last in the districts of Fromelles and Richebourg) were well planned and valiantly conducted. The infantry did splendidly, but the conditions were too hard. The want of an unlimited supply of high explosives was a fatal bar to our success at Festubert.&quot; (108) </p>
	<p><em>The Daily Mail</em> now launched an attack on Lord Kitchener and under the heading &quot;British Still Struggling: Send More Shells&quot; it argued that the newspaper was in a very difficult position for if it published &quot;the truth about the defects of our military preparations&quot;. It claimed that under the <a href="FWWdora.htm" class="ajax">Defence of the Realm Act</a> (DORA) the newspaper could be accused of aiding the enemy; and if it didn't, it was not fulfilling its responsibility to keep the public informed of the situation. (109) </p>
	<p> Lord Northcliffe decided to make a direct on <a href="FWWkitchener.htm" class="ajax">Lord Kitchener</a> for not supplying enough high-explosive shells. In an article he published on 21st May, 1915, Northcliffe wrote a blistering attack on the Secretary of State for War: &quot;Lord Kitchener has starved the army in France of high-explosive shells. The admitted fact is that Lord Kitchener ordered the wrong kind of shell - the same kind of shell which he used largely against the Boers in 1900. He persisted in sending shrapnel - a useless weapon in trench warfare. He was warned repeatedly that the kind of shell required was a violently explosive bomb which would dynamite its way through the German trenches and entanglements and enable our brave men to advance in safety. This kind of shell our poor soldiers have had has caused the death of thousands of them.&quot; (110) </p>
	<p>The following day <em>The Daily Mail</em><em> </em>continued the attack. The paper stated that &quot;our men at the Front have been supplied with the wrong kind of shell and the result has been a heavy and avoidable loss of life&quot;. A shortage of shells at the beginning of the conflict was understandable and excusable, but the inability of officials to supply adequate munitions after ten months for Britain's fighting men was &quot;proof of grave negligence&quot;. (111) </p>
	<p>Lord Kitchener was a national hero and Northcliffe's attack on him upset a great number of readers. Overnight, the circulation of <em>The Daily Mail</em> dropped from 1,386,000 to 238,000. A placard was hung across <em>The Daily Mail</em> nameplate with the words &quot;The Allies of the Huns&quot;. Over 1,500 members of the Stock Exchange had a meeting where they passed a motion against the &quot;venomous attacks of the Harmsworth Press&quot; and afterwards ceremoniously burnt copies of the offending newspaper. (112) </p>
	<p>The editor of the newspaper, <a href="Thomas_Marlowe.htm" class="ajax">Thomas Marlowe</a>, informed Lord Northcliffe of the more than one million drop in circulation. He was also given a copy of <a href="Jstar.htm" class="ajax"><i>The Star</i></a> that defended Kitchener from Northcliffe's attacks. Northcliffe responded by arguing: &quot;I don't know what you men think and I don't care. The Star is wrong, and I am right. And the day will come when you will all know that I am right.&quot; (113) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe wrote to <a href="Geoffrey_Dawson.htm" class="ajax">Geoffrey Dawson</a>, the editor of the <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>: &quot;Nearly every day in some part or other of The Times appears a puff of Kitchener... Lloyd George assures me that this man is the curse of the country. He gave me example after example on Sunday night of the loss of life due to this man's ineptitude. Is it not possible to keep his name out of the paper.&quot; (114) </p>
	<p>Although the leader of the government, <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H.H Asquith</a>, accused Northcliffe and his newspapers of disloyalty, he privately accepted that shell production was a real problem and he appointed <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> as the new Munitions Minister. &quot;He (Lloyd George) believed he was the man - perhaps the only man - who could win the war.&quot; (115) <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/479638.S_J_Taylor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">S. J. Taylor</a> has argued: &quot;David Lloyd George was installed as Minister of Munitions, and it was generally believed his appointment was what Northcliffe had intended all along. Certainly, Lloyd George brought to the newly created position the energy, competence and cynicism it required.&quot; (116) </p>
	<p>In the spring of 1916 <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="brokenlink" class="ajax">Herbert Asquith</a> decided to send Lord Kitchener to Russia in an attempt to rally the country in its fight against Germany. On 5th June 1916, Kitchener was drowned when the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hampshire_%281903%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HMS Hampshire</a></i> on which he was traveling to Russia, was struck a mine off the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney_Islands" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Orkneys</a>. <a href="JscottCP.htm" class="ajax"></a>When he heard the news Lord Northcliffe remarked: &quot;The British Empire has just had the greatest stroke of luck in its history.... Providence is on the side of the British Empire after all.&quot; (117) Lloyd George also believed that the death of Kitchener was &quot;at the best possible moment for the country&quot;. (118) </p>
</section><section id="section8"><header><h5>Military Conscription</h5></header>
	<p>Over 3,000,000 men volunteered to serve in the British Armed Forces during the first two years of the war. Over 750,000 had enlisted by the end of September, 1914. Thereafter the average ran at 125,000 men a month until the summer of 1915 when numbers joining up began to slow down. <a href="2WWamery.htm" class="ajax">Leo Amery</a>, the MP for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Sparkbrook_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Birmingham Sparkbrook</a> pointed out: &quot;Every effort was made to whip up the flagging recruiting campaign. Immense sums were spent on covering all the walls and hoardings of the United Kingdom with posters, melodramatic, jocose or frankly commercial... The continuous urgency from above for better recruiting returns... led to an ever-increasing acceptance of men unfit for military work... Throughout 1915 the nominal totals of the Army were swelled by the maintenance of some 200,000 men absolutely useless for any conceivable military purpose.&quot; (119) </p>
	<p>The British had suffered high casualties at the <a href="FWWmarne.htm" class="ajax">Marne</a> (12,733), <a href="FWWypres.htm" class="ajax">Ypres</a> (75,000), <a href="FWWgallipoli.htm" class="ajax">Gallipoli</a> (205,000), <a href="FWWartois.htm" class="ajax">Artois</a> (50,000) and <a href="FWWloos.htm" class="ajax">Loos</a> (50,000). The British Army found it difficult to replace these men. In May 1915 135,000 men volunteered, but for August the figure was 95,000, and for September 71,000. Asquith appointed a Cabinet Committee to consider the recruitment problem. Testifying before the Committee, Lloyd George commented: &quot;I would say that every man and woman was bound to render the services that the State they could best render. I do not believe you will go through this war without doing it in the end; in fact, I am perfectly certain that you will have to come to it.&quot; (120) </p>
	<p>The shortage of recruits became so bad that <a href="MOgeorgeV.htm" class="ajax">George V</a> was asked to make an appeal: &quot;At this grave moment in the struggle between my people and a highly-organized enemy, who has transgressed the laws of nations and changed the ordinance that binds civilized Europe together, I appeal to you. I rejoice in my Empire's effort, and I feel pride in the voluntary response from my subjects all over the world who have sacrificed home, fortune, and life itself, in order that another may not inherit the free Empire which their ancestors and mine have built. I ask you to make good these sacrifices. The end is not in sight. More men and yet more are wanted to keep my armies in the field, and through them to secure victory and enduring peace.... I ask you, men of all classes, to come forward voluntarily, and take your share in the fight&quot;. (121) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe now began to advocate conscription (compulsory enrollment). On 16th August, 1915, the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><i>Daily Mail</i></a> published a &quot;Manifesto&quot; in support of national service. (122) The <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Party</a> agreed with Lord Northcliffe about conscription but most members of the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a> and the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> were opposed to the idea on moral grounds. Some military leaders objected because they had a &quot;low opinion of reluctant warriors&quot;. (123) </p>
	<p>Asquith &quot;did not oppose it on principle, though he was certainly not drawn to it temperamentally and had intellectual doubts about its necessity.&quot; Lloyd George had originally had doubts about the measure but by 1915 &quot;he was convinced that the voluntary system of recruitment had served its turn and must give way to compulsion&quot;. (124) Asquith told <a href="FWWhankey.htm" class="ajax">Maurice Hankey</a> that he believed that &quot;Lloyd George is out to break the government on conscription if he can.&quot; (125) </p>
	<p>Lloyd George threatened to resign if Asquith did not introduce conscription. Eventually he gave in and the Military Service Bill was introduced by Asquith on 21st January 1916. <a href="PRsimonJ.htm" class="ajax">John Simon</a>, the Home Secretary, resigned and so did <a href="TUhenderson.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Henderson</a>, who had represented the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> in the coalition government. <a href="Alfred_Gardiner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred George Gardiner</a>, the editor of the <a href="Jnews.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily News</em></a> argued that Lloyd George was engineering the conscription crisis in order to substitute himself for Asquith as leader of the country.&quot; (126) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe received a large number of threatening letters because of his compulsion campaign. <a href="Tom_Clarke.htm" class="ajax">Tom Clarke</a>, who worked for Northcliffe, saw the contents of these letters, commented that one said: &quot;Warning to Lord Northcliffe... If the compulsion Bill is passed you are a dead man. I and another half-dozen young men have made a pledge - that is, to shoot you like a dog. We know where to find you.&quot; (127) </p>
	<p>In a speech he made in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conwy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Conwy</a> Lloyd George denied that he was involved in any plot against Asquith: &quot;I have worked with him for ten years. I have served under him for eight years. If we had not worked harmoniously - and we have - let me tell you here at once that it would have been my fault and not his. I have never worked with anyone who could be more considerate... But we have had our differences. Good heavens, of what use would I have been if I had not differed from him? Freedom of speech is essential everywhere, but there is one place where it is vital, and that is in the Council Chamber of the nation. The councillor who professes to agree with everything that falls from the leader betrays him.&quot;</p>
	<p>Lloyd George then went on to suggest that Asquith had reluctantly supported conscription, whereas to him, it was vitally important if Britain was going to win the war. &quot;You must organise effort when a nation is in peril. You cannot run a war as you would run a Sunday school treat, where one man voluntarily brings the buns, another supplies the tea, one brings the kettle, one looks after the boiling, another takes round the tea-cups, some contribute in cash, and a good many lounge about and just make the best of what is going on. You cannot run a war like that.&quot; He said he was in favour of compulsory enlistment, in the same way as he was &quot;for compulsory taxes or for compulsory education.&quot; (128)</p>
	<p><a href="Jgraves.htm" class="ajax">Robert Graves</a>, who was home on leave from the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a> at the time, was in the audience. &quot;The power of his rhetoric amazed me. The substance of the speech might be commonplace, idle, and false, but I had to fight hard against abandoning myself with the rest of his audience. He sucked power from his listeners and spurted it back at them. Afterwards, my father introduced me to Lloyd George, and when I looked closely at his eyes they seemed like those of a sleep walker.&quot; (129)</p>
	<p><a href="Jtaylor.htm" class="ajax">A. J. P. Taylor</a> has argued that Lord Northcliffe and Lloyd George reflected the mood of the British people in 1916: &quot;Popular feeling wanted some dramatic action. The agitation crystallized around the demand for compulsory military service. This was a political gesture, not a response to practical need. The army had more men than it could equip, and voluntary recruitment would more than fill the gap, at any rate until the end of 1916... Instead of unearthing 650,000 slackers, compulsion produced 748,587 new claims to exemption, most of them valid... In the first six months of conscription the average monthly enlistment was not much above 40,000 - less than half the rate under the voluntary system.&quot; (130) </p>
	<p>According to the editor of the News Desk at <em>The Daily Mail</em>: &quot;It seemed to us at this time that Northcliffe had attained a position of extraordinary power in the land. Although one never heard him boasting, his bearing suggested that he believed he had saved England from the follies of incompetent government... His campaigns up to date had certainly met with remarkable success. He had scored his first hit by getting Kitchener at the War Office. He had said racing must be stopped, and it was. He had said the shell scandal must be put right by the formation of a Ministry, and the Munitions Ministry was formed under Lloyd George... He had said single men must go first, and it was so. He had demanded a smaller Cabinet to get on with the war, and a special War Council of the Cabinet had been set up... And now he had got compulsion.&quot; (131) </p>
	<p>In December 1915, General <a href="FWWhaig.htm" class="ajax">Douglas Haig</a> was appointed commander in chief of the <a href="FWWbef.htm" class="ajax">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF) and General <a href="FWWrobertson.htm" class="ajax">William Robertson</a>, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. The two men became convinced that the war would be won on the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>. Robertson wrote: &quot;If the Germans are to be defeated they must be beaten by a process of slow attrition, by a slow and gradual advance on our part, each step being prepared by a predominant artillery fire and great expenditure of ammunition&quot;. (132) </p>
	<p><a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a>, the Minister of Munitions, visited Haig's Headquarters at Montreuil on 30th January 1916. The personalities of these two men were different and they failed to form a good relationship. Brigadier-General <a href="FWWcharterisJ.htm" class="ajax">John Charteris</a>, recalled their first meeting: &quot;Although Haig appreciated Mr Lloyd George's vitality, there was nothing in common between the outlook of the two men, and the seeds of a deep and mutual distrust were already sown.&quot; (133) </p>
	<p>Haig was intitially very hostile to Lord Northcliffe, and described the way General <a href="FWWfrench.htm" class="ajax">John French</a> had attempted to gain the support of the newspaper baron as &quot;carrying on with a whore&quot;. (134) However, Robertson advised Haig to develop a good relationship with the newspaper barons: &quot;I am sure things would be much better if we got the press on our side... My idea is that we ought to send out, on your invitation, 4 or 5 of the big newspaper Proprietors e.g. Northcliffe, Burnham etc for a few days to some part of our front.&quot; (135) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe developed a close relationship with General Haig and became convinced that he was the man to win the war. The message in his newspapers was that &quot;the inept politicians were letting down the clever generals&quot;. Robertson complained to Northcliffe that Lloyd George was trying to get involved in military strategy. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Davies_(politician)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Joesph Davies</a>, Lloyd George's personal secretary, Northcliffe said &quot;you can tell him (Lloyd George) from me I hear that he has been interfering with strategy, and that if it goes on I will break him... if further interference took place with Sir William Robertson&quot; he would go the <a href="Plords.htm" class="ajax">House of Lords</a> &quot;to lay matters before the world, and hammer them daily in my newspapers.&quot; As one of Northcliffe's biographers pointed out, by the end of 1915 he was &quot;more of a bully than a critic&quot;. (136) </p>
	<p>By the spring of 1916, morale in Britain was at an all-time low. &quot;Haig needed a breakthrough to boost the flagging spirits of a country still in principle fully behind the war, patriotic and pressing for military victory.&quot; After a meeting with the French Commander-in-Chief, <a href="FWWjoffre.htm" class="ajax">Joseph Joffre</a>, it was decided to mount a joint offensive where the British and French lines joined on the <a href="FWWwestern.htm" class="ajax">Western Front</a>. (137) According to <a href="2WWliddel.htm" class="ajax">Basil Liddell Hart</a>, the decision by Joffre to make this sector, considered to be the German's strongest, &quot;seems to have been arrived at solely because the British would be bound tp take part in it.&quot; (138) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe was told about the plan when he visited General Haig in May 1916. He agreed to give his full support in his newspapers to the offensive. One of his biographers, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/479638.S_J_Taylor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">S. J. Taylor</a>, points out: &quot;Northcliffe... at last capitulated, the <em>Daily Mail</em> descending into the propagandistic prose that came to characterize the reporting of the First World War. It was a style long since adopted by his competitors; stirring phrases, empty words, palpable lies.&quot; (139) </p>
	<p>General Haig wrote that he was convinced that the offensive would win the war: &quot;I feel that every step in my plan has been taken with the Divine help&quot;. (140) The <a href="FWWsomme.htm" class="ajax">Battle of the Somme</a> began in early hours of the 1st July 1916, when nearly a quarter of a million shells were fired at the German positions in just over an hour, an average of 3,500 a minute. So intense was the barrage that it was heard in London. At 7.28 a.m. ten mines were exploded under the German trenches. Two minutes later, British and French troops attacked along a 25-mile front. The main objective was &quot;to break through the German lines by means of a massive infantry assault, to try to create the conditions in which cavalry could then move forward rapidly to exploit the breakthrough.&quot; (141)</p>
	<p>On the first day of the battle thirteen British divisions went &quot;over the top&quot; in regular waves. &quot;The attack was a total failure. The barrage did not obliterate the Germans. Their machine guns knocked the British over in rows: 19,000 killed, 57,000 casualties sustained - the greatest loss in a single day ever suffered by a British army and the greatest suffered by any army in the First World War. Haig had talked beforehand of breaking off the offensive if it were not at once successful. Now he set his teeth and kept doggedly on - or rather, the men kept on for him.&quot; (142) </p>
	<p>Haig was helped in this by newspapers reporting that the offensive was a success. <a href="Jbeach.htm" class="ajax">William Beach Thomas</a>, in <em>The Daily Mail</em><em>, </em> under the headline, &quot;Enemy Outgunned&quot;, wrote: &quot;We are laying siege not to a place but to the German Army - that great engine which had at last mounted to its final perfection and utter lust of dominion. In the first battle, we have beaten the Germans by greater dash in the infantry and vastly superior weight in munitions.&quot; (143) In a later report he claimed: The very attitudes of the dead, fallen eagerly forwards, have the look of expectant hope. You would say they died with the light of victory in their eyes.&quot; (144) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe visited Haig again on 9th September, 1916. Haig arranged for General <a href="FWWbyng.htm" class="ajax">Julian Byng</a> to show him the new armed vehicle, codenamed <a href="FWWtankdevelop.htm" class="ajax">tank</a>. &quot;Northcliffe tried to enter one of them by the manhole on the top; but as his girth was some inches larger than the hole, he stuck midway and had to be hauled down to the inside by the feet while I sat on his shoulders above. Getting him out again was an even harder matter, though presently he emerged minus some buttons.&quot; (145) </p>
	<p>Of the 59 tanks in France, only 49 were considered to be in good working order. Of these, 17 broke down on the way to their starting point at <a href="FWWflers.htm" class="ajax">Flers</a>. The <a href="FWWmother.htm" class="ajax">Mark I (Mother)</a> tank failed to break through German lines at the Somme on 15th September, 1916. However, <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> reported that this &quot;new type of heavy armoured car&quot; was a great success. (146) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe developed a close friendship with <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a>. Both men were concerned that the stalemate on the Western Front would encourage <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> to seek a negotiated peace with Germany. Northcliffe arranged for Lloyd George to be interviewed by <a href="Jroy_howard.htm" class="ajax">Roy Howard</a> of the American United Press. Published on 29th September, 1916, the War Secretary declared that the Allies intended to fight to the finish and would not agree to a compromise peace.&quot; (147) </p>
	<p>General <a href="FWWhaig.htm" class="ajax">Douglas Haig</a> continued to order further attacks on German positions at the Somme and on the 13th November the British Army captured the fortress at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont-Hamel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beaumont Hamel</a>. However, heavy snow forced Haig to abandon his gains. With the winter weather deteriorating Haig now brought an end to the Somme offensive. Since the 1st July, the British has suffered 420,000 casualties. The French lost nearly 200,000 and it is estimated that German casualties were in the region of 500,000. Allied forces gained some land but it reached only 12km at its deepest points. Despite mounting criticism over his seeming disregard of British lives, Haig survived as Commander-in-Chief. One of the main reasons for this was the support he received from Northcliffe's newspapers. (148) </p>
</section><section id="section9"><header><h5>Removal of H. H. Asquith </h5></header>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe joined with Lloyd George in attempting to persuade Asquith and several of his cabinet, including Sir <a href="FWWgrey.htm" class="ajax">Edward Grey</a>, <a href="PRbalfour.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Balfour</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Crewe-Milnes,_1st_Marquess_of_Crewe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Robert Crewe-Milnes</a>, 1st Marquess of Crewe and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Petty-Fitzmaurice,_5th_Marquess_of_Lansdowne" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice</a>, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, to resign. It was reported that Lloyd George was trying to encourage Asquith to establish a small War Council to run the war and if he did not agree he would resign. (149) </p>
	<p><a href="Tom_Clarke.htm" class="ajax">Tom Clarke</a>, the news editor of <em>The Daily Mail</em>, claims that Lord Northcliffe told him to take a message to the editor, <a href="Thomas_Marlowe.htm" class="ajax">Thomas Marlowe</a>, that he was to run an article on the political crisis with the headline, &quot;Asquith a National Danger&quot;. According to Clarke, Marlowe &quot;put the brake on the Chief's impetuosity&quot; and instead used the headline &quot;The Limpets: A National Danger&quot;. He also told Clarke to print pictures of Lloyd George and Asquith side by side: &quot;Get a smiling picture of Lloyd George and get the worst possible picture of Asquith.&quot; Clarke told Northcliffe that this was &quot;rather unkind, to say the least&quot;. Northcliffe replied: &quot;Rough methods are needed if we are not to lose the war... it's the only way.&quot; (150)</p>
	<p>Those newspapers that supported the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a>, became concerned that a leading supporter of the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Party</a> should be urging Asquith to resign. <a href="Alfred_Gardiner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred George Gardiner</a>, the editor of <a href="Jnews.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily News</em></a>, objected to Lord Northcliffe's campaign against Asquith: &quot;If the present Government falls, it will fall because Lord Northcliffe decreed that it should fall, and the Government that takes its place, no matter who compose it, will enter on its task as the tributary of Lord Northcliffe.&quot; (151) </p>
	<p>Asquith was in great difficulty but he did have Cabinet ministers who did not want Lloyd George as prime minister. <a href="PRjenkinsR.htm" class="ajax">Roy Jenkins</a> has argued that he should have had a meeting with &quot;Cecil, Chamberlain, Curzon and Long might have had considerable effect. To begin with, he would no doubt have found them wavering. But he was not without influence over them. In the course of the discussion their doubts about Lloyd George would have come to the surface, and the conclusion might have been that they would have stiffened Asquith, and he would have stiffened them.&quot; (152) Lloyd George's biographer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Grigg,_2nd_Baron_Altrincham" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">John Grigg</a>, disagrees with Jenkins. His research suggests that Asquith had very little support from Conservative Party members of the coalition government and if he had tried to use them against Lloyd George it would end in failure. (153) </p>
	<p>On 4th December, 1916, <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> praised Lloyd George's stand against the present &quot;cumbrous methods of directing the war&quot; and urged Asquith to accept the &quot;alternative scheme&quot; of the small War Council, that he had proposed. Asquith should not be a member of the council and instead his qualities were &quot;fitted better... to preserve the unity of the Nation&quot;. (154) Even the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a> supporting <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><em>Manchester Guardian</em></a>, referred to the humiliation of Asquith, whose &quot;natural course would be either to resist the demand for a War Council, which would partly supersede him as Premier, or alternatively himself to resign.&quot; (155) </p>
	<p>Asquith came to the conclusion that Lloyd George had leaked embarrassing details of the conversation he had with Lloyd George, including the threat of resignation if he did not get what he wanted. That night he sent a note to Lloyd George: &quot;Such productions as the leading article in today's <em>Times</em>, showing the infinite possibilities for misunderstanding and misrepresentation of such an arrangement as we discussed yesterday, make me at least doubtful of its feasibility. Unless the impression is at once corrected that I am being relegated to the position of an irresponsible spectator of the War, I cannot go on.&quot; (156) </p>
	<p>Lloyd George denied the charge of leaking information but admitted that Lord Northcliffe wanted to &quot;smash&quot; his government. However, he went on to argue that Northcliffe also wanted to hurt him and had to put up with his newspaper's &quot;misrepresentations... for months&quot;. He added &quot;Northcliffe would like to make this (the formation of a small War Committee) and any other arrangement under your Premiership impossible... I cannot restrain nor I fear influence Northcliffe.&quot; (157) </p>
	<p>At a Cabinet meeting the following day, Asquith refused to form a new War Council that did not include him. Lloyd George immediately resigned: &quot;It is with great personal regret that I have come to this conclusion.... Nothing would have induced me to part now except an overwhelming sense that the course of action which has been pursued has put the country - and not merely the country, but throughout the world the principles for which you and I have always stood throughout our political lives - is the greatest peril that has ever overtaken them. As I am fully conscious of the importance of preserving national unity, I propose to give your Government complete support in the vigorous prosecution of the war; but unity without action is nothing but futile carnage, and I cannot be responsible for that.&quot; (158) </p>
	<p>Conservative members of the coalition made it clear that they would no longer be willing to serve under Asquith. At 7 p.m. he drove to Buckingham Palace and tendered his resignation to King <a href="MOgeorgeV.htm" class="ajax">George V</a>. Apparently, he told <a href="TUthomas.htm" class="ajax">J. H. Thomas</a>, that on &quot;the advice of close friends that it was impossible for Lloyd George to form a Cabinet&quot; and believed that &quot;the King would send for him before the day was out.&quot; Thomas replied &quot;I, wanting him to continue, pointed out that this advice was sheer madness.&quot; (159) </p>
	<p>Asquith, who had been prime minister for over eight years, was replaced by Lloyd George. He brought in a War Cabinet that included only four other members: <a href="PRcurzon.htm" class="ajax">George Curzon</a>, <a href="PRmilner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Milner</a>, <a href="PRbonar.htm" class="ajax">Andrew Bonar Law</a> and <a href="TUhenderson.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Henderson</a>. There was also the understanding that <a href="PRbalfour.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Balfour</a> attended when foreign affairs were on the agenda. Lloyd George was therefore the only <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a> member in the War Cabinet. Lloyd George wanted Northcliffe to become a member of the War Cabinet, however, Henderson told him that if this happened he would resign and take away the support of the Labour Party from the government. </p>
	<p><a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Chronicle</em></a> attacked the role that Lord Northcliffe and the other Conservative Party supporting newspaper barons had removed a democratically elected government. It argued that the new government &quot;will have to deal with the Press menace as well as the submarine menace; otherwise Ministries will be subject to tyranny and torture by daily attacks impugning their patriotism and earnestness to win the war.&quot; (160) </p>
	<p>On 9th December, 1916, <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> front page, under the headline, &quot;THE PASSING OF THE FAILURES&quot; had a series of photographs showing the outgoing ministers, <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a>, <a href="FWWgrey.htm" class="ajax">Edward Grey</a>, <a href="PRmckenna.htm" class="ajax">Reginald McKenna</a>, <a href="TUhaldane.htm" class="ajax">Richard Haldane</a>, <a href="PRsimonJ.htm" class="ajax">John Simon</a> and <a href="PRchurchill.htm" class="ajax">Winston Churchill</a>, with accompanying captions across their chests attacking their records in government. Northcliffe had ordered this feature, and congratulated the newspaper's picture department. </p>

	<p><a href="Alfred_Gardiner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred George Gardiner</a>, the editor of <a href="Jnews.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily News</em></a>, pointed out that David Lloyd George's new government's main advantage was that he had the support of Lord Northcliffe: &quot;It will be subject to a friendly organised and responsible criticism which will aim at sustaining it and not destroying it. The fall of the late Government and most of its failures were due to the absence of such a criticism. It became the target... of a ruthless and uncritical press campaign which appealed directly to the passions of the mob against the authority of Parliament.&quot; (161) </p>
	<p> Gardiner was right and the Lord Northcliffe press provided Lloyd George with a great deal of support. He was described as a &quot;human dynamo&quot; whose &quot;every erg of energy is focused on the immediate task at hand. He combines the persuasiveness of the Irishman with the concentration of the American and the thoroughness of the Englishman.&quot; In another article, written by Northcliffe stated: &quot;I believe that he will be the head of the Government that wins the war; that brings a settlement of the Irish question and maintains that essential factor goodwill between the people of the English speaking nations of the British Empire and the people of the United States&quot;. (162) </p>
	<p>In March 1917, Lord Northcliffe was appointed chairman of the new Civil Aerial Transport Committee. Two months later Northcliffe agreed to go to the United States of America as head of the British war mission. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(New_York)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>New York Sun</em></a> described &quot;Northcliffe as maker and unmaker of ministries; furious critic of slovenliness and incapacity and certainly regarded at home as the most powerful figure in British public life outside a responsible Ministry... he is a man of extraordinary energy and executive capacity, as well as tact and accurate understanding of the American people.&quot; (163) </p>
	<p><a href="USArepublic.htm" class="ajax"><em>The New Republic</em></a> appeared to be less impressed with Lord Northcliffe as he was seen as someone who had been responsible for bringing down the government of <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a>. It claimed that he had been sent to the United States because &quot;he exercised an enormous influence on British opinion&quot; and the British government &quot;rejoiced at the opportunity of installing him in a public office situated in a foreign country.&quot; (164) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe got on well with <a href="FWWwilsonW.htm" class="ajax">Woodrow Wilson</a> but believed that he had to appeal to his self-interest: &quot;The motive which brought the United States in was not sympathy for any other nation, was not desire for gain, was not an abstract fondness for democratic as opposed to autocratic government: it was self-interest, self-preservation, self-respect. The American People are not fighting to make the world safe for democracy, but to make the world safe for themselves.&quot; (165) </p>
	<p><a href="Rufus_Isaacs.htm" class="ajax">Rufus Isaacs</a>, replaced Lord Northcliffe in November, 1917. On his return Lloyd George offered him the Air Ministry. According to The Times he declared he &quot;could do better work&quot; if he maintained his &quot;independence&quot; and was not &quot;gagged by a loyalty that I do not feel towards the whole of your administration&quot;. (166) Lloyd George was furious as this upset <a href="FWWcowdray.htm" class="ajax">Lord Cowdray</a>, the current President of the Air Board, who resigned soon afterwards. Lloyd George told <a href="George_Riddell.htm" class="ajax">George Riddell</a>, that Northcliffe had &quot;no sense of loyalty&quot; and was probably &quot;angling for the Premiership&quot;. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Riddell%2C+More+Pages+from+My+Diary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em></em></a>(167)</p>
	<p>Northcliffe was &quot;too powerful a force for a politician in his precarious position to alienate&quot; and so he was elevated a step in the peerage from baron to viscount. <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/772886.J_Lee_Thompson" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">J. Lee Thompson</a>, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Northcliffe-Press-Baron-Politics-1865-1922/dp/0719557259/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1495626685&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=The+Great+Outsiders%3A+Northcliffe,+Rothermere+and+the+Daily+Mail" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Northcliffe: Press Baron in Politics 1865-1922</em></a> (2000), has pointed out, Lloyd George did not have &quot;the Liberal, the Labour nor the Conservative members behind him&quot; and so needed to retain the support of Northcliffe and the other press barons. (168) </p>
	<p>At the end of November, 1917, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Petty-Fitzmaurice,_5th_Marquess_of_Lansdowne" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice</a>, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, submitted a letter to <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> calling for a negotiated peace. Northcliffe refused to publish it and it appeared in the <a href="Jtelegraph.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Telegraph</em></a> instead: &quot;We are not going to lose this war, but its prolongation will spell ruin for the civilised world, and an infinite addition to the load of human suffering which already weighs upon it... We do not desire the annihilation of Germany as a great power... We do not seek to impose upon her people any form of government other than that of their own choice... We have no desire to deny Germany her place among the great commercial communities of the world.&quot; (169)</p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe was accused of trying to obstruct the peace process. <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> justified its decision by claiming &quot;the letter reflects no responsible phase of British opinion... in all the Allied countries it will be read with universal regret and reprobation.&quot; (170) <em>The Daily Mail</em> added that &quot;If Lord Lansdowne raises the white flag he is alone in his surrender&quot;. (171) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe was extremely hostile to the <a href="Russian-Revolution.htm" class="ajax">Russian Revolution</a>. As <a href="http://www.rolandchambers.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roland Chambers</a> pointed out: &quot;For the Allies, Soviet talks with Germany were not only a betrayal of the treaties signed at the beginning of the war, but a breach of faith with ordinary soldiers then fighting on the Western Front. Stretched to the limit of its own resources, the British government pictured the grain which would nourish German cities, the oil which would fuel German military vehicles and the German troops who, released from duty in the east, would transfer to France for a potentially decisive offensive. It was for these reasons that Lord Northcliffe's papers continued to beat the same old drums: a German-Jewish conspiracy that would plunge the world into darkness; priests crucified before their congregations; and particularly offensive to the Archbishop of Canterbury, a Soviet initiative to nationalize women.&quot; (172) </p>
</section><section id="section10"><header><h5>Director of Propaganda</h5></header>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe became very critical of General <a href="FWWrobertson.htm" class="ajax">William Robertson</a>, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who he blamed for the failures of <a href="FWWpasschendaele.htm" class="ajax">Passchendaele</a> and <a href="FWWcambrai.htm" class="ajax">Cambrai</a>. The attacks on Robertson became so bad that Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="FWWrepington.htm" class="ajax">Charles Repington</a>, the chief war correspondent of <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>, resigned over the issue. Repington told <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Strachey_(journalist)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">John St Loe Strachey</a>, the editor of <a href="Jspectator.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Spectator</em></a>, that &quot;I think they (Lloyd George and Northcliffe) are a curse to the country... I can't think why the Army Council does not take up Northcliffe, Marlow (editor of <em>The Daily Mail</em>) and Lovat Fraser (journalist employed by Northcliffe) and have them shot.&quot; (173) </p>
	<p>David Lloyd George had intended sacking both Robertson and General <a href="FWWhaig.htm" class="ajax">Douglas Haig</a>. However, he was incensed at Northcliffe's attack, because he feared it would only rally support for them. The prime minister urged Northcliffe to suspend his campaign and informed Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Bigge,_1st_Baron_Stamfordham" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Arthur Bigge</a>, the King's private secretary, that he felt like that he &quot;could have taken him out and shot him&quot; and told <a href="2WWamery.htm" class="ajax">Leo Amery</a> that it was now &quot;impossible to sack Robertson&quot;. However, after further pressure from Northcliffe he replaced Robertson with General <a href="FWWwilson.htm" class="ajax">Henry Wilson</a>. (174) </p>
	<p>In March, 1918, Northcliffe was approached by <a href="BUbeaverbrook.htm" class="ajax">Lord Beaverbrook</a>, the owner of the <a href="Jexpress.htm" class="ajax"><i>Daily Express</i></a> and the government's new <a href="FWWwpb.htm" class="ajax">Minister of Information</a>. Northcliffe now agreed to join the cabinet and take charge of all propaganda directed at enemy countries. Over the next few months Northcliffe organised the dropping of four million leaflets behind enemy lines. Northcliffe insisted that his choice of the term director rather than minister reflected his freedom from David Lloyd George. (175) One of his main critics pointed out: &quot;The democracy, whose bulwark is Parliament, has been unseated, and mobocracy, whose dictator is Lord Northcliffe, is in power.&quot; (176) </p>
</section><section id="section11"><header><h5>Peace Settlement</h5></header>
	<p>On 17th October, 1918, <a href="Jstandard.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Evening Standard</em></a>, a member of the War Cabinet, <a href="PRmilner.htm" class="ajax">Alfred Milner</a>, the Secretary of State for War, gave his support for offering Germany surrender terms in an attempt to stop a communist revolution breaking out in Germany. (177) Five days later, Lord Northcliffe gave a speech when he denounced this proposal. He claimed that &quot;the way to create Bolshevism was to let the Hun off&quot;. Northcliffe was worried about the &quot;real danger of social upheaval... in this country and in other Allied countries, if an unsatisfactory peace is made&quot;. (178) </p>
	<p>On 28th October, his newspaper, <a href="Jevening.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Evening News</em></a>, continued the attack on Milner, commenting that &quot;his German origin is not forgotten and the man in the street declares that he is acting as a Prussian. Lord Milner should take care. If this impression were to spread the results might surprise him.&quot; (179) Milner wrote to <a href="PRcurzon.htm" class="ajax">George Curzon</a> complaining that &quot;most public men are in terror of him&quot;. (180)</p>
	<p>Northcliffe continued to use his newspaper empire to call for Germany's unconditional surrender. In one article he suggested that unless Germany was crushed the country would have to deal with them some time in the future. He even suggested that his newspapers might have to write about &quot;The Great War of 1938&quot;. He warned &quot;they will cheat you yet, those Junkers.&quot; (181) </p>
	<p>Lord Northcliffe wrote to <a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> demanding that he should be involved in the propaganda campaign that should take place before any peace agreement should be signed with Germany: &quot;In view of the urgency of the matter, I request that I be given, with the least possible delay, authority as Chairman of the British War Mission to undertake the Peace Terms propaganda in the closest collaboration with the various departments of state until the final peace settlement has been concluded.&quot; (182) </p>
	<p>In a debate in the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a>, a member of the War Cabinet, <a href="PRcurzon.htm" class="ajax">George Curzon</a>, decided to defend the government against the attacks of Lord Northcliffe: &quot;I am quite alive to the fact that it is almost high treason to say a word against Lord Northcliffe. I know his power and that he does not hesitate to exercise it to try to drive anybody out of any office or a public position if they incur his royal displeasure. But as at my time of life neither office nor its emoluments, nor anything connected with Governments, or indeed public life, makes the slightest difference... I venture to incur even the possibility of the odium of this great trust owner who monopolises in his own person so great a part of the Press of this country.&quot;</p>
	<p>Curzon then went on to deal with the treatment of Lord Milner: &quot;Within the last few days there has been an attack made by this noble Lord's, papers upon Lord Milner... who seems to have given an interview to a rival paper... Having read it and having read the criticism of some of Lord Northcliffe's papers upon it, I believed that it has been purposefully and intentionally misrepresented and misunderstood... It seems to me to be nothing but indecent that the gentleman engaged in foreign propaganda on behalf of His Majesty's Government should make part of his propaganda an attack on the Secretary of State for War in the Government under which he purports to serve.&quot;</p>
	<p>Curzon also dealt with Lord Northcliffe's motivation in attacking his colleagues in the government: &quot;I think it is really time to put an end to this kind of thing. The Government may imagine that they gain power and support, but I do not believe it for a moment. I believe that all the best elements in the country resent this kind of thing... At this present moment, when Lord Milner is in France... dealing, with matters of vital importance to this country... come these attacks, from an official of the Government... to drive him out of his office. For what? In order that Lord Northcliffe may get it or get into the War Cabinet, so that he may be present at the Peace Conference... The whole thing is a disgrace to public life in England and a disgrace to journalism.&quot; (183) </p>
	<p>The day after <a href="FWWarmistice.htm" class="ajax">Armistice Day</a> Northcliffe resigned from the government. Lloyd George's decision to join the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservatives</a> in removing <a href="PRasquith.htm" class="ajax">H. H. Asquith</a> in 1916 had split the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a>. In an effort to unite the party Lloyd George, offered Asquith the post of lord chancellor but he refused. Labour Party ministers in the coalition government, except for <a href="TUbarnes.htm" class="ajax">George Barnes</a>, also resigned, planning to put forward a clear socialist programme in the post-war government. (184) </p>
	<p><a href="PRgeorge.htm" class="ajax">David Lloyd George</a> and <a href="PRbonar.htm" class="ajax">Andrew Bonar Law</a> produced a joint coalition programme that stated its mission that would reconstruct Britain into a &quot;fit country for heroes&quot; <a href="Jfyfe.htm" class="ajax">Hamilton Fyfe</a> urged Lord Northcliffe, to support the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> in the election as it would help &quot;to restrain the forces which threaten to drive Labour into adopting revolutionary methods&quot;. After a meeting with <a href="TUhenderson.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Henderson</a>, Northcliffe decided to donate free space in the <em>Daily Mail</em> to the Labour Party. This was very helpful as it had no newspaper of its own. (185) </p>
	<p>In his early election speeches Lloyd George had pledged that Germany should be forced to pay &quot;up to the limit of her capacity&quot;. He also called for Kaiser <a href="FWWkaiser.htm" class="ajax">Wilhelm II</a> to go on trial (with the hope he should be found guilty and hanged) and for Germany to pay &quot;the whole cost of the war&quot;. This did not go far enough for Lord Northcliffe who the expulsion of enemy aliens and restrictions on German immigration and refused to advocate people to vote for the coalition government. (186) </p>
	<p>However, Lloyd George did not need the support of Northcliffe's newspapers and he won an overwhelming victory. In return for agreeing to support the future coalition government, 159 Liberals were allowed to stand for election without opposition from the Conservatives. In the <a href="GE1918.htm" class="ajax">1918 General Election</a>, Lloyd George's Coalition group won 459 seats and had a large majority over the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> (57) and members of the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a> (36) who had supported Asquith. </p>
	<p> <a href="Geoffrey_Dawson.htm" class="ajax">Geoffrey Dawson</a>, the editor of <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>, attended the <a href="FWWversailles.htm" class="ajax">Versailles Peace Conference</a>. He commented: &quot;All the world is here. It's like a gigantic cinema-show of eminent persons&quot;. However, on his return he was involved in a dispute with Northcliffe over the newspaper's coverage of the coalition government, which he considered &quot;too sympathetic&quot;. He wrote to Dawson: &quot;If you do not like my attitude, I beg you to do either one or two things - endeavour to see eye to eye with me, or relinquish your position. (187) Dawson resigned in February 1919, because he found Northcliffe's &quot;irresponsible Hun-baiting&quot; intolerable. (188) </p>

	<p>After the war Northcliffe retained his interest in new technology. He began a campaign to promote wireless communication by arranging for the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><i>Daily Mail</i></a> to sponsor the world's first wireless concert. In an editorial Northcliffe argued: &quot;Once before the <em>Daily Mail </em>stirred the national imagination to realise the vital importance of flying. It has now taken the lead in private wireless experiments with the object of cultivating national receptivity for the new science and of bringing minds in train for achievements to come.&quot; (189) </p>

	<p>In the <a href="GE1924.htm" class="ajax">1923 General Election</a>, the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> won 191 seats. Although the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservatives</a> had 258, <a href="PRmacdonald.htm" class="ajax">Ramsay MacDonald</a> agreed to head a minority government, and therefore became the first member of the party to become Prime Minister.

The only significant measure was the Wheatley Housing Act which began a building programme of 500,000 homes for rent to working-class families.</p>
	<p>Members of establishment were appalled by the idea of a Prime Minister who was a <a href="socialism.htm" class="ajax">socialist</a>. As <a href="http://www.rusi.org/about/staff/ref:B4721C7F7F315A/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gill Bennett</a> pointed out: &quot;It was not just the intelligence community, but more precisely the community of an elite - senior officials in government departments, men in &quot;the City&quot;, men in politics, men who controlled the Press - which was narrow, interconnected (sometimes intermarried) and mutually supportive. Many of these men... had been to the same schools and universities, and belonged to the same clubs. Feeling themselves part of a special and closed community, they exchanged confidences secure in the knowledge, as they thought, that they were protected by that community from indiscretion.&quot; (192) </p>
	<p>The most hostile response to the new Labour government was <a href="BUharmsworth.htm" class="ajax">Lord Northcliffe</a>, the owner of several Conservative Party supporting newspapers. <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a> claimed: &quot;The British Labour Party, as it impudently calls itself, is not British at all. It has no right whatever to its name. By its humble acceptance of the domination of the Sozialistische Arbeiter Internationale's authority at Hamburg in May it has become a mere wing of the Bolshevist and Communist organisation on the Continent. It cannot act or think for itself.&quot; (193) </p>
	<p>Two days after forming the first Labour government <a href="PRmacdonald.htm" class="ajax">Ramsay MacDonald</a> received a note from General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Childs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Borlass Childs</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Branch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Special Branch</a> that said &quot;in accordance with custom&quot; a copy was enclosed of his weekly report on revolutionary movements in Britain. MacDonald wrote back that the weekly report would be more useful if it also contained details of the &quot;political activities... of the Fascist movement in this country&quot;. Childs wrote back that he had never thought it right to investigate movements which wished to achieve their aims peacefully. In reality, MI5 was already working very closely with the <a href="SSfascists.htm" class="ajax">British Fascisti</a>, that had been established in 1923. (194) </p>
	<p> <a href="SSknightM.htm" class="ajax">Maxwell Knight</a> was the organization's Director of Intelligence. In this role he had responsibility for compiling intelligence dossiers on its enemies; for planning counter-espionage and for establishing and supervising fascist cells operating in the trade union movement. This information was then passed onto <a href="SSkell.htm" class="ajax">Vernon Kell</a>, Director of the Home Section of the Secret Service Bureau (<a href="FWWm5.htm" class="ajax">MI5</a>). Later Maxwell Knight was placed in charge of B5b, a unit that conducted the monitoring of political subversion. (195) </p>
	<p>In September 1924 <a href="FWWm5.htm" class="ajax">MI5</a> intercepted a letter signed by <a href="TUzinoviev.htm" class="ajax">Grigory Zinoviev</a>, chairman of the <a href="RUScomintern.htm" class="ajax">Comintern</a> in the Soviet Union, and <a href="CRImcmanus.htm" class="ajax">Arthur McManus</a>, the British representative on the committee. In the letter British communists were urged to promote revolution through acts of sedition. <a href="SSsinclair.htm" class="ajax">Hugh Sinclair</a>, head of <a href="FWWm6.htm" class="ajax">MI6</a>, provided &quot;five very good reasons&quot; why he believed the letter was genuine. However, one of these reasons, that the letter came &quot;direct from an agent in Moscow for a long time in our service, and of proved reliability&quot; was incorrect. (196) </p>
	<p><a href="SSkell.htm" class="ajax">Vernon Kell</a>, the head of <a href="FWWm5.htm" class="ajax">MI5</a> and <a href="SSthomson.htm" class="ajax">Sir Basil Thomson</a> the head of Special Branch, were also convinced that the letter was genuine. <a href="SPYmorton.htm" class="ajax">Desmond Morton</a>, who worked for MI6, told Sir <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Crowe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eyre Crowe</a>, at the Foreign Office, that an agent, <a href="SSfindley.htm" class="ajax">Jim Finney</a>, who worked for <a href="SSmakgill.htm" class="ajax">George Makgill</a>, the head of the Industrial Intelligence Bureau (IIB), had penetrated <a href="RUScomintern.htm" class="ajax">Comintern</a> and the <a href="Pcommunist.htm" class="ajax">Communist Party of Great Britain</a>. Morton told Crowe that Finney &quot;had reported that a recent meeting of the Party Central Committee had considered a letter from Moscow whose instructions corresponded to those in the Zinoviev letter&quot;. However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andrew_(historian)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Andrew</a>, who examined all the files concerning the matter, claims that Finney's report of the meeting does not include this information. (197) </p>
	<p>Kell showed the letter to <a href="PRmacdonald.htm" class="ajax">Ramsay MacDonald</a>, the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour</a> Prime Minister. It was agreed that the letter should be kept secret until after the election. (198) Someone at MI5 leaked the letter to <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a>, and they published it on 25th October 1924, just four days before the <a href="GE1924.htm" class="ajax">1924 General Election</a>. Under the headline &quot;Civil War Plot by Socialists Masters&quot; it argued: &quot;Moscow issues orders to the British Communists... the British Communists in turn give orders to the Socialist Government, which it tamely and humbly obeys... Now we can see why Mr MacDonald has done obeisance throughout the campaign to the Red Flag with its associations of murder and crime. He is a stalking horse for the Reds as Kerensky was... Everything is to be made ready for a great outbreak of the abominable class war which is civil war of the most savage kind.&quot; (199) </p>
	<p>Ramsay MacDonald suggested he was a victim of a political conspiracy: &quot;I am also informed that the Conservative Headquarters had been spreading abroad for some days that... a mine was going to be sprung under our feet, and that the name of Zinoviev was to be associated with mine. Another Guy Fawkes - a new Gunpowder Plot... The letter might have originated anywhere. The staff of the Foreign Office up to the end of the week thought it was authentic... I have not seen the evidence yet. All I say is this, that it is a most suspicious circumstance that a certain newspaper and the headquarters of the Conservative Association seem to have had copies of it at the same time as the Foreign Office, and if that is true how can I avoid the suspicion - I will not say the conclusion - that the whole thing is a political plot?&quot; (200) </p>
	<p>The rest of the Tory owned newspapers ran the story of what became known as the <a href="TUzinoviev.htm" class="ajax">Zinoviev Letter</a> over the next few days and it was no surprise when the election was a disaster for the Labour Party. The <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservatives</a> won 412 seats and formed the next government. <a href="BUbeaverbrook.htm" class="ajax">Lord Beaverbrook</a>, the owner of the <a href="Jexpress.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Express</em></a> and <a href="Jstandard.htm" class="ajax"><em>Evening Standard</em></a>, told <a href="BUrothermere.htm" class="ajax">Lord Rothermere</a>, the owner of <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a>, that the &quot;Red Letter&quot; campaign had won the election for the Conservatives. Rothermere replied that it was probably worth a hundred seats. (201) </p>
	<p><a href="Jlow.htm" class="ajax">David Low</a> was a <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> supporter who was appalled by the tactics used by the Tory press in the 1924 General Election: &quot;Elections have never been completely free from chicanery, of course, but this one was exceptional. There were issues - unemployment, for instance, and trade. There were legitimate secondary issues - whether or not Russia should be afforded an export loan to stimulate trade. In the event these issues were distorted, pulped, and attached as appendix to a mysterious document subsequently held by many creditable persons to be a forgery, and the election was fought on &quot;red&quot; panic (The Zinoviev Letter)&quot;. (202) </p>
	<p>After the election it was claimed that two of MI5's agents, <a href="SSreilly.htm" class="ajax">Sidney Reilly</a> and <a href="SSgregory.htm" class="ajax">Arthur Maundy Gregory</a>, had forged the letter. It later became clear that Major <a href="CRIballJ.htm" class="ajax">George Joseph Ball</a>, a MI5 officer, played an important role in leaking it to the press. In 1927 Ball went to work for the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Central Office</a> where he pioneered the idea of spin-doctoring. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andrew_(historian)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Andrew</a>, MI5's official historian, points out: &quot;Ball's subsequent lack of scruples in using intelligence for party political advantage while at Central Office in the late 1920s strongly suggests... that he was willing to do so during the election campaign of October 1924.&quot; (203) </p>

	<p><a href="Jlow.htm" class="ajax">David Low</a> was convinced that the letter was a forgery and he started a campaign against Britain's two major press lords, <a href="BUrothermere.htm" class="ajax">Lord Rothermere</a> and <a href="BUbeaverbrook.htm" class="ajax">Lord Beaverbrook</a>. &quot;The figures, fat Rother and little Beaver, were such naturals to draw and the newspaper public gave them such popularity that in no time I found myself running a series dealing with their dark doings.

The Plot Press became one of my major properties and a regular feature of the <em>Star</em>.&quot; (204) </p>
	<p>Rotheremere's newspapers continued to increase their circulation. By 1926 the daily sales of the <i>Daily Mail</i> had reached 2,000,000. Lord Rothermere personal wealth was now &#163;25 million and he was estimated to be the third richest man in Britain. Rothermere became increasingly nationalistic in his political views and in 1929 joined with <a href="BUbeaverbrook.htm" class="ajax">Lord Beaverbrook</a> to form the United Empire Party. Rothermere urged the <a href="Pconservative.htm" class="ajax">Conservative Party</a> to remove its leader, <a href="PRbaldwin.htm" class="ajax">Stanley Baldwin</a>, and replace him with Beaverbrook. He also argued for a reform of the <a href="Plords.htm" class="ajax">House of Lords</a> to make it possible for peers to be elected to the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a>. This dispute divided conservative voters and this enabled the <a href="Plabour.htm" class="ajax">Labour Party</a> to win the <a href="GE1929.htm" class="ajax">1929 General Election</a>.</p>
	<p>The circulation of the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Mail</em></a> in 1930 was 1,845,000. <a href="Jexpress.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Express</em></a> (1,693,000), <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Chronicle</em></a> (1,400,000), <a href="Jherald.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Herald</em></a> (1,082,000), <a href="Jmirror.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mirror</em></a><a href="Jherald.htm" class="ajax"></a> (1,071,000), <a href="Jsketch.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Sketch</em></a> (1,013,000), <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> (187,000), <a href="Jmorning.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Morning Post</em></a> (119,000), <a href="Jtelegraph.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a> (90,000) and <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><em>Manchester Guardian</em></a> (47,000).

	<p>In the General Election that took place in September 1930, the <a href="GERnazi.htm" class="ajax">Nazi Party</a> increased its number of representatives in parliament from 14 to 107. <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a> was now the leader of the second largest party in Germany. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/James-Pool/e/B001HD02N4/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1380711520&amp;sr=1-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">James Pool</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Who+Financed+Hitler%3A+The+Secret+Funding+of+Hitler%27s+Rise+to+Power&amp;rh=n%3A266239%2Ck%3AWho+Financed+Hitler%3A+The+Secret+Funding+of+Hitler%27s+Rise+to+Power" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Who Financed Hitler: The Secret Funding of Hitler's Rise to Power</em></a> (1979) points out: &quot;Shortly after the Nazis' sweeping victory in the election of September 14, 1930, Rothermere went to Munich to have a long talk with Hitler, and ten days after the election wrote an article discussing the significance of the National Socialists' triumph. The article drew attention throughout England and the Continent because it urged acceptance of the Nazis as a bulwark against Communism... Rothermere continued to say that if it were not for the Nazis, the Communists might have gained the majority in the Reichstag.&quot; According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_P._Lochner" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Louis P.

	<p>Lord Rothermere disposed of his shares in the <i><a href="Jmirror.htm" class="ajax">Daily Mirror</a></i> in 1931. He now concentrated on the <em>Daily Mail </em>and the <a href="Jevening.htm" class="ajax"><i>Evening News</i></a>. In the 1930s Rothermere moved further to the right. When Hitler became Chancellor on 30th January 1933, Rothermere produced a series of articles acclaiming the new regime. The most famous of these was on the 10th July when he told readers that he &quot;confidently expected&quot; great things of the Nazi regime. He also criticised other newspapers for &quot;its obsession with Nazi violence and racialism&quot;, and assured his readers that any such deeds would be &quot;submerged by the immense benefits that the new regime is already bestowing on Germany.&quot; </p>
	<p>Rothermere now began a campaign in favour of the <a href="GERnazi.htm" class="ajax">Nazi Party</a>. The <em>Daily Mail </em>criticized &quot;the old women of both sexes&quot; who filled British newspapers with rabid reports of Nazi &quot;excesses.&quot; Instead, the newspaper claimed, Hitler had saved Germany from &quot;Israelites of international attachments&quot; and the &quot;minor misdeeds of individual Nazis will be submerged by the immense benefits that the new regime is already bestowing upon Germany.&quot;</p>
	<p><a href="George_Ward_Price.htm" class="ajax">George Ward Price</a>, the <em>Daily Mail</em>'s foreign correspondent developed a very close relationship with <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a>.

His paper supported Hitler more strongly and more constantly than any other newspaper outside Germany.&quot; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Franklin-Reid-Gannon/e/B001HPXRHA/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Franklin Reid Gannon</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/British-Germany-1936-39-Franklin-Gannon/dp/0198214901/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1381689385&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=The+British+Press+and+Germany" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The British Press and Germany</em></a> (1971), has claimed that Hitler regarded him as &quot;the only foreign journalist who reported him without prejudice&quot;.

	<p><a href="BUrothermere.htm" class="ajax">Lord Rothermere</a>  also had several meetings with <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a> and argued that the Nazi leader desired peace. In one article written in March, 1934 he called for Hitler to be given back land in Africa that had been taken as a result of the <a href="FWWversailles.htm" class="ajax">Versailles Treaty</a>. Hitler acknowledged this help by writing to Rothermere: &quot;I should like to express the appreciation of countless Germans, who regard me as their spokesman, for the wise and beneficial public support which you have given to a policy that we all hope will contribute to the enduring pacification of Europe. Just as we are fanatically determined to defend ourselves against attack, so do we reject the idea of taking the initiative in bringing about a war. I am convinced that no one who fought in the front trenches during the world war, no matter in what European country, desires another conflict.&quot; </p>

	<p>As Richard Griffiths, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Fellow%20Travellers%20of%20the%20Right%20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fellow Travellers of the Right</em></a> (1979) has pointed out: &quot;Rothermere visited Hitler on a number of occasions, and corresponded with him. As we have seen, Hitler's first major dinner party for foreigners, on 19th December 1934, had as its guests of honour Rothermere, his son Esmond Harmsworth, and Ward Price, together with Ernest Tennant. Rothermere's subsequent article in the <em>Daily Mail</em> was violently enthusiastic about what Hitler had done for Germany. Hitler wrote a number of important letters to Rothermere in 1933 and 1934, but the most interesting of them, because of its subsequent fate, was the one written on 3 May 1935 in which he advocated Anglo-German understanding as a firm combination for peace. Rothermere circulated this to many politicians, convinced that his personal contact with Hitler had produced a real breakthrough.&quot; </p>
</section><section id="section15"><header><h5>The Daily Mail and Oswald Mosley </h5></header>
	<p><a href="BUrothermere.htm" class="ajax">Lord Rothermere</a>  also gave full support to <a href="PRmosley.htm" class="ajax">Oswald Mosley</a> and the <a href="Pfascists.htm" class="ajax">National Union of Fascists</a>. He wrote an article, <em>Hurrah for the Blackshirts</em>, on 22nd January, 1934, in which he praised Mosley for his &quot;sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine&quot;. Rothermere added: &quot;Timid alarmists all this week have been whimpering that the rapid growth in numbers of the British Blackshirts is preparing the way for a system of rulership by means of steel whips and concentration camps. Very few of these panic-mongers have any personal knowledge of the countries that are already under Blackshirt government. The notion that a permanent reign of terror exists there has been evolved entirely from their own morbid imaginations, fed by sensational propaganda from opponents of the party now in power. As a purely British organization, the Blackshirts will respect those principles of tolerance which are traditional in British politics. They have no prejudice either of class or race. Their recruits are drawn from all social grades and every political party. Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King's Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.&quot;</p>

	<p><i>The Daily Mail</i> continued to give its support to the fascists. <a href="George_Ward_Price.htm" class="ajax">George Ward Price</a> wrote about anti-fascist demonstrators at a meeting of the <a href="Pfascists.htm" class="ajax">National Union of Fascists</a> on 8th June, 1934: &quot;If the Blackshirts movement had any need of justification, the Red Hooligans who savagely and systematically tried to wreck Sir Oswald Mosley's huge and magnificently successful meeting at Olympia last night would have supplied it.

	<p><a href="Jlow.htm" class="ajax">David Low</a>, a cartoonist employed by the <a href="Jstandard.htm" class="ajax"><em>Evening Standard</em></a>, made several attacks on Rothermere's links to the fascist movement.

It later emerged that Rothermere was paying a retainer of &pound;5,000 per year (&pound;200,000 in today's money) to Princess <a href="Stephanie_von_Hohenlohe.htm" class="ajax">Stephanie von Hohenlohe</a>, a close confidante of <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a href="GERgoebbels.htm" class="ajax">Joseph Goebbels</a>, <a href="2WWgoring.htm" class="ajax">Hermann Goering</a>, <a href="GERhimmler.htm" class="ajax">Heinrich Himmler</a> and <a href="GERribbentrop.htm" class="ajax">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a>. According to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1484647/When-Rothermere-urged-Hitler-to-invade-Romania.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a>: &quot;In 1933, the year that Hitler gained power, MI6 circulated a report stating that the French secret service had discovered documents in the princess's flat in Paris ordering her to persuade Rothermere to campaign for the return to Germany of territory ceded to Poland at the end of First World War. She was to receive &pound;300,000 &ndash; equal to &pound;13 million today if she succeeded.&quot;</p>

	<p><a href="George_Ward_Price.htm" class="ajax">George Ward Price</a>, <a href="BUrothermere.htm" class="ajax">Lord Rothermere</a> and Princess <a href="Stephanie_von_Hohenlohe.htm" class="ajax">Stephanie von Hohenlohe</a> were invited to spend time with Hitler at his holiday retreat, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kehlsteinhaus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Eagle's Nest</a>, in the mountains above <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berchtesgaden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Berchtesgaden</a>. Also invited was <a href="GERgoebbels.htm" class="ajax">Joseph Goebbels</a>. He wrote in his diary: &quot;Rothermere pays me great compliments... Enquires in detail about German press policy. Strongly anti-Jewish. The princess is very pushy. After lunch we retire for a chat. Question of Spain comes up. F&uuml;hrer won't tolerate a hot-bed of communism in Europe any longer. Is ready to prevent any more pro-Republican volunteers from going there. His proposal on controls seem to astonish Rothermere. German prestige is thus restored. Franco will win anyway... Rothermere believes British government also pro-Franco.&quot; </p>
	<p><a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a> was kept informed about what British newspapers were saying about him. He was usually very pleased by what appeared in <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mail</em></a>. On 20th May 1937 he wrote to Lord Rothermere: &quot;Your leading articles published within the last few weeks, which I read with great interest, contain everything that corresponds to my own thoughts as well.&quot; Hitler told George Ward Price: &quot;He (Lord Rothermere) is the only Englishman who sees clearly the magnitude of this Bolshevist danger. His paper is doing an immense amount of good.&quot;</p>
</section><section id="section17"><header><h5>George Ward Price </h5></header>
	<p>In 1937 <a href="George_Ward_Price.htm" class="ajax">George Ward Price</a> of <em>The Daily Mail</em> published his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=I%20Know%20These%20Dictators" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>I Know These Dictators</em></a>. It was full of praise of Hitler: &quot;Behind the forceful character which he displays in public he had a human, pleasant personality... He had the artistic, visionary tendencies of the South German type... and there was a strong strain of sadness and tenderness in his disposition... Hitler had... a fondness for children and dogs... His personality and prestige were so strong that without any effort on his part, he is surrounded by much awe on the part of his entourage... Hitler is a widely read man... familiar with the works of the leading German philosophers who had mastered the history, geography and social and economic conditions of the chief European countries.&quot;</p>
	<p>Ward Price defended Hitler's treatment of Jews, trade unionists and socialists in <a href="GERnazigermany.htm" class="ajax">Nazi Germany</a>: &quot;To law-abiding citizens the Nazi Government brought public order, political peace, better living-conditions, and the promise, some fulfilled, to make Germany once more a great nation... Upon the people who opposed, or looked like opposing, its plans, it laid a heavy hand... The jockey who pats his horse in the paddock may lash him in a hard finish. The rulers of Germany were stern because they believed the fate of their country was at stake. If they failed, the gates would be open wide to Bolshevism - the same bloodthirsty Bolshevism which had ravaged and liquidated in Russia, tortured and massacred in Hungary.... The tolerant attitude of the average Anglo-Saxon... toward Jews, Communists, and those deluded intellectuals indulgently termed 'parlour-Bolshevists' appears in Nazi eyes as stupid apathy in the presence of real danger.&quot; </p>
	<p>According to Richard Griffiths, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Fellow%20Travellers%20of%20the%20Right%20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fellow Travellers of the Right</em></a> (1979): &quot;Rothermere and Ward Price, then, used the <em>Daily Mail</em>, up to 1938, as an instrument of Nazi propaganda. As Franklin Gannon points out, there was little news coverage of Germany in that paper (compared with the extensive coverage in other papers), and opinions on Germany were expressed mainly through editorials and reports of Ward Price's interviews. As the thirties wore on, the paper's main concern turned gradually from positive praise of Nazism to a concern to avoid Continental obligations.&quot;</p>
</section><section id="section18"><header><h5>The Daily Mail &amp; Appeasement </h5></header>
	<p>Rothermere and his newspapers supported <a href="PRchamberlain.htm" class="ajax">Neville Chamberlain</a> and his policy of appeasement. When Hitler marched into <a href="2WWczech.htm" class="ajax">Czechoslovakia</a> in March 1938 he sent a telegram to <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a> saying: &quot;My dear Fuhrer everyone in England is profoundly moved by the bloodless solution to the Czechoslovakian problem. People not so much concerned with territorial readjustment as with dread of another war with its accompanying bloodbath. Frederick the Great was a great popular figure. I salute your excellency's star which rises higher and higher.&quot;</p>
	<p>MI6 continued to investigate <a href="Stephanie_von_Hohenlohe.htm" class="ajax">Stephanie von Hohenlohe</a>. In March 1939 the <a href="FWWm6.htm" class="ajax">MI6</a> passport control officer at Victoria Station arrested her Hungarian lawyer, <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_inalienable_rights_of_aliens.html?id=0ko0AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Erno Wittman</a>. The arresting officer reported what he discovered that Wittman was carrying: &quot;This was astonishing; it appeared to be copies of documents and letters which passed between Lord Rothermere, Lady Snowden, Princess Stephanie, Herr Hitler and others. In the main, the letters referred to the possible restoration of the throne in Hungary and shed a good deal of light on the character and activities of the princess.&quot; It was decided to pass on this information to MI5. Amongst the documents were several letters from Lord Rothermere to Adolf Hitler. This included a &quot;a very indiscreet letter to the Fuhrer congratulating him on his walk into Prague&quot;. The letter urged Hitler to follow up his coup with the invasion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Romania</a>.</p>
	<p>The support for far-right had an impact on the circulation of the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Mail</em></a>. By 1939 sales had fallen to 1,533,000. It was <a href="Jexpress.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Express</em></a>  that had the largest circulation (2,546,000) followed by <a href="Jherald.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Herald</em></a> (1,850,000), <a href="Jmirror.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mirror</em></a> (1,571,000), <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Chronicle</em></a> (1,570,000), <a href="Jsketch.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Sketch</em></a> (750,000), <a href="Jtelegraph.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a> (737,000), <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a>  (204,000) and <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Manchester Guardian</em></a> (51,000). (206) </p>
	<p>On 4th September, 1939, the morning after the outbreak of the <a href="2WW.htm" class="ajax">Second World War</a>, Rothermere's <em>Daily Mail</em> had a powerful patriotic leader: &quot;No statesman, no man with any decency could think of sitting at the same table with Hitler or his henchman the trickster von Ribbentrop, or any other of the gang. We fight against the blackest tyranny that has ever held men in bondage. We fight to defend and to restore freedom and justice on earth.&quot; </p>
	<p>However, a few days later, <a href="BUrothermere.htm" class="ajax">Lord Rothermere</a> had his close colleague and &quot;ghost&quot;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Brooks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collin Brooks</a>, draft a letter to <a href="PRchamberlain.htm" class="ajax">Neville Chamberlain</a> urging the futility of trying to save <a href="RUSpoland.htm" class="ajax">Poland</a> and warning that &quot;whether victorious or not, Britain will emerge from such a conflict with her social and economic fabric destroyed&quot;, which could mean &quot;a revolution of the Left in these islands, which might be more deadly than the war itself&quot;. According to Rothermere's biographer, D. George Boyce: &quot;But the letter was never sent (despite Rothermere's fear that Britain was &lsquo;finished&rsquo;), because of the &lsquo;national mood and temper&rsquo;, a nice example of the would-be opinion leader and press baron being led by the public itself.&quot;</p>
	<p>Three weeks after the outbreak of the <a href="2WW.htm" class="ajax">Second World War</a> Rothermere's lawyers attempted to have the legal action stopped. A member of his law firm went to the Home Office and denounced Princess <a href="Stephanie_von_Hohenlohe.htm" class="ajax">Stephanie von Hohenlohe</a>  as a German agent and suggested that she should be deported. If the case reached open court it would receive huge publicity and would undermine public morale. However, the Home Office came to the conclusion that it would be improper to intervene. </p>
	<p>The case reached the High Court on 8th November, 1939. Princess Stephanie's case was that in 1932, when Rothermere had promised to engage her as his European political representative on an annual salary of &pound;5,000, she had understood the engagement was ongoing. She made it clear to the judge that if she lost the case she would not hesitate to publish her memoirs in America. This story would reveal Lord Rothermere's relationship with Hitler and his &quot;numerous, often indiscreet, liaisons with women&quot;. </p>
	<p>Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jowitt,_1st_Earl_Jowitt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">William Jowitt</a> asked Princess Stephanie if she had used the services of <a href="Fritz_Wiedemann.htm" class="ajax">Fritz Wiedemann</a> to put pressure on Lord Rothermere. She replied: &quot;I have not.&quot; Then a letter from Wiedemann to Lord Rothermere was read out in court. It included the following passage: &quot;You know that the F&uuml;hrer greatly appreciates the work the princess did to straighten relations between our countries... it was her groundwork which made the Munich agreement possible.&quot; However, the judge would not allow Princess Stephanie to read out the letters exchanged by Lord Rothermere and Hitler. </p>
	<p>Lord Rothermere, who had engaged a legal team of seventeen to mount his defence, told the judge, it was preposterous that he had agreed to support Princess Stephanie &quot;for the rest of her life&quot;. He admitted that between 1932 and 1938 he had paid her considerably more than &pound;51,000 (almost &pound;2 million in today's money). He added that she was always &quot;pestering and badgering me&quot; for money. That is why he sent her away to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Berlin</a> to be with Hitler. </p>
	<p>Jowitt told the court that Princess Stephanie had his client's letters photocopied behind his back by the Special Photographic Bureau of the Department of the German Chancellor. He also defended Rothermere's right to enter into negotiations with Hitler in an effort to prevent a war between the two countries. &quot;Who can say whether if Lord Rothermere had succeeded in the endeavours which he made, we might not be in the position in which we are today?&quot;</p>
	<p>After six days of legal argument Justice Tucker ruled against Princess Stephanie. Soon after the trial finished, Lord Rothermere used Lady <a href="Wsnowden.htm" class="ajax">Ethel Snowden</a> as an intermediary and sent Stephanie a message to say he would meet all her legal costs if she undertook to get out of the country. This she agreed to do but he thought she was going back to Europe instead of going to the United States to publish her account of her relationship with Rothermere. However, he was able to use his considerable power to make sure her memoirs were never published. A MI5 officer recorded that Lord Rothermere had probably &quot;offered her a considerable sum to leave the country&quot;. </p>
</section><section id="section19"><header><h5>Lord Rothermere accused of Treason </h5></header>
	<p>The court case revealed that Lord Rothermere had been involved in secret negotiations with <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a>. One newspaper, <a href="http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Yorkshire Post</em></a>, raised serious questions about this issue: &quot;The danger of these negotiations was two-fold. There was first the danger that Lord Rothermere might unwittingly give the Nazis a misleading impression of the state of opinion in this country; and there was also the danger that Lord Rothermere might - again unwittingly - allow himself to be used as a vehicle for the extremely subtle manoeuvres of Nazi propaganda.... discussions with heads of foreign governments are best left of persons whose status is on both sides clearly understood. A newspaper owner has great responsibilities towards the public of his own country; he should be particularly chary of placing himself in situations liable to misinterpretation, or abuse abroad.&quot; </p>
	<p>In the <a href="Pcommons.htm" class="ajax">House of Commons</a> the <a href="Pliberal.htm" class="ajax">Liberal Party</a> MP, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Mander" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Geoffrey Le Mesurier Mander</a>, asked the Home Secretary, <a href="TUmorrison.htm" class="ajax">Herbert Morrison</a>, why Princess Stephanie, a &quot;notorious member of the Hitler spy organisation&quot; was being allowed to leave the country. Morrison replied that he needed notice of the question but in any case she had been granted only a &quot;no return&quot; permit and there were no circumstances in which she would be allowed to return to Britain. Princess Stephanie went to live in <a href="USAsanfrancisco.htm" class="ajax">San Francisco</a>. Tipped off by <a href="FWWm6.htm" class="ajax">MI6</a>, the <a href="USAfbi.htm" class="ajax">FBI</a> put her under surveillance. A memo to President <a href="USArooseveltF.htm" class="ajax">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> described her as a spy &quot;more dangerous than ten thousand men&quot;. </p>
	<p>Lord Rothermere was now aware that MI5 had copies of his letters to <a href="GERhitler.htm" class="ajax">Adolf Hitler</a>. Fearing that he might be arrested for treason and decided to go and live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bermuda</a> where he died on 26th November 1940.</p>
	<p>In 1947 the circulation of the <a href="Jmail.htm" class="ajax"><em>Daily Mail</em></a> was 2,076,000. The sales figures of the other newspapers included <a href="Jexpress.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Express</em></a> (3,855,000), <a href="Jmirror.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Mirror</em></a> (3,702,000), <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em></em></a> <a href="Jherald.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Herald</em></a> (2,134,000), <a href="JchronicleD.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Chronicle</em></a> (1,623,000), <a href="Jsketch.htm" class="ajax"><em></em></a><a href="Jtelegraph.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Telegraph</em></a> (1,015,000), <a href="Jsketch.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Sketch</em></a> (772,000), <a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em></em></a><a href="PRtimes.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Times</em></a> (268,000), <a href="PRguardian.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Manchester Guardian</em></a> (126,000) and <a href="Daily_Worker.htm" class="ajax"><em>The Daily Worker</em></a> (118,000). </p>

I shall try to get in with him. We could start one of these papers for a couple of thousand pounds, and we ought to be able to find the money. At any rate, I am going to make the attempt.</p>

It is the use of these new inventions on a scale unprecedented in any English newspaper office that enables the <i>Daily Mail</i> to effect a saving of from 30 to 50 per cent and be sold for half the price of its contemporaries. That is the whole explanation of what otherwise appear a mystery.</p>

	<p>The German Army is the post perfectly adapted, perfectly running machine. Never can there have been a more signal triumph of organisation over complexity. The armies of other nations are not so completely organized. The German Army is the finest thing of its kind in the world; it is the finest thing in Germany of any kind. Briefly, the difference between the German and, for instance, the English armies is a simple one. The German Army is organised with a view to war, with the cold, hard, practical, business-like purpose of winning victories. And what should we ever do if 100,000 of this kind of army got loose in England?</p>

	<blockquote>
	<p>The New Journalism had arrived, and the <i>Daily Mail</i> under Alfred Harmsworth for whom I worked was its founder and pioneer. There were violent critics of this new type of journalism. They thought it vulgar, trashy, and lacking altogether in the dignity of the old-time Press. But Alfred Harmsworth knew what he was doing, and did it with genius. He knew that a public had grown up which took an intelligent interest in things not previously considered part of newspaper chronicles. Food; fashions; the drama of life in low places as well as high; sport of all kinds; the human story wherever it might be found; the adventure of science as it affected everyday life. Harmsworth knew that women's interests had been left out mainly from the old fashioned newspapers, and he knew that here was an enormous field for increasing circulation.</p>

	<p>I was the special correspondent with the largest newspaper public in existence to address, and a fairly free hand as to what I would write about and how. From that time until the war I had as good a life as ever fell to the lot of any journalist in any land. To travel had been my hope - more than that, it had been my determination. In my holidays I had got as far afield as I could. Now travel was to be my occupation, my livelihood.</p>
	<p>As a method of enhancing the prestige of the paper, it was impressed on all connected with it that they must on all occasions wear the correct clothes, be seen in only exclusive places of resort, give the impression that they were accustomed to the habits of the wealthy and fashionable. This was the resolved commercial policy of Northcliffe, and from the commercial angle a very sound policy. His idea from the beginning, even when people were ashamed to be seen with the <i>Mail </i>and business men took it home under their coats, was that it should seem to be produced for the rich and privileged. This had its effect, as he knew it would, on advertisers. It resulted, too, in making the paper eventually what it had all along aimed at being - an organ of the well-to-do.</p>

	<p>I evaded the authorities in France and Flanders in 1914-1915 for five months - going to the Front on average two or three times a week. I had apartments or hotel rooms in three districts, and when things became hot in one place I moved to another of my bases.</p>

He was warned repeatedly that the kind of shell required was a violently explosive bomb which would dynamite its way through the German trenches and entanglements and enable our brave men to advance in safety.
