Missing that one important email because your inbox is cluttered with garbage. \nBut it doesn't have to be that way. \nSEE ALSO: The best thing you can do to protect yourself from hackers\nThankfully, there are numerous tricks you can use to make sure that you see the emails you want to see, when you want to see them. While the specifics of your digital streamlining will vary depending on your email provider of choice, that's OK! We're here to break it all down for you, nice and easy like. \nGmail\nGoogle's Gmail offers up numerous options to flag important incoming emails, and even employs one of them by default. The default flag is called an \"importance marker,\" and it's slapped on an email after Google's fancy algorithms have used a variety of factors to determine that it's worth giving a damn about. \nThose factors include, but are not limited to, practical considerations like \"who you email, and how often you email them,\" \"which emails you open,\" and \"which emails you reply to.\"\nIf Google does decide an email is worthy of an importance marker, you'll see what looks like a little rightward-facing arrow in your inbox pointing to the message in question. If you only want to see emails marked in this way, search \"is:important\" in your inbox search bar. \nBut what if this default option isn't a good fit? What if Gmail's importance markers miss your actually important stuff and only serve to confuse you? \nThat's totally cool, because there are more tools in the Gmail toolshed.\n\nYour first step after deciding to ditch importance markers should be to disable the feature. You can do this by logging into your account (via browser) and clicking on the gear icon in the upper-right corner. Next, select \"settings\" and then click \"inbox.\" Scroll down to \"importance markers\" and select \"no markers.\" \nThat's it. You're free of Google deciding what emails you should read, and, conversely, what you should ignore. \nThe magic of filters\nThat means it's time to set up your own filters. The obvious one it to mark specific people as being really important: Your boss, your partner, your best friend, or your lawyer are people whose emails you wouldn't want to miss. \nThe steps to mark specific senders as important are relatively straightforward. First, type the person's email address in your browser search bar. After you search for them, select the \"more\" drop-down menu then choose \"create filter.\" The next part looks tricky, but if you've made it this far into this story you can definitely manage. Make sure the important email address is in the \"from\" field, and then select \"create filter with this search.\" \nThe next screen gives you the option to have Gmail star future message from that sender, mark them as important, or to make sure those messages stay out of the spam folder. For truly important people, we recommend you check all three.\n\nDon't forget to hit \"create filter,\" and you're done. \nEasy, right? Now you'll never miss another vital email in your Gmail account (jk — you totally still will every now and then, but that's because you're a human being).\nOutlook Mail\nMicrosoft makes it easy to designate emails as deserving of special attention, and goes one step further by allowing you to automatically pin messages to the top of your inbox. \nThat's right, whenever that email from your mom comes in it will stay front and center. \nTo turn on auto-pin, search for an email from said mom (she's bound to have sent you at least one) and, once you have it open, click on the \"more commands\" ellipsis in the toolbar. Next, choose \"create rule\" and make sure the condition for \"it was received from\" is both selected and has your mom's name in it. Then, remove any conditions that don't apply and then click the \"move the message to folder\" drop-down menu. After selecting \"pin the message,\" don't forget to hit \"OK\" in the upper-left hand corner. \nYou have now mastered the Outlook Mail pin.\nTo designate a specific sender as important you can follow the same pinning steps up until the last part, and instead of selecting \"pin the message\" just choose the \"mark the message\" \"with importance\" option. \nBoom. Easy. Kinda.\nYahoo! Mail\nThe first, and perhaps most important step you should take when using Yahoo! Mail is to stop using Yahoo! Mail (we only sort of kid). If you like the interface for whatever reason, or just don't want to give up that totally sick \"yournamecool@yahoo.com\" handle then there are some measures you can take to prioritize messages from the all stars in your life. \n\nStart things off by creating a new folder in your inbox and titling it something like \"Boss Baby.\" Next, make sure emails from any important people are automatically sent to that folder. \nIt's simple enough to do: Open an email from one of your very Boss Baby-like friends or colleagues and select the \"more\" drop-down menu. \nNow, click on \"filter emails like this.\" The \"from\" field should include the address of your special person (you can add more than one address in the field), and, when you've added all the appropriate email addresses, choose your folder labeled \"Boss Baby\" from the \"then move the message to this folder\" drop-down tab. Lastly, click \"save\" and you're good to go!\nYou still have a Yahoo! Mail account, but at least it's modestly organized now. \nThe ugly truth\nThe reality of email these days is that even with the above steps, stuff you actually give a hoot about is still going to get lost in the mix. With that in mind, the best approach is might actually be to have multiple email accounts (I have five that I use regularly, and several other throwaways). \nIt sounds like a pain, but it's not really. Almost everyone reading this likely has at least two different email accounts (work and personal) already. Try breaking out your personal accounts into themed groups. One account could be tied to all your social media accounts, a second tied to your friends, family, and banking, and yet another for any service or list that you need to sign up for. Then, within each account, go ahead and follow the steps outlined earlier in this piece. \nThis approach will take you a while to set up, but it is oh so sweet when you have it dialed in. And when you finally do, you can rest easy knowing that no notification from Facebook will ever again drown out that email from Grandma.\nWATCH: Man convinces email scammer he's flown to Hong Kong for Kit Kats and $13.9 million"},"shares":{"facebook":440,"pinterest":13,"linked_in":124,"google_plus":58,"twitter":821,"total":1456},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/R3iITHedddANphM6xwXceqVi1hY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F464776%2F4339f6f1-347c-46f9-a0c5-0791c08bd67c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xnYBskYx1HlNn1dJWoemiXUifZ0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/29rlTLM04Obf1C7lhU9-bFuibB4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/T-bZXW-kN8_6PHhHzHDy3NBV8vI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/aRYYXZBgXOKv2UlFbrGfK7PQCvk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oUf7-evI690nYxam40gv_v2y10Y=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44532%2Fce089c6a-f5d6-46b2-ac29-b6ddd271380a.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pUia99","display_title":"How to fix your chaotic nightmare of an email inbox","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"kqNR7cSt","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Email is messy, but it doesn't have to be.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"How to fix your chaotic nightmare of an email inbox"},{"_id":"585708e5f11b2c1fa7003dc4","id":"2016/12/18/los-angeles-county-email-hack","title":"LA County email hack exposes data of 750,000 people","title_tag":null,"author":"Maria Gallucci","post_date":"2016-12-18T22:08:34+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 22:08:34 +0000","formatted_date":"12/18/2016","formatted_shares":"981","sort_key":"1CiK8F","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/12/18/los-angeles-county-email-hack/","content":{"plain":"Los Angeles County appears to be the latest victim of a wide-reaching email hack.\nAround 756,000 people who had business with county departments may have had their personal information or confidential health data exposed through the breach, officials said.\nThe L.A.

The company said the breach was likely separate from a late-2014 attack that affected more than 500 million accounts and may have been the work of a \"state-sponsored actor.\"\nWeeks before the U.S. elections, hackers released thousands of emails from the inbox of John Podesta, who chaired Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and was the apparent victim of an email phishing ploy. \nAnd in Madison County, Indiana, where the stakes were drastically lower, hackers broke into the county government's website and held critical information hostage. County commissioners last month said they would pay a ransom to the cyber thieves to retrieve the stolen data, the Herald Bulletin newspaper reported.\nAt North Carolina State University in Raleigh, officials in July said an email account containing the personal data of about 38,000 people was illegally accessed through a \"sophisticated phishing scam.\"\nThe Los Angeles County employees were similarly deceived by an email attack. \nThe D.A.'s office said 108 employees were tricked into providing their usernames and passwords. Some of those officials had \"confidential client/patient information\" in their email accounts through their county duties.\nThe office's Cyber Crime Division said it is offering free monitoring to people whose information may have been exposed, including credit monitoring.\nOnaghinor, the alleged hacker, faces 13 years in California prison if convicted. \nBONUS: The best way to understand encryption is through this tale of love and mystery"},"shares":{"twitter":645,"facebook":310,"google_plus":26,"total":981},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zl9xs8Pr_cxttt1WFEUaGub94sk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F321961%2F94fd8181-11e7-4445-aef9-5c48c22a86cd.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gpqDOpoGbAr1ZBO6CWdNlE9yyfk=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31246%2F4c72de06-7e22-4862-8ec1-32480e39df5f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BeG0pgx1m436yNo2pGDL0kVUdRA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31246%2F4c72de06-7e22-4862-8ec1-32480e39df5f.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/41S8D5oRsOCI63HF6xkHUDACWjM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31246%2F4c72de06-7e22-4862-8ec1-32480e39df5f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oSYCkNXi3kLqgAAoIxAneW-SFlQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31246%2F4c72de06-7e22-4862-8ec1-32480e39df5f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6zQD6HS0ifsALzirl1rtcUgv3j4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31246%2F4c72de06-7e22-4862-8ec1-32480e39df5f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hxUV2p","display_title":"LA County email hack exposes data of 750,000 people","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"1On8N6eoBv","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Yet another organization falls victim to a phishing scam.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/","tweet_text":"LA County email hack exposes data of 750,000 people"},{"_id":"57ef01446df61237e00007de","id":"2016/09/30/yahoo-hack-billions","title":"Yahoo hack could have affected billions of accounts, former exec claims","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2016-10-01T00:20:14+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 01 Oct 2016 00:20:14 +0000","formatted_date":"10/01/2016","formatted_shares":"1.0k","sort_key":"1BQjZC","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/09/30/yahoo-hack-billions/","content":{"plain":"The Yahoo breach could have affected more accounts than previously reported.\nYahoo confirmed last week that data from at least 500 million user accounts had been stolen in the company's network from late 2014. \nHowever, the number of affected accounts may be between 1 billion and 3 billion, Business Insider reported Friday, citing one former Yahoo executive who is familiar with the company's security and still speaks to employees at the company. \nSEE ALSO: What this Yahoo data breach means for you\nThe hack could be much larger than Yahoo has said due to how the company stores information on and authenticates users. All of Yahoo's products were affected by the breach and are tied to one user database, the unnamed source said. \nThat central database is what got compromised, and therefore, this executive believes that the scale is much larger than Yahoo reported. \nIt is important to note that Business Insider only cited one former executive, and it is unclear his or her motivations. \nYahoo declined to share specifics on how its network architecture works in a request from Mashable. \nYahoo had an estimated 700 million to 1 billion monthly active users in 2014, at the time of the hack. That number does not include inactive accounts.  \nEven though the hacker may have had access to more user data, there's a chance it was not all breached. \nA Yahoo spokesperson declined to comment on the report and noted that this is an ongoing investigation to Mashable. \nSEE ALSO: How to check if you've been the victim of a breach like the Yahoo hack\n\"Based on the ongoing investigation, Yahoo believes that information associated with at least 500 million user accounts was stolen and the investigation has found no evidence that the state-sponsored actor is currently in Yahoo's network,\" Yahoo wrote in its press release last week. \nAlready, the hack is believed to be one of the biggest in history. \nVerizon is still in the midst of an acquisition of Yahoo's core business for $4.83 billion. "},"shares":{"linked_in":33,"twitter":784,"facebook":210,"google_plus":13,"pinterest":1,"total":1041},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Mnw2StXxl8mp_lsIxhfp2uoGvMo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F231217%2FGettyImages-148470915.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AJWvTX9u1Z7ff3cTOb5YQwrs1to=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F22939%2FGettyImages-148470915.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MEt6TSg6RGoXhYbKUOBIpFoqYaU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F22939%2FGettyImages-148470915.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TcmaAhsAtxV1QxXmBE3a9HQqO8k=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F22939%2FGettyImages-148470915.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6JbO73HIFwF8ApN2Ou3APD3S29Y=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F22939%2FGettyImages-148470915.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/M7ULnLzQOOo7_FDxOzJTSrAJhxo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F22939%2FGettyImages-148470915.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2cHfAjr","display_title":"Yahoo hack could have affected billions of accounts, former exec claims","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Yahoo claimed last week at least 500 million accounts had been affected.

The site will tell you when the breach occurred and exactly what information was impacted. \nYou can also sign up for alerts tied to your email address so you can be notified as soon as another breach is detected. \nWhile there could still be other sources of personal information out there, Hunt's website is by far the most comprehensive of its kind, so it's not a bad idea to run your email addresses through it every once in awhile. "},"shares":{"twitter":1688,"facebook":2496,"linked_in":267,"google_plus":39,"pinterest":20,"total":4510},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Iz94AE3_atNjobEd_ww6cPIHVHY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F220616%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VPLEoHnctNMDiONurkjJX6RPMEA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qnvyAC-zRQhYs5HYvZWE5NrAkUI=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1jz8N2Ysa7nItb9Cs5PV9g9iyuA=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/frbdr-ARcDYjmm1mihoxxAepjw0=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1aq4k6qo-34ZQG06HwnDRnINNw8=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21886%2F7e720c4ae93d464c8119439d958e4379.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2cVkhF7","display_title":"How to check if you've been the victim of a breach like the Yahoo hack","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Have you been hacked?

That means passwords may not have been leaked, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't change them.\nSEE ALSO: Yahoo confirms massive leak of 500 million user accounts\nYahoo is expected to notify any potentially affected users, but anyone can follow these steps to better secure their accounts. \n1. Update your Yahoo accounts\nYahoo has invalidated unencrypted security questions of those users it believes have been affected. Affected users will need to update their accounts, but anyone should go and change their password, especially if it hasn't been updated since 2014 when the breach occurred.\n2. Change your passwords, security questions that match Yahoo's\nIf you use the same or similar passwords and security questions on multiple services, those have potentially now been exposed. Take this as an opportunity to do what you should probably have already done -- go to those accounts and change those questions. \nTake this data breach, and the many breaches that have come before it, as a lesson to use different passwords on the service you use. \n3. Use a password manager like LastPass\nUsing the same password is easy. Keeping track of passwords can be difficult. You can eliminate that burden by using a password management system like LastPass, 1Password and Dashlane. \nThese password managers only require users to have one master password and then suggests, encrypts and stores passwords for other sites and services.  \n4. Enable two-step authentication\nTwo-step authentication or verification is one of the best and easiest ways to provide an additional level. By enabling this service, you can request to receive a text message or call to your phone that includes a string of numbers you need to enter before logging in. \nFor Yahoo accounts, you can find the instructions here. You should also do this for all your other accounts on everything you use, everything you ever will use, and probably anything your kids, relatives or even casual work acquintances use.\n\n5. Use Yahoo Account Key\nYahoo offers its own service called Account Key that eliminates the need to remember a password. Instead, users receive a notification on their smartphone and can tap yes to sign in. \nYou can set up Account Key here. \n6. Stop using Yahoo \nThe hack is over -- well, it was actually done back in 2014. But this also provides an opportunity to reconsider why you use Yahoo. There are plenty of other email clients like Gmail and Outlook. For photo storage, you can try 500px instead of Flickr. "},"shares":{"twitter":956,"facebook":7408,"linked_in":223,"google_plus":35,"pinterest":2,"total":8624},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bkRX8MTNOem0z3W_rFJowjmVbmw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F220228%2FGettyImages-461368785.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/sNPYcqRhK_BKVF4dvbSaV3eyLpU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21836%2FGettyImages-461368785.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zlyXDdmjq7UnrD6PrVoqtv6WKs0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21836%2FGettyImages-461368785.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/W4kQvqUcrYHJ7Npl5Z3VJdModE0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21836%2FGettyImages-461368785.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/W_MpiQbgUtd2VOi8hJYQbHZxLZg=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21836%2FGettyImages-461368785.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nURNi3T1sGmypKqp0naXfeg-ANM=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F21836%2FGettyImages-461368785.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2dd4jE4","display_title":"If you use any Yahoo services, here's what to do following the massive breach","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"It isn't just your email.

By focusing on a few of its “core” areas, like email and news, the thinking went, Yahoo would be able recast its mobile business and make its long-awaited turnaround. That dream is now dead. Yahoo announced its sale to Verizon earlier this week. As part of the deal, Verizon gets Yahoo's media properties, advertising products and, yes, all the mobile apps the company once staked its future on. SEE ALSO: Yahoo has been sold. But what does this mean?So what went wrong? Well, it's complicated. Looking back at the dozens of apps launched or redesigned under Mayer's leadership, they overwhelmingly fall into two buckets: the old standbys leftover from Yahoo's days of web dominance (Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo Messenger, etc.) and the new upstarts -- many the result of Mayer's numerous acquisitions.Yahoo's new apps, were uninspired and failed to differentiate from competitors at nearly every turn.But, on both counts, almost all of those apps have proven to be complete failures. The apps representing Yahoo's legacy services turned out to be little more than the web versions, repackaged for smartphones, that many users had already abandoned long ago, or simply weren't interested in a mobile version in the first place.The new apps, meanwhile, were uninspired and failed to differentiate from competitors at nearly every turn. The result is that Yahoo had a huge portfolio of mobile apps that no one really cared about and failed to produce any meaningful innovations.That's not to say there weren't a few bright spots along the way -- Yahoo Weather being the most celebrated. Launched in 2013, the app used Flickr photography to highlight weather conditions in a design that was so beautiful it reportedly made Jony Ive jealous. It won Apple's Design Award in 2013, and Apple even borrowed elements for its redesign of the iPhone Weather app in iOS 7. Even now it's still well-reviewed and consistently ranks as one of the top weather apps in the App Store, even though it's overall position has fallen significantly (the introduction of ads in 2014 likely didn't help on this front). But a weather app -- even an excellent one -- can only do so much. Beautiful as it is, users simply don't spend that much time checking the forecast so Yahoo Weather was never going to be a significant source of engagement. And with newer apps like Dark Sky (currently the No. 1 weather app in the App Store) and Carrot Weather (No. 10), it's clear that even the weather category isn't safe from innovative upstarts taking over.The acqui-hire strategyYahoo bet big on acquisitions. Under Mayer, the company acquired dozens of promising startups with the hopes that their engineers could jumpstart Yahoo's fledgling mobile business. During an appearance at Fortune's Global Forum in November 2015, Mayer said these acquisitions resulted in \"some of the best teams we have.... We try and give them that autonomy and accountability and the resources they need to keep working on some of their missions and their ideas inside the company,\" she said. Indeed, these acquisitions (check out Gizmodo's list of all 53 of them here) brought much-needed talent to the company, but many of the new mobile products that resulted were met with little more than a collective yawn from the smartphone-carrying public.In the last year alone, Yahoo launched Yahoo Video Guide, a comprehensive guide to streaming content across dozens of services, Yahoo Esports, where you can find tournament broadcasts and news, and Radar, a travel app that provides local recommendations. The company also appears to be beta testing a Quora-like question and answer app called Hive that looks more like a reimagined version of the infamous Yahoo Answers than anything else (disclaimer: it's invite-only for now so I haven't been able to test it out myself.)It sounds like a joke: That Yahoo would create an app in 2016 -- amid an ever accelerating tailspin toward irrelevancy -- that essentially amounts to a repackaged version of Yahoo Answers is certainly laughable. But more than that, it underscores the rest of Yahoo's app failures. As its competitors were investing in the new technological frontiers of artificial intelligence or virtual reality, Yahoo hesitated. Instead, it pushed out half-baked attempts at ideas its users never wanted or simply repackaged web-based services into smartphone-sized wrappers, the waited for the ad revenue to roll in.Yahoo MailIf ever Yahoo had an opportunity to make an impact with one of its services, it was Yahoo Mail, which had hundreds of millions of users at its peak. But Yahoo was inexplicably slow to release major updates or significant new features, despite its 2013 acquisition of email startup Xobni for a reported $48 million (Xobni's founder Jeff Bonforte still oversees Yahoo Mail as the senior vice president of communications products.) Following multiple iterations (and some very big stumbles) on desktop, Yahoo rolled out its first major redesign of its Mail app under Mayer in April 2014. Well, it was sort of a redesign, anyway: It boasted a splashy new look with a few minor performance improvements. But the update didn’t bring any new features to how it actually handled email, despite the popularity of the feature-rich Mailbox and other email upstarts. By then, these apps, with customizable gestures and the ability to schedule messages to read later, had completely changed our expectations of mobile email. Yahoo Mail, on the other hand, did none of that. Instead, the update added info from Yahoo News, Weather and Finance -- effectively making Yahoo Mail more like... Yahoo's home page. It was more than a year later, in October 2015, when Yahoo redesigned the redesign and finally brought new features to the app. That version refreshed the UI (links to Yahoo News and other Yahoo properties were made less visible -- likely due to lack of use) and added new gesture-based controls that made managing emails much more similar to Mailbox, Outlook and other popular email clients. The update also added the ability to use multiple types of email accounts and a new Account Key feature that used push notifications in place of an account passwords. Account Key was the first really new idea Yahoo had tried with email, and it was a good one -- passwords are certainly in need of disruption. But by then it was far too late.Yahoo Mail continues to enjoy a large user base, but it hasn't managed to do anything truly innovative, much less keep pace with competition. Google has the AI-powered Inbox and Microsoft managed to make Outlook into one of the best email apps around, but Yahoo Mail remains little more than a punchline.By either waiting so long to deliver certain features (customizable swipes and multiple types of accounts) or ignoring them altogether (the ability to snooze emails for later), Yahoo managed to all parts of its audience: Power users expected those features years earlier while the legacy users likely didn't care about them to begin with. FlickrAn acquisition that predated Mayer, Flickr is perhaps only second to Tumblr when it comes to Yahoo properties with the most wasted potential. Once the web 2.0 darling, Yahoo all but ignored Flickr after acquiring it (check out this still excellent 2012 piece from Gizmodo detailing the many ways Yahoo screwed up the Flickr acquisition form the very beginning.) Considering it took Yahoo more than a year after the launch of the App Store to launch a dedicated app (and even longer to make one that users actually liked), it's not surprising that it was pretty easily supplanted by Instagram as the go-to destination for mobile photographers. By the time Mayer came to Yahoo, Flickr was in worse shape than ever.Needless to say, by the time Mayer came to Yahoo, Flickr was in worse shape than ever. And, to her credit, she made it a top priority early on. On the same day Yahoo announced it acquired Tumblr in May 2013, Mayer hosted a splashy event in Times Square to show off a freshly redesigned Flickr. In addition to a visual overhaul, all users would get a free terabyte of storage. It should have been great news for users -- and many did like the new look and free storage -- but many of the app's longtime paid users were disappointed with the move. While Flickr Pro users were able to keep their accounts, there was little incentive for them to do so. It didn't help that one of the only available upgrades after the relaunch was the ability to remove ads -- for twice the cost of a previous Flickr Pro account. And despite all the effort put into the relaunch, it never really was able to breathe new life into the service.When looking for Flickr's biggest missed opportunity under Mayer we can, again, look to Google. More specifically, Google Photos.Launched last year, the photo-management app quickly became one of the most popular utility apps around for its nearly unlimited storage, excellent organizational and sharing features and a powerful, intelligent search function. Flickr was certainly well-positioned to occupy a similar space. Part of Yahoo's whole rationale for the acquisition was the sheer amount of searchable user-generated image data it had. Certainly, with the right engineers and a little foresight, this could have been leveraged into a Google Photos-like experience. Some of the pieces were even there. Flickr began giving away 1TB of free storage years before Google Photos came on the scene. It even beat Google Photos to the punch (by a few weeks) in launching some intelligent search features that used image recognition.But despite its head start, Flickr's features fell behind Google Photos almost immediately. Worse, the company was never able to articulate an overarching vision for the service. TumblrThere's not much left to say about Tumblr that Mashable's Seth Fiegerman didn't already cover in his exhaustive look at all the ways Yahoo derailed Tumblr, but suffice to say that Yahoo's mishandling of the once-hot social network, combined with the rise of newer, hotter, services like Snapchat resulted in Tumblr's apps falling into near irrelevancy along with the rest of the platform.Tumblr's app, once in the top 20 apps, now hovers around the 110th position in the App Store, according to app analytics firm App Annie. Yahoo News DigestThe product of one of Mayer's splashier acquisitions, Yahoo News Digest was one of the company's early attempts at app innovation under Mayer. The app was rooted in Summly, a summarization app created by teenage developer Nick D’Aloisio. Yahoo acquired the app with much fanfare in 2013 for a reported $30 million (a sum that continues to puzzle us.) Nevertheless, Mayer then tapped the young developer to be a product manager (it was reported he committed to an 18-month stint at the company) for a new news app. The result was Yahoo News Digest, a news app that used algorithmically generated summaries -- and a team of human editors -- to provide daily \"briefings\" on the day's headlines.Though much more polished than Summly ever was, the app's only standout \"feature\" was its almost total lack of customizability. The app serves up the same handful of stories to each user, regardless of their interests. Aside from region-specific editions, there is no way to personalize what content you see. Only care about business and politics? Too bad, you'll see sports and entertainment, too.A later update added the ability to \"read extra stories\" but even this is just a standard feed based on Yahoo News' top headlines. (\"We don’t allow any customization because our promise is to deliver you the most important stories whether or not you want to to read it,\" D’Aloisio told us in 2014.)Still, the app was generally well-received -- winning Apple’s Design Award in 2014 -- and user reviews have been mostly positive. Despite this, it never once cracked the App Store’s top 100 after its first week in the store, despite a relatively good position in the App Store's News category, according to App Annie. In fact, the app's overall position is now so low it hasn't appeared in App Annie's rankings for more than a year.D’Aloisio left the company in 2015, almost exactly 18 months after joining and the app appears to have effectively died upon his departure. Yahoo News Digest remains in the App Store but hasn't gotten a single update in more than a year.Like Yahoo itself, much of the app's failure seems to be due to an identity crisis: it's not clear who the app was supposed to be for. Serious news junkies want more than a few stories a day. Yes, current versions of the app allow you to \"read extra stories,\" but the feature is so hidden it looks -- and feels -- like an afterthought rather than an intentional experience. And even those with more specific interests want something customizable that they can have a say in curating. That's not to say the core premise of the app didn't have merit. The fact that TheSkimm, a newsletter startup that breaks down the day's biggest headlines into easily digestible snippets, has flourished as much as it has is certainly a testament to that. But while TheSkimm's summaries are written to sound like your best friend explaining the news to you, Yahoo News Digest's are as dry as the newsprint they aim to supplant.LivetextIn 2015, Yahoo tried its hand at a new type of messaging app with an app called Livetext, an app for silent video chats. Users \"called\" each other, but instead of, you know, talking, they chatted via big text overlays on the video. Needless to say, the app, a pretty clear attempt at Snapchat's demographic, barely registered.The app was sort of fun, but the premise -- combining text and video but ditching the audio -- felt gimmicky and was hardly compelling enough to inspire users to ditch Snapchat or other messaging apps, if it even made it onto their radar to begin with. As with so many other Yahoo apps, it was aesthetically interesting but failed to deliver anything real users actually wanted. Instead, it overwhelmingly felt like yet another Snapchat ripoff.The app debuted in the top 150 apps in the U.S. App Store, according to App Annie, but soon declined to the 1,231 position less than two weeks later. The company axed the app earlier this year amid a bigger cost-cutting push.Yahoo MessengerWith Livetext clearly a dud, Yahoo once again tried its hand at messaging. This time, the tech giant turned to an old favorite with a redesigned version of Yahoo Messenger -- brought back to life as a mobile app in late 2015. Like so many of Yahoo's other apps, Messenger was well-designed. It handled one-on-one and group chats with ease and even leveraged Flickr (for photo sharing) and Tumblr (for a built-in GIF search) pretty nicely. It also -- like so many Yahoo apps before it -- failed to take.Though hugely dominant in the early 2000s, the fact remained that Yahoo Messenger hadn't been culturally relevant in nearly 10 years. By late 2015, the messaging universe was already incredibly mature. If Yahoo was hoping to launch a new product that could capture new users in any meaningful way, the company needed to do more than slap some Tumblr GIFs on an pretty UI. The app also lacked end-to-end encryption, which was already becoming a sought-after feature for messaging apps in 2015. Though it upgraded its security from previous versions of the app, at launch it supported TLS encryption only. \"We don't do end-to-end encryption right now; there's a tradeoff between convenience and security there, and we're evaluating that,\" the app's product manager told me at the time.Worse still, Yahoo Messenger's legacy users -- whom the company was ostensibly relying on to help prop up the app -- hated it. The app has overwhelmingly 1-star reviews in the App Store, according to App Annie. Chief among their complaints is that they were \"forced\" into using the new version of the app after the company retired the legacy mobile version of Yahoo Messenger. The Yahoo appUnlike Google, Yahoo has never made a compelling case for why anyone would want to use its self-titled mobile app, which is essentially its homepage in app form. There, you can browse the latest from Yahoo News and Finance and also search the web, though Yahoo Search is not featured prominently. Much ink has been spilled discussing Mayer's fixation on competing with Google in search. That goal may have stopped being realistic long ago (Yahoo claimed just over 12% of the US market as in February 2016, according to comScore), but surely the main Yahoo app would have been a prime place to showcase the company's search engine. Yahoo could have used the app as a place to experiment with predictive search or assistants, perhaps.Instead, the app mainly acts as a portal to read news from Yahoo's media properties: Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports and Yahoo Finance -- each of which has its own app. And, judging by App Store reviews, it's also popular among some of Yahoo's more dedicated commenters.What could have beenPundits and analysts will likely debate for a long time whether not there was anything Mayer could really have done to truly turn things around at Yahoo. But what is clear now is that, at nearly every opportunity, the company failed to define the conversation in mobile or provide any overarching vision of what their mobile business should stand for. At the same time, the company failed to identify and adapt to the bigger trends that were shaping the mobile industry. While giants like Google and Microsoft and Facebook (and the scrappy startups around them) were investing in AI, virtual reality, strong encryption and gesture-based UIs, Yahoo was still favoring aesthetics over features, clean lines over innovation. Despite its vast resources, and growing pool of engineer talent, Yahoo simply fell behind -- hoping refreshed mobile versions of its web-based services wold be enough to keep the company afloat. And while we'll never know what could have been had Mayer and Yahoo gone a different route, we know, at least, that simply being \"mobile first\" was never really enough."},"shares":{"facebook":272,"twitter":869,"google_plus":10,"linked_in":41,"pinterest":2,"total":1194},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/R46sfpZjY9Da2F5l1R0mELCHx1w=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F160064%2Fyahoo-header.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rMF3TFEKfkEOF450igKT-DqEhnc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F12441%2Fyahoo-header.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/n4-zjf3Z8MMDmYenTVS1_9utfWo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F12441%2Fyahoo-header.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yuvwyuGXDiMgXqcll1Qy_3wxre0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F12441%2Fyahoo-header.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mwR1bugFYpNYWeMp3N2sfrXT_n4=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F12441%2Fyahoo-header.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vf_Sg-jBtrQ0Sw28FpdG_8NR1yY=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F12441%2Fyahoo-header.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2a3d8T7","display_title":"Why Yahoo's big app push wasn't enough to save it","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"What went wrong with Yahoo's apps under Marissa Mayer?

The update also adds support for more types of email accounts, including Outlook.com and Hotmail.\r\n \r\nSee also: 4 super common email mistakes — and how to easily fix them\n\nAccount Key enables Yahoo's mobile users to log in to their email accounts while bypassing the password step of the process. When enabled, the app will send a push notification for users to accept in place of a password. The thinking, according to Yahoo, is that users will be able to easily shut down any unauthorized attempts to get into their account without needing to remember a complex password.\n\n\"It’s also more secure than a traditional password because once you activate Account Key -- even if someone gets access to your account info -- they can't sign in,\" the company's VP of product management, Dylan Casey, notes in a statement.\n\nThis isn't the first time Yahoo has introduced a feature to decrease users' reliance on passwords. Account Key will replace the on-demand email passwords announced earlier this year, which also allowed users to log in to their accounts without remembering their passwords. Yahoo says the feature will eventually make its way to the company's other apps as well.\n\nThe new Yahoo Mail app also sports a refreshed design that's much cleaner and easier to use than previous versions. The company simplified its gestures gestures so you can swipe to delete, mark a message as read, or long press on a message to select multiple emails at once. The app's search has also been improved so you can filter search results by photos or attachments. \n\nWith the update, Yahoo Mail now supports non-Yahoo email accounts, including Hotmail, AOL and Outlook.com on its app and website. While not as comprehensive as other mail clients like Microsoft's Outlook app, which supports Gmail, Yahoo and iCloud accounts, it will likely keep many users in the app longer. The support for multiple account types is available in the U.S only to start but the company says it will roll out to more countries soon.\r\n \r\nThe updated Yahoo Mail is available on iOS and Android."},"shares":{"twitter":831,"facebook":188,"linked_in":45,"google_plus":7,"pinterest":6,"total":1077},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SBjBaKJDlA1SHbDJkwIv8ULPoY8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F10%2F15%2Fa6%2Fyahoomail1.5bbf3.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HEf1ZyVqB38hqnDoBRPkIQKQ4Vo=/1438x0/2015%2F10%2F15%2Fa6%2Fyahoomail1.5bbf3.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/29Y3xS3Vspbkr7UMml2Fl3pS2RM=/356x205/2015%2F10%2F15%2Fa6%2Fyahoomail1.5bbf3.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YXxJlWqhQ3ntQBuSVPn_hyoOc60=/712x410/2015%2F10%2F15%2Fa6%2Fyahoomail1.5bbf3.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ywgh6P5AMlah6_eVqBB68KD7Abw=/280x157/2015%2F10%2F15%2Fa6%2Fyahoomail1.5bbf3.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pqeKowQKLUd4yOzhNzBLorlWaGE=/560x314/2015%2F10%2F15%2Fa6%2Fyahoomail1.5bbf3.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1GeemFj","display_title":"Yahoo's new email app lets you skip passwords","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/09/13/email-mistakes-fixes/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"You no longer need to enter a password when using theYahoo Mail app.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"5506fd7f12d2cd324e00f04a","id":"2015/03/16/yahoo-mail-password-sms","title":"You can now log into Yahoo Mail without remembering a password","title_tag":null,"author":"Samantha Murphy","post_date":"2015-03-16T15:57:38+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:57:38 +0000","formatted_date":"03/16/2015","formatted_shares":"2.0k","sort_key":"1yxEo4","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/03/16/yahoo-mail-password-sms/","content":{"plain":"Remembering a unique password for each online account you manage -- social networks, banking and email, to name a few -- is a headache. There are likely dozens of letter and number sequences you have to keep track of at any given time. \n\nBut Yahoo wants to help by making it easier to log into its email service. In fact, it doesn't want you to have to enter a traditional password at all. Password managers like LastPass help you remember passcodes, but Yahoo doesn't even want you to have one in the first place.\n\nSee also: 5 super easy tips for better online security on Safer Internet Day\n\nThe company introduced a new on-demand login feature that sends users a specialized code to their mobile devices to gain access. The code is generated only for that account; since it changes each time you log in, the method is secure. Hackers would have to be in physical possession of a user's smartphone to know the code and thus access the account.\n\nMany companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google have offered a similar option -- two-factor authentication -- for some time. This method is like double-locking your door at night (you need both a standard password and the messaged code to enter). Yahoo differs because you don't need a permanent password, just the one that the company sends you on demand. \n\nThe move, therefore, is technically a form of a one-factor authentication, but it signals a big move by Yahoo to eliminate passwords and also keep the service secure. Last year, the company announced that it was the target of a massive hacking that stole usernames and passwords from its email customers, so the need to provide a safe, encrypted way to keep accounts secure is greater than ever.\n\nYou can find more details on how to get an on-demand Yahoo Mail password here."},"shares":{"twitter":924,"facebook":779,"google_plus":36,"pinterest":1,"stumble_upon":281,"total":2021},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tcgis7o1AQJGludDUqCqmMl9sp0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2015%2F03%2F16%2F13%2FYahoo.60288.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jZBRd0QfZMxrq9zKQ6aviYeRfS0=/1438x0/2015%2F03%2F16%2F13%2FYahoo.60288.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HUJPJMs3yMn5RaVA6LCG29X8qNw=/356x205/2015%2F03%2F16%2F13%2FYahoo.60288.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-aTiNZMcWQ2KUzblGiFQR6ArQEA=/712x410/2015%2F03%2F16%2F13%2FYahoo.60288.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zKyWhde07a1y6N_3zVZPEFLBC1A=/280x157/2015%2F03%2F16%2F13%2FYahoo.60288.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HTOe_s3iyGs0aI95BZNOXvDyA9c=/560x314/2015%2F03%2F16%2F13%2FYahoo.60288.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1xrXWzj","display_title":"You can now log into Yahoo Mail without remembering a password","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/02/10/5-safer-internet-tips/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Yahoo is eliminating the need to have a traditional password for its Yahoo Mail service.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/"},{"_id":"546e1e2db589e46e0900735f","id":"2014/11/20/yahoo-paperless-post-emails","title":"Yahoo Mail is resurrecting one of its most requested features: E-stationery","title_tag":null,"author":"Samantha Murphy","post_date":"2014-11-20T17:00:29+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 17:00:29 +0000","formatted_date":"11/20/2014","formatted_shares":"1.6k","sort_key":"1xRvMY","link":"http://mashable.com/2014/11/20/yahoo-paperless-post-emails/","content":{"plain":"Yahoo Mail messages are about to get a sprucing up.

Each time you compose an email, you can select a new stationery template from the gallery and preview it before sending. Albers said Yahoo will eventually let users pick a default design to use each time you send an email.

The move comes a little more than six months after Yahoo redesigned the Mail app to more closely resemble its homepage, with personalized content pushed out to users, like travel and event notifications.

Designed to take advantage of high-quality mobile screens such as Apple’s Retina display, the new themes incorporate Flickr photos into Mail, giving your email experience an entirely new look. \n\nSee also: Top 25 Free iPhone Apps of All Time\n\nYahoo is currently working with the photographers of 24 different Flickr images and created customized themes around the colors in those images. \n\nYahoo tried out using Flickr photos earlier this year with the launch of Yahoo Weather, an app that displays photos in the background specific to the type of weather in your area. \n\nYahoo is taking this experience into consideration to help create the ultimate Mail experience.\n\n“This is probably one of the first releases where you’ll hear us say, ‘We learned from the mobile and we added that feature set or that design pattern over to the desktop version,” Jeff Bonforte, SVP of Communications at Yahoo told Mashable.\n\nMany users are using Yahoo Mail primarily on mobile and want some of the service's mobile features on the web version, too.\n\nThings used to be the other way around, Bonforte said -- Yahoo might try to take features that were popular on the desktop version and repackage them for mobile. Now, Yahoo is trying to take smart features from its mobile version and bring them to the desktop.\n\nThe Mail experience on the web now mimics its mobile app in many ways. Tuesday’s update will go live on desktop and mobile simultaneously.\n\nUsers can choose to take advantage of the new themes or opt for a more basic white background with back text. Your selected theme on the desktop will also be your theme on the mobile version of the app.\n\nYahoo is also making all of its premium mails features such as POP access and mail forwarding free to all users. The only paid feature for Yahoo Mail will be a $49.99/year charge for an ad-free experience.\n\nYahoo will also increase the storage space in mail, upping the total amount of storage per user to 1TB -- the same amount of space it currently offers Flickr users for free.\n\nThe new Yahoo Mail is available Tuesday for the web and iOS, Android and Windows 8 tablets. The updated look will first roll out first to English-speaking  users, but will eventually roll out worldwide.\n\nImage: Mashable, Yahoo"},"shares":{"facebook":488,"twitter":965,"linked_in":49,"google_plus":37,"pinterest":1,"total":1540},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/roYNV6stPJaXnrJ2qOn866KCv84=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2013%2F10%2F08%2Faa%2FRetinamacbo.2f0e6.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/d0xgAGaG6iqyymYrq06Qmbloc0A=/1438x0/2013%2F10%2F08%2Faa%2FRetinamacbo.2f0e6.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kIXvzqvvidkMQjUh2NNjTlVHhSU=/356x205/2013%2F10%2F08%2Faa%2FRetinamacbo.2f0e6.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oqJc-RYkU1MGN-Y07JAqRKDnyCI=/712x410/2013%2F10%2F08%2Faa%2FRetinamacbo.2f0e6.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/xM5AgCNO4hzxgDM6acR5GRv-vQU=/280x157/2013%2F10%2F08%2Faa%2FRetinamacbo.2f0e6.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TIzAlig1b33W8sabMBaDKO6k_I0=/560x314/2013%2F10%2F08%2Faa%2FRetinamacbo.2f0e6.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/19dQUEQ","display_title":"A Whole New Yahoo Mail: Flickr Themes and Storage Boost","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-slug":"best-free-iphone-apps/"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"In honor of Yahoo Mail's 16th birthday on Tuesday, the service is getting a revamp -- inspired in part by mobile.

I even bought the shirts with my own money. It wasn’t about the money, just a personal gesture on my behalf,\" he wrote.\n\nNow there will be no more T-shirts. Researchers and hackers will get rewards of at least $150, and up to $1,500 for their discoveries. The company will also give them formal recognition in the  form of an email or letter, and, in the case of really serious bugs, Yahoo will induct the researcher into a newly created \"hall of fame.\"\n\nWith this announcement, Yahoo joins scores of other companies that have so-called bug bounty programs, which have the dual goal of encouraging researchers to report bugs and foster a good relationship with independent, friendly hackers. \n\nGoogle, Microsoft, and Facebook already have programs, although Facebook had its own PR misstep when it refused to reward a Palestinian hacker who broke into Mark Zuckerberg's timeline. The hacker eventually got rewarded with more than $11,000 by a crowdsourced campaign.\n\nWhat's more, Martinez announced that the program is retroactive and researchers who reported bugs after July 1, 2013, will get rewarded too. That includes Ilia Kolochenko, who found three serious vulnerabilities in Yahoo mail on Sept. 23, and was then offered a gift voucher of $25.\n\nKolochenko, who is the CEO of security firm High Tech Bridge, told Mashable that Yahoo still hasn't contacted him for a reward, but he's glad it is changing its policies. And he said he was surprised to find out Martinez paid rewards with his own money.\n\n\"Such action definitely deserves big respect, but does he get his salary by Yahoo gift-vouchers as well?\" he wrote in an email. \"I have a feeling that Yahoo's top management, who didn't provide their security team with enough funding before our post, now tries to put the blame on the CSO and his team, who reacted rapidly and made good changes to their reward policy. That's not very fair.\"\n\nUPDATE, Oct. 3, 3:04 p.m.:  In the event of receiving a monetary award, Ilia Kolochenko said High Tech Bridge will donate it to the non-profit security Open Security Foundation.\n\nImage: Flickr, carvalho"},"shares":{"twitter":418,"facebook":64,"linked_in":19,"google_plus":9,"total":510},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gdbPOg9evZyrZkh5dRowZgJah8M=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2013%2F10%2F03%2F95%2Fyahoolaunch.40ca8.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dI7IT-Hxeh6_CxcndgwvnQ_2LqI=/1438x0/2013%2F10%2F03%2F95%2Fyahoolaunch.40ca8.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/A3O7KvNZ9r-ulXfEn0I9pUuW0FI=/356x205/2013%2F10%2F03%2F95%2Fyahoolaunch.40ca8.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/F6eyx-RbAuJHjuP4mA9Q6aG4LdM=/712x410/2013%2F10%2F03%2F95%2Fyahoolaunch.40ca8.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eMwuYX5acwkJZBa2UfiQ5yH_ls0=/280x157/2013%2F10%2F03%2F95%2Fyahoolaunch.40ca8.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3wL65neuPThjZMVDOfBBDgBOD0w=/560x314/2013%2F10%2F03%2F95%2Fyahoolaunch.40ca8.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1f36oiV","display_title":"Yahoo Finally Launches Bug Bounty Program to Reward Hackers","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/08/02/samsung-smart-tv-hack/"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"After offering one hacker a grand total of $25 dollars to buy Yahoo-themed swag (such as T-shirts, \"poopy bag dispensers,\" or purple rubber ducks), Yahoo is getting serious at rewarding friendly hackers, announcing a program that will offer rewards o...","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/"},{"_id":"524b219a97b2f82e6a003c70","id":"2013/10/01/yahoo-bug-bounty-25-dollar-voucher","title":"Yahoo Offers $25 Voucher to Researcher Who Uncovered Serious Bug","title_tag":null,"author":"Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai","post_date":"2013-10-01T19:25:05+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 01 Oct 2013 19:25:05 +0000","formatted_date":"10/01/2013","formatted_shares":"731","sort_key":"1vr5zb","link":"http://mashable.com/2013/10/01/yahoo-bug-bounty-25-dollar-voucher/","content":{"plain":"If you are a skilled security researcher and you uncover and report a Microsoft bug or vulnerability, you might get up to $100,000. With Facebook, you might get $12,500, and with Google, the reward could be $20,000. \n\nAnd Yahoo? In Yahoo's case, you get a $25 voucher that can only be used to buy company swag, like a T-Shirt, a few light-up ice cubes, or some \"poopy bag dispensers\" -- though some of these don't even sport the new Yahoo logo.\n\nSee also: Video Explains How to Hack Apple's Fingerprint Scanner\n\nThat's the paltry reward that Yahoo offered to a Swiss security researcher who uncovered and responsibly reported three serious vulnerabilities on Sept. 23. \n\n\"Initially I thought it was a joke,\" Ilia Kolochenko, the CEO of security firm High Tech Bridge, told Mashable.\n\nIf exploited by malicious hackers, the bugs could potentially allow them to take over any Yahoo email account by tricking a logged-in user into clicking a specially crafted link, according to a blog post published by High Tech Bridge, the security firm who found the bugs. \n\nIn recent years, so-called bug bounty programs have become very popular among Silicon Valley companies. In essence, these programs aim to reward responsible security researchers or hackers who find bugs in products or software and report them to the affected companies, which in turn reward them. Google, Facebook, and Microsoft all have such programs. Yahoo doesn't, although it encourages researchers to report vulnerabilities. \n\n\"If you are a member of the security community and need to report a technical vulnerability, contact: security@yahoo-inc.com,\" the Yahoo security policies state. \n\nWith that in mind, Kolochenko set out to find out more about how exactly Yahoo deals with these kind of reports.\n\n\"The goal of the experiment was very simple: to find out how quickly security vulnerabilities on well-known websites such as Yahoo can be found and to see how the company reacts to a vulnerability notification,\" the firm wrote in its blog post.\n\nKolochenko started working on this experiment on Sept. 18, and, by accident, he quickly found one bug and reported it. But the Yahoo security team responded that the vulnerability had already been flagged. \n\nThen, on Sept. 22, while stuck in an airport lounge for six hours, he found three serious cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities affecting the domains ecom.yahoo.com and adserver.yahoo.com. These bugs could have been used to hack into Yahoo email accounts, according to Kolochenko.\n\nWhen he reported them, Yahoo acknowledged two of the three bugs and thanked him, offering a $25 (or $12.50 per bug) discount voucher to be used on the Yahoo Company Store.\n\nWhile Kolochenko said he \"was not doing the research for money,\" he found the amounts \"quite surprising.\" \n\n\"I didn't complain,\" he told Mashable via email. \"[I] just asked them if they have a 'Honor Roll' and if they really pay these amounts.\"\n\nFacebook, in comparison, recently paid $12,500 to a hacker who found a bug that allowed him to delete any user's pictures (it must be noted, though, that the social network also recently failed to reward another hacker who broke into Mark Zuckerberg's Timeline.)\n\nKolochenko decided to \"hold off on further research,\" and needless to say, he was ultimately disappointed.\n\n\"Yahoo should probably revise their relations with security researchers,\" Kolochenko, High Tech Bridge's CEO, was quoted as saying in the blog post. \"Paying several dollars per vulnerability is a bad joke and won’t motivate people to report security vulnerabilities to them, especially when such vulnerabilities can be easily sold on the black market for a much higher price.\"\n\nGraham Cluley, a security expert and blogger, also criticized Yahoo in a blog post.\n\n\"Of course, money (and t-shirts) shouldn’t be the only motivation for reporting a security vulnerability,\" he wrote. \"But such a risible reward is unlikely to win Yahoo any friends and could -- if anything -- make it less likely that the site will gain the assistance of white-hats in future.\"\n\nYahoo hasn't responded to Mashable's requests for comment, but High Tech Bridge reports that the bugs were all patched by Yahoo when the security firm disclosed the incident in its blog post. \n\nAsked if he would redeem the $25 voucher -- which could he could use to buy a Yahoo volleyball, a purple rubber duck, or, perhaps Yahoo's gourmet jelly beans -- Kolochenko simply responded: \"No.\"\r\n \r\nImage: Flickr, Tamar Winberg"},"shares":{"twitter":437,"facebook":229,"google_plus":40,"linked_in":25,"total":731},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KgE3kVlvqUubtTFeILNl8tCkKk0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2013%2F10%2F01%2F65%2Fyahoooffers.34d93.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hk8OUY2TeSgjSGHHcMg0IGD9GEU=/1438x0/2013%2F10%2F01%2F65%2Fyahoooffers.34d93.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/N9xgQVFIa2dDKPN4QAFAUbYUttQ=/356x205/2013%2F10%2F01%2F65%2Fyahoooffers.34d93.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_JZaZMjpEeR8gl1QEvsYKmVAYhE=/712x410/2013%2F10%2F01%2F65%2Fyahoooffers.34d93.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lWcKHhItr1xvJpz3CSQr-o3svIc=/280x157/2013%2F10%2F01%2F65%2Fyahoooffers.34d93.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Sg-meLsVKjFwj0uE9chJOnWBV4U=/560x314/2013%2F10%2F01%2F65%2Fyahoooffers.34d93.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/15J9PTK","display_title":"Yahoo Offers $25 Voucher to Researcher Who Uncovered Serious Bug","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/09/25/video-hack-apple-touch-id/"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"If you are a skilled security researcher and you uncover and report a Microsoft bug or vulnerability, you might get up to $100,000.

The app has the same standard layout, with a column on the left side of the screen displaying your inbox, and a larger square on the right that displays each message.\n\nYahoo stands out from the competition, however, with a special full screen function for reading mail. Activated by a small arrow button on the bottom of the screen, full screen mode allows you to flip through your inbox like you’re reading a book, complete with page-turn animations. If you’re in a hurry, you can also tap on the right side of the screen to flip through messages at a faster pace. Attached images are brought into the message inline.\n\nThe whole experience feels more like Flipboard than mail, making it not only easier to read content, but a more pleasant and immersive experience as well.\n\nGetting Organized\r\nOrganization also plays a key role in the app. When a check mark is placed to the left of a message in your inbox, that image is displayed in the larger area to the right where an email message is traditionally displayed. Swipe to the right on that message and you’ll be given a number of actions that can be completed on that message such as starring it, moving it to a folder, or deleting it entirely.\n\nNot really a standout feature for a single message, if you highlight a group of messages -- or your entire inbox -- Yahoo will gather together all of the emails by the same sender and let you perform bulk actions on those messages. For instance, my Yahoo inbox was cluttered with old messages from places like Groupon, Travelocity, and newsletters from Yahoo Groups I joined a decade ago. By selecting my entire inbox I was able to delete all of those messages at once and remove the clutter.\n\nThe idea behind the feature is that you might take care of some messages in bulk when you start a mail session, and then kick back and read through the email that you do want to see full screen.\n\nSimple in design, Yahoo hopes that the tablet app will delight current Yahoo Mail users, and perhaps encourage a few people who might be dabbling with other mail services to give Yahoo another try.\n\nYahoo Mail for tablets is available now for iPad and Android tablets, including the Kindle Fire.\n\nWhat do you think of the app?

And we've listened. Starting today, the new Yahoo Mail is fast, easy and available anywhere you go. These improvements will be available on all major platforms: Web, Windows 8, iPhone/iPod touch and Android.\"\n\nMayer said most mail users will start to see the latest web version of Yahoo Mail in the next few days. \n\nThe news doesn't come as a complete surprise. Yahoo's major web-mail competitors -- Microsoft and Google -- have both revamped their products in 2012, and many suspected Mayer sought to improve Yahoo Mail since leaving Google for Yahoo in July.\n\nThe web-based version touts a design with fewer buttons crowding the screen, search improvements and thumbnail previews of attachments that appear at the top of the messages. There's also more space to view and compose emails. \n\n\"We’ve redesigned the new version of Yahoo Mail with speed in mind -- getting through your emails is faster than ever before,\" she added. \"We’ve also made your inbox more intuitive and easier to navigate, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your messages. And, because mobile is everything these days, Yahoo Mail now has a consistent look and feel across devices.\"\n\nYahoo Mail for iPhone will also include new features, such as the ability to select multiple messages and swipe to quickly delete, star, file or mark it as read. Infinite message scroll is also available, as well as the ability to attach pictures while composing a message.\n\nMeanwhile, the Android app has been redesigned \"for performance and battery life,\" according to the company, and Windows 8 users can now see messages from the start screen to stay on top of everything.\n\nImage courtesy of iStockphoto, Alija"},"shares":{"twitter":672,"linked_in":37,"google_plus":22,"facebook":60,"pinterest":1,"stumble_upon":1248,"total":2040},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UKj51TNecPms3RZLf5XCumoueM0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2012%2F12%2F11%2F13%2FYahoo.eCu.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3tBiBH2EPdRVKcH2fznfHz5gtmc=/1438x0/2012%2F12%2F11%2F13%2FYahoo.eCu.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wAI-8rKmEAFh1aogliGJ1Fam6E4=/356x205/2012%2F12%2F11%2F13%2FYahoo.eCu.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-5WLMQ2jE7MW0urH5fhBBkqgN8Q=/712x410/2012%2F12%2F11%2F13%2FYahoo.eCu.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GXhrNDgHdnetzdI1lRD0JTHI8JU=/280x157/2012%2F12%2F11%2F13%2FYahoo.eCu.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Pp6lMJLgUWoFU4Dh16SOnwPvrJg=/560x314/2012%2F12%2F11%2F13%2FYahoo.eCu.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/SOatKS","display_title":"Yahoo Mail Gets Major Overhaul With Emphasis on Fewer Distractions","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"It's been a long time coming, but Yahoo!

Each post highlights a unique feature of a startup. If you'd like your startup considered for inclusion, please see the details  here.\n\nName: PhilterIt\n\nQuick Pitch: PhilterIt is a web platform that turns large email streams into visual mail feeds -- complete with brand icons and profile pictures. \n\nGenius Idea: PhilterIt separates personal messages and brand emails. The customizable dashboard also lets users prioritize emails from different users and brands, so they're never overlooked. \n\nEmail is more pervasive than ever. For one, it's hard to leave work-related emails at the office. Most of us check our email every one to two hours in our free time. Nearly 98% of people send work-related emails at night and on weekends. \n\nThe problem: our inboxes are time-consuming beasts. PhilterIt is a new web platform that promises to tame email with the help of filters. PhilterIt gives you the choice to prioritize emails or hide them by sender. \n\nThe interface pulls all emails received in the last 30 days. PhilterIt supports Gmail, Yahoo Mail and AOL Mail. Sign-up is a simple three-step process -- enter an email, email password and invitation code. PhilterIt is still in a \"public beta.\" The first 500 Mashable readers can sign up with invitation code Mashable. \n\nUpon registration, PhilterIt lists all the brands that have sent you emails, in categories including Entertainment, Finance & Bills, Organizations and Retail. Users can click on the brands to mark those emails as high priority. From then on, these emails will be accessible on your personal Dashboard. \n\nIn the company's mail feed, personal messages are separated from brand messages. Users can also choose to view all, read or unread emails. It's all about choice. Users can delete emails, compose messages and read from within the interface. \n\nCo-founders Avi Levine and Robert Wollner started PhilterIt to tackle the \"basic pains of email.\"\n\n\"The idea was we get so many messages into our accounts and our accounts are only built to deal with them one at a time with our most recent one on top,\" Levine tells Mashable. \"You don't need to have every message at your fingertips when they come in. There are messages you care about more than others.\"\n\nIndividuals generally want to see personal messages from friends and family immediately, he says. Brand emails can wait.\n\nSEE ALSO: Gmail for iPhone App Update May Annoy You\n\nPhilterIt is a product of research, surveys and one-on-one interviews to find out what individuals want from their inboxes. \n\nPhilterIt can be as dynamic or as simple as users want. The startup hopes to revolutionize email and online communication. The young company, which started development in November, is still open to user feedback and the team works to perfect the product. The next step is to optimize the web platform for mobile use. \n\nVarious startups are developing different product solutions to fix the current state of email. AwayFind is a product that forwards emails from specified senders or emails containing specific words to user phones via text and tweet. Other products such as Unroll.me allow you to unsubscribe from all the mailing lists you signed up for. The co-founders found out individuals would rather save brand emails when they needed them rather than deleting them just to get to the important personal messages.\n\nIt's a distinguishing trait of the product. PhilterIt prioritizes messages from people and lets you see brand messages later. \n\n\"Our major goal is to give people a new way to organize, manage and interact with their inbox,\" Levine said. \"It's making email less stressful for the user. We want to build the inbox of the future -- we shouldn't be restricted.\"\n\nHow many times on average do you check your email each day?

On Tuesday, BrandMyMail is launching a Premium version that extends its tool to users of Hotmail, Yahoo Mail and Outlook. Besides the extra email services, Premium users also get to have more than one template, plus some bonus modules they can include in templates, like eBay and LinkedIn.\n\nSEE ALSO: 6 Smart & Effective Email Marketing Tactics\n\nFinally, Premium also brings the good stuff: analytics tools, which will count the total emails sent, open rates and clicks. The tool can even tell which of your modules in your template are getting clicked on the most. There's also an web service API that'll integrate BrandMyMail with standard enterprise software.\n\nHow premium are we talking about? The paid service costs $39 a year.

Those receipts pack meaningful data and Slice seeks to put that information at users' fingertips. \n\nBecause it's embedded within the new Yahoo Mail experience, the All My Purchases application helps users extract the commerce data housed inside of their inboxes. The app highlights open orders and shipments, as well as last received purchases under the \"Home\" tab. The user can dive into the \"Track Shipments\" tab to check out his purchases in transit or browse within the \"Purchase History\" tab to view and filter all of his previous online orders.\n\nThe startup extracts important data pieces such as item order numbers, customer service phone numbers and retailer return policies -- via extraction algorithms that took more than a year to build -- and presents the information in an easy-to-find fashion. \n\nAnd Slice isn't only interested in online purchases. The startup is tracking the rise of electronic receipts issued by brick-and-mortar stores and will work to extract purchase data from these receipts as well. As more of these retailers adopt ereceipts, Slice will grow in utility, offering users a single place to reference all of their past purchases.\n\nThe startup is currently focused on supporting its Yahoo Mail application and the thousands of new users that are just now being introduced to the product through Yahoo. It also makes a Gmail purchase extraction tool, however, currently in limited release. \n\nEventually Slice will support all web-based email clients in the same way.

Yahoo says that many of its core features have been \"re-architeched\" in an effort to make downloading and e-mailing a faster experience.  The interface itself is reminiscent of the Gmail interface.\n\nYahoo has also made its e-mail client more social. Like Gmail or Hotmail, if someone sends you a link from Flickr or YouTube, those photos or videos will automatically be embedded in the e-mail.  Flickr (a Yahoo property) also includes a new slideshow feature.\n\nFacebook and Twitter are the big social additions to Yahoo Mail, though.  As part of its strategy to integrate social media into its products, Yahoo is giving its mail users the ability to update their statuses on Facebook and Twitter.  The \"What's New\" tab also lets you see your friends' updates from Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft have been upping the ante recently with updates to their webmail products, so Yahoo's move shouldn't surprise anybody.  Microsoft recently reinvented Hotmail, bringing a faster interface, integration with Office Web Apps and a new \"Sweep\" function.

We presume these will include maps, e-mail and chat, although it isn't clear if the Ovi login will extend to other Yahoo services like Flickr.\n\nStrategically, this makes a lot of sense. Although Nokia is the largest mobile device maker in the world, its marketshare -- especially in next-generation smartphones -- lags behind companies like Google, Apple and RIM. Likewise, while Yahoo still has a significant share of the online mail market, its services are in decline and its search deal with Microsoft won't be complete on a global scale until 2012.\n\nSince Nokia already has strong investments in mapping and navigation, and Yahoo has a handle on chat and e-mail, it makes sense for the two companies to partner together instead of trying to build out their own services.\n\nWhat do you think of this arrangement?\n\nFor more mobile coverage, follow Mashable Mobile on Twitter or become a fan on Facebook"},"shares":{"google_buzz":56,"facebook":49,"total":105},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8QRARo_aEfm4IF5q0yN4cxAowG8=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fe2%2Fyahooandnok.aFI.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/a2M_YMJQP_7QzzMsycgCcsk9ldM=/1438x0/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fe2%2Fyahooandnok.aFI.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/tcO8FFhDzU4UvVm8XVSc_NY0DEw=/356x205/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fe2%2Fyahooandnok.aFI.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fxn3tlj5mfcE549VL4FTnLkDAIQ=/712x410/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fe2%2Fyahooandnok.aFI.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zjPxSntQr3utSqCUbXj050rrgWU=/280x157/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fe2%2Fyahooandnok.aFI.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Gjb0XXaPF3q_Gad8FazD244b6nE=/560x314/2012%2F12%2F04%2Fe2%2Fyahooandnok.aFI.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://mashable.com/2010/05/24/nokia-yahoo-deal/","display_title":"Yahoo and Nokia Join Forces for E-mail and Maps","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Nokia and Yahoo announced a partnership today that will meld the companies' e-mail, chat and mapping services across their respective platforms.

Will a Yahoo Mail user open and read as much email as the average Gmail user?  This is the type of data that can be essential for both researchers and marketers.\n\neMarketer picked up on some recent numbers released by MailChimp that indicate that, in fact, Gmail users are more likely to open emails and click on links within them when compared to the other mail email clients.\n\nThe following is a graph of email engagement, based on MailChimp's analysis of over 184 million emails:\n\nWhile Hotmail, Yahoo, and AOL mail users are very similar in terms of the amount of email they read (the low 20% range) and how often they click on links (between 4.2% and 4.5%), Gmail users open emails at a 30.9% rate. They also click on links 6.4% of the time.\n\nAs eMarketer points out, Gmail also produces the lowest bounce rate of all email services, although that probably has more to do with Gmail's spam protection than any other factor.  As for why Gmail users are more engaged with email, the answer may be about Gmails more tech-savvy demographic, or it could be that the Gmail interface is more friendly to opening emails.  It's tough to stay.\n\nGmail's still a smaller player in the scheme of things, though.   Yahoo Mail still dominates with about 106 million visitors, as compared to Gmail's 36.9 million uniques, just over 1/3 of Yahoo's traffic.  As Gmail continues to grow, these engagement numbers may change.

It doesn't stop there though - it's a well thought out application that offers a lot more. \n\nAffixa is a desktop application; after installation, it will ask to become your default e-mail client, which is basically required for it to work. Its main feature is taking over \"mailto\" links and adding the possibility to send stuff directly to your webmail accounts, such as Gmail and Yahoo Mail. It also has the option of automatically employing drop.io for sending large files; automatic shrinking of attachments (for example, you can set all images you send to be shrunk to several predefined sizes), and you can even set advanced rules for certain attachments, if you think they might cause problems for certain recepients. \n\nWhether you're going to like Affixa or not depends a lot on your e-mailing habits. I, for example, am so used to merely opening Gmail and doing everything e-mail related from there, that most of Affixa's features seem superfluous. \n\nIf your job requires you to spend several hours checking and sending e-mails, and you're looking to make better use of that time, you should definitely check what Affixa has to offer. \n\nAdditional Resources from Mashable\n\n- 7 Ways to Send HUGE Files: 25X Bigger than Gmail\n\n- 20+ Tools to Make Any Email Inbox More Social\n\n- 75+ Email Services That Aren’t Gmail"},"shares":{"facebook":3,"total":3},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dXA8of6x8w0vOS2R2y5YyUTLorI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2012%2F12%2F04%2F9f%2Faffixabring.aG4.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Y0IxjZ5Dz-cW1G3SZNxH8cADXzE=/1438x0/2012%2F12%2F04%2F9f%2Faffixabring.aG4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Sh7_zH63cgYskVBYuc1mv3vdkhc=/356x205/2012%2F12%2F04%2F9f%2Faffixabring.aG4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DqdtwNl4udfTUqploLV69DZcmgk=/712x410/2012%2F12%2F04%2F9f%2Faffixabring.aG4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-LN0PD1OIcMcbT0RqO2wwIFyxQ8=/280x157/2012%2F12%2F04%2F9f%2Faffixabring.aG4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5qPQXuBsa59iz60JViwyIPotSg4=/560x314/2012%2F12%2F04%2F9f%2Faffixabring.aG4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://mashable.com/2009/02/02/affixa-webmail/","display_title":"Affixa Brings Webmail to Your Desktop","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Affixa is, at its core, an e-mail management application.
