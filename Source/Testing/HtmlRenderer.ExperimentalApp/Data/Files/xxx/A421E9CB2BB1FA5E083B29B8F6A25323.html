		<h1 class='section-title landing'>Sexual Content Warning</h1>

		<p>This website contains information, links, images and videos of sexually explicit material.
		If you are under the age of 18, if such material offends you or if it's illegal to view such
		material in your community please do not continue. Please read and comply with the following
		conditions before you continue: </p>

		<p>I am at least 18 years of age (21 in some areas). The sexually explicit material I am viewing
		is for my own personal use and I will not expose minors to the material. I desire to receive/view
		sexually explicit material. I believe that as an adult it is my inalienable right to receive/view
		sexually explicit material. I believe that sexual acts between consenting adults are neither
		offensive nor obscene.</p>

		<p>The viewing, reading and downloading of sexually explicit materials does not violate the
		standards of my community, town, city, state or country. I am solely responsible for any false
		disclosures or legal ramifications of viewing, reading or downloading any material in this site.
		Furthermore this website nor its affiliates will be held responsible for any legal ramifications
		arising from fraudulent entry into or use of this website.</p>

		<p>This warning page constitutes a legal agreement between this website and you and/or any business
		in which you have any legal or equitable interest. If any portion of this agreement is deemed
		unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction it shall not affect the enforceability of the
		other portions of the agreement. All performers on this site are over the age of 18, have consented
		being photographed and/or filmed, have signed model release and provided proof of age, believe it is
		their right to engage in consensual sexual acts for the entertainment and education of other adults
		and believe it is your right as an adult to watch them doing what adults do. The videos and images
		in this site are intended to be used by responsible adults as sexual aids, to provide sexual education
		and to provide sexual entertainment. All activity is arranged and discussed in advance of filming and
		every effort is made to insure the health and safety of the performers and to ensure that their
		performance is a pleasant and enjoyable experience.</p>

		<p>So, without too much further ado, if you've read and fully understand the above agreement, and you
		affirm and swear that viewing/downloading/receiving sexually explicit materials does not violate the
		standards of your community, that you won't make any of the materials available to minors in any form,
		that you believe it is your constitutional right to view these materials, that you are wholly liable for
		any legal ramifications that may arise for your receiving or viewing of these materials and that you are
		over the age of 18, click the enter button at the top of the page.</p>
