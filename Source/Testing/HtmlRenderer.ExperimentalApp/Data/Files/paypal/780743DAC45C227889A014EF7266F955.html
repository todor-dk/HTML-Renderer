digital wallet, but business owners must consider its merits as a merchant services and payment solutions provider. We’ll touch on the consumer experience a little bit in this review, but mostly we want to help business owners evaluate PayPal’s credit card processing services.</p><p>Accepting PayPal is a no-brainer. Almost everyone has a PayPal account these days (in fact, PayPal claims <a href="https://www.paypal-media.com/about">192 million active users in more than 200 markets</a>), it&#8217;s incredibly easy to setup and use, and it can get you up and running in a very short amount of time (i.e, immediately).</p><p>PayPal is extremely transparent with its terms and pricing, and it doesn&#8217;t lock you into a contract with an <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/merchant-account-early-cancellation-fee/">early termination fee</a>. The number of integrations offered is unreal, so you can be certain that PayPal will sync with your <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/shopping-cart-comparison/">shopping cart</a>, accounting application, or shipping software. PayPal even offers an mPOS app (PayPal Here) for mobile merchants (you can <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-here-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check out our full review of that here</a>). The company also owns <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/braintree-payment-solutions-review/">Braintree Payments</a>, but the user experience is very different if you sign up with Braintree.</p><p>But the question remains: Should PayPal be your primary payment processing platform, or should you just use it peripherally to allow customers to pay with their PayPal accounts for their convenience?</p><p>PayPal is not without its downsides. The service is quick to <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/avoid-merchant-account-holds-freezes-terminations/">hold sellers&#8217; funds</a> or even freeze and shut down accounts if the company suspects fraud. It seems to be trigger happy when it comes risk-related issues, which is par for the course with any sort of payment aggregator. We&#8217;ve read numerous reviews from frustrated sellers whose lifeblood (cash) has been tied up in PayPal&#8217;s risk department. A good way to avoid relying completely on PayPal is to get a traditional merchant account as well. You can offer PayPal as a secondary payment option, so just in case you do have to deal with the aforementioned issues, you won&#8217;t be completely cut off from your funds.</p><p>Another issue seems to be with PayPal&#8217;s phone support. Sometimes it&#8217;s great, sometimes it&#8217;s awful. That&#8217;s to be expected from such a large company, but it’s certainly not ideal. And while PayPal is consistent and transparent as far as payments go, it isn&#8217;t the cheapest option available (see &#8220;Fees and Rates&#8221;). If you&#8217;re looking to get low rates, then you should opt for a <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-comparison-chart/">regular merchant account</a>.</p><p>Finally, while PayPal does have a pay-as-you-go setup that works very well for most merchants, if you want a few advanced features (namely a virtual terminal, hosted payment page, or recurring billing), they are going to cost you additional monthly fees.</p><p>We&#8217;ve been saying that every merchant should accept PayPal, but not every merchant should rely on PayPal exclusively, for a long time. That&#8217;s still true. PayPal is ubiquitous and adding PayPal to your site can help you make more sales (or so <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayPal claims on its site</a>). At the same time, there is always an inherent risk of your account being frozen or shut down with an aggregator, and it&#8217;s something you just have to accept. You can reduce your risk by reading up on the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full?locale.x=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms of service</a> and make sure your business falls within the prescribed guidelines.</p><p>But also consider that PayPal&#8217;s stability is on par with most other pay-as-you-go payment aggregators. That includes <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/square-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Square</a> and <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/stripe-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe</a>, both of which have similar, but not identical, offerings.</p><p>PayPal is absolutely set up in a way that will grow with your business from day one until you make it to the big leagues &#8212; and PayPal&#8217;s roster of clients proves that. But at a certain point, you&#8217;re probably going to find it more beneficial to switch over to a merchant account so you can start benefiting from interchange-plus and more reliable customer service.</p><p>If you need more advanced options and you’re processing a larger volume, take a look at <strong><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/payjunction-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PayJunction</a> or one of our <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-comparison-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other top-rated merchant accounts</a></strong>. If you only process sporadically, you are just starting out, or you have trouble opening a merchant account for another reason that ISN&#8217;T &#8220;high-risk business,&#8221; ask yourself whether PayPal has all the features you need. If the answer is yes, go for it.</p><p>We&#8217;re giving PayPal <strong>4 stars</strong> for its ease of use, clear pricing, and transparent advertising. If its customer service can solve the consistency issue and we see improvements in account stability, we&#8217;ll consider bumping up that rating &#8212; but not until then. Read the full review for all the nitty-gritty on PayPal’s merchant solutions, or head over to <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-comparison-chart/">our comparison chart</a> to see some of our favorite merchant account providers!</p><h2>Products &amp; Services:</h2><p>Most people think of PayPal mostly as a P2P payment app or the default payment method for eBay. But PayPal offers a lot of different features and capabilities, and it&#8217;s expanding and diversifying a lot now that it&#8217;s a publicly traded company in its own right. I&#8217;m honestly excited to see what PayPal is going to do next because the company seems to genuinely get what merchants need, and it keeps up on changing trends.</p><p>The company breaks down its processing options into three categories:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/express-checkout">PayPal Express Checkout</a></li><li>PayPal Payments Standard</li><li>PayPal Payments Pro</li></ul><p>PayPal Express Checkout is a simple add-on for businesses that already accept credit cards and just want to let consumers pay with PayPal as an alternative. It&#8217;s very low investment and easy to implement. You&#8217;ll pay the same rates as the other PayPal options.</p><p>Standard is a basic payment processing plan for merchants who don&#8217;t already have a way to accept payments on their website. It&#8217;s just a percentage plus a flat fee per transaction, with no monthly subscription. Customers are routed to PayPal&#8217;s site to enter their payment information before finishing the transaction.</p><p>With the Pro version, you can handle the entire checkout process on your site, with no need to redirect to PayPal&#8217;s site. For some business owners, that hosted payment page could be a huge plus. There are other perks you get with the Pro plan as well.</p><p>You can go <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/compare-business-products">here</a> to compare the payment solutions in more detail.</p><p>Additional services offered by PayPal are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/credit-card-reader">PayPal Here</a>: This is PayPal&#8217;s mobile payments app. Check out <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-here-review/">our review here</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/payflow-payment-gateway">Payflow Payment Gateway</a>: If you already have a merchant account but need a payment gateway, then you can use PayPal&#8217;s stand-alone Payflow Gateway. The gateway supports nearly every major processor and a whole host of other applications including <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/shopping-cart-comparison/">shopping carts</a>, accounting &amp; billing software, shipping &amp; labeling software, etc. It also charges just a flat fee per transaction, not a monthly subscription.</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/virtual-terminal">Virtual Terminal</a>: If you need to process mail/phone orders, then you can do so through PayPal&#8217;s virtual terminal. It&#8217;s $30/month on its own, or included for free in the Pro plan (which is also $30/month).</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/online-invoicing">Online Invoicing</a>: Consultants and contractors can use PayPal&#8217;s invoicing features to invoice their clients for the same rate as regular web transactions.</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/bill-me-later-nav">Bill Me Later</a>: This credit offering gives you the ability to offer no-interest financing to your customers.</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/pro-recurring-payments" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recurring Billing</a>: If you offer a subscription-based service, you can set up monthly payments for your customers. You&#8217;ll have to add this feature to your Pro Plan for Virtual Terminal subscription for an additional fee.</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/get-started/payment-authorization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-auth</a>: You can capture the funds on a customer&#8217;s card and charge them later. This is great for appointment-setting and other services that require reservations. 100% of the funds are guaranteed for only 3 days, but you can run a pre-auth up to 30 days in advance.</li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/digital-goods">Digital Goods</a>: If you&#8217;re in the business of selling digital goods or content, you can accept micropayments, subscription payments, and pay-as-you-go payments.</li></ul><p>PayPal also offers a &#8220;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/stories/us/paypal-expands-one-touch-to-143-markets-18m-consumers-optin">One Touch</a>&#8221; feature. Originally launched as a mobile feature so that smartphone users did not have to continually sign into PayPal to make purchases on their phones, it&#8217;s now available for websites as well. One Touch allows users to skip entering payment and shipping details, which means one less step for your customers. And having a convenient checkout process is a huge deal for businesses since it can decrease shopping cart abandonment.</p><p>Check out the promo video here:</p><div class="fve-video-wrapper fve-image-embed fve-thumbnail-image youtube" style="padding-bottom:56.25%;"> <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qnDLl1MtU3w?wmode=transparent&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;autohide=1&#038;showinfo=0&#038;rel=0" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p>PayPal says that eligible merchants will have this feature automatically enabled and available to customers, so if you haven&#8217;t looked at the front end of your site in a while, you might want to take a peek.</p><p>PayPal also has its very own <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/debit-card">debit card for businesses</a>. The card gives you fast access to cash from your PayPal account — no reason to wait for an ACH transfer. Instead, you can withdraw money from any ATM with a MasterCard, Maestro, or Cirrus acceptance mark. It also makes accounting simpler because you don&#8217;t have to use your personal accounts to make business purchases or constantly shuffle funds around.</p><p><strong>What&#8217;s New</strong></p><p>We&#8217;ve already seen some really interesting choices in PayPal&#8217;s business decisions: In addition to acquiring Braintree back in 2013, PayPal bought Venmo, a peer-to-peer cash transfer app that PayPal is in the process of monetizing. It also acquired another company, a commerce-oriented startup called Modest, in August of 2015.</p><p>The acquisition of Modest is how PayPal is driving <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/commerce">PayPal Commerce</a>. The goal is &#8220;contextual commerce,&#8221; with a goal of providing truly turnkey service to merchants who want to be able to sell on any platform. Right now, the SDK allows you to create an entire mobile store within an app, and to embed &#8220;buy&#8221; buttons in email and blog posts. We noted that Commerce was new when we did our last review update in March 2016 &#8212; and I&#8217;m a bit sad to say it&#8217;s still in beta. This is a feature that I really want to see do well and be available to everyone.</p><p>Other additions include:</p><p><strong>Contactless Payments:</strong> Back in February, word broke that PayPal would also be enabling NFC payments in its consumer-facing app. There still isn&#8217;t a lot of information about this &#8212; the most recent updates are from July, but if you log into your consumer PayPal app (not PayPal Here) and enable location services, you can search for local stores that accept PayPal. This should surprise absolutely no one since Apple, Android, and Samsung all have their own apps to do this and I am sure there are others in the works.</p><p><strong>Mass Payment:</strong> PayPal has also added a mass payment feature. This is really awesome to see. It&#8217;s not the marketplace solutions that you&#8217;ll see from Braintree or Stripe, but it does mean that if you just want to be able to pay a lot of people with ease, you can do that. And, PayPal will give you a better rate &#8212; 2%, capped at $1 per transaction. That makes it more attractive, I am sure, and I&#8217;d bet PayPal is banking on being able to recruit new customers with this feature.</p><p><strong>Fundraising:</strong> PayPal has also added more information to its website about using PayPal for <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/fundraise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fundraising</a> &#8212; for personal reasons, for charities, for schools, and even for political campaigns. And, it has partnerships with fundraising platforms to give you more tools (for an added cost, of course). It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that <a href="https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203913489-What-are-my-options-to-receive-payment-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patreon</a>, a subscription site where fans can choose to provide funding to their favorite artists, integrates with PayPal (and also with Stripe).</p><p>Needless to say, PayPal has something for everyone, and overall it makes a great &#8220;starter&#8221; one-stop payment option. It&#8217;s nice that PayPal keeps innovating. Some companies reach the top and just stop trying to keep up. Watching these new services roll out is great because they empower merchants, and because it shows that PayPal is paying attention to how the market is shifting toward integrated, one-stop solutions. It&#8217;s also making online payments more feasible for all kinds of businesses, not just traditional retail and restaurants.</p><h2>Fees &amp; Rates:</h2><p>I&#8217;ve listed the most important fees below, but you can find a full list of PayPal&#8217;s fees <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees">here</a>. All PayPal services come with no annual fee, no setup fee, and no cancellation fee. The company also offers volume and non-profit discounts.</p><p>PayPal is very straightforward about its <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/the-complete-guide-to-credit-card-processing-rates-and-fees/">fees</a>, even if they are a bit higher than most traditional merchant accounts. And its pricing structure is absolutely competitive with other pay-as-you-go and payment aggregating services.</p><p><strong>Monthly Fees</strong></p><p>Remember there are two options for accepting PayPal on your site that charge nothing beyond <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/a-visual-guide-to-credit-card-processing-fees-and-rates-infographic/">transaction fees</a>. But If you opt for Pro, you&#8217;ll be paying a monthly subscription fee on top of standard fees.</p><ul><li><b>Paypal Payments Standard: </b>$0 per month</li><li><b>Paypal Payments Pro:</b> $30 per month</li></ul><p>The biggest advantage, as we noted before, is that the Pro account lets you keep customers on your page to finish the checkout process. You can even design your own checkout page. In addition, Pro subscribers get access to the Virtual Terminal to accept payments by phone, mail, and fax. Frankly, I&#8217;m a bit confused by the terminal is $30/monthly on its own and included in the $30/month Pro plan, but you might as well go for the Pro plan and get that hosted payment page, too.</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn&#8217;t include an option for recurring billing. Subscription services are hugely popular &#8212; and if you want to offer them with PayPal, that will run you an extra $10 per month on top of your Virtual Terminal or Pro plan. Still, PayPal does give you a decent assortment of options for customization, though my impression is that Braintree (and yes, Stripe) are more robust.</p><p>Finally, it&#8217;s worth noting that PayPal offers its own gateway to process payments. It has a high degree of compatibility, so it works with most options. The basic version costs you just $0.10 per transaction &#8212; but for $25/month you can get a fully customizable setup.</p><p><b>Transaction Fees</b></p><p>Regardless of which plan you are on (Standard or Pro), your transactions fees will be as follows:</p><ul><li>For all web transactions, you pay <b>2.9% + $0.30</b> per transaction.</li><li>For all swiped mobile and in-store transactions, you pay <strong>2.7%</strong>.</li><li>For all keyed-in mobile and in-store transactions, you pay <strong>3.5% + $0.15</strong>.</li><li>For virtual terminal transactions, you pay <strong>3.1% + $0.30</strong> per transaction.</li><li>For mass transactions, you pay <strong>2% up to $1</strong>.</li><li>If you are a 501(c)(3), you pay <strong>2.2% + $0.30</strong> per transaction for web transactions<em>.</em></li><li>For any chargebacks, there is a <strong>$20 fee</strong>.</li></ul><p>Something else that PayPal offers for merchants who consistently deal with microtransactions (as in, your tickets are under $10 apiece) is an alternative payment rate: <strong>5% + $0.05</strong>.</p><p>With consistently small transactions, you can wind up saving money on the per-transaction fees, which tend to be very problematic for small-ticket businesses.</p><p>Using PayPal&#8217;s own numbers, with a $2 average payment, you would pay $0.15 per transaction using the microtransaction plan, and $15 total on 100 payments. Compare that the $0.36 per transaction/$36 per 100 payments with the standard payment plan.</p><p>PayPal&#8217;s micropayments option might appear to complicate matters for some merchants, but it is a great way to cater to artists and musicians and others who want to sell digital products &#8212; especially low-cost digital products. So I actually really like it. I also like that PayPal offers nonprofit and mass-payment discounts and volume discounts. Not many aggregators offer any of those options.</p><p>In PayPal&#8217;s case, I think it helps to be a very big fish in a medium-sized pond. It can afford to take risks and experiment with features and pricing that leaner operations can&#8217;t.</p><p><strong>PCI Compliance Fees</strong></p><p>Something we haven&#8217;t discussed is PCI compliance. With merchant accounts, it&#8217;s not uncommon to pay an annual PCI compliance fee. If you are using PayPal Payments Standard, you are already PCI compliant. PayPal hosts the payment page, so it handles all those concerns for you.</p><p>If you use PayPal Payments Pro, things are a little different. With the addition of the virtual terminal and other tools, you&#8217;re not automatically PCI compliant. However, PayPal says it offers tools to simplify PCI compliance, but unless you dig, you won&#8217;t find more information about it. I did dig into the information and found out that the key aspect of this is a (free) Transparent Redirect feature. Learn more about PayPal and PCI compliance <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=merchant/pci_compliant_solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h2>Contract Length &amp; Cancellation Fee:</h2><p>All of PayPal&#8217;s payment solutions are contract free and have no early termination fee. It really is that simple.</p><p>That&#8217;s great if PayPal is your starter option and you want to upgrade to a merchant account later. However, if the rates work for you (particularly as just a secondary option), PayPal will also scale with your business. It is rare that we find any service that will help you start out and stay with you as your business grows larger, and we like that quite a bit.</p><h2>Sales &amp; Advertising Transparency:</h2><p>The best thing about PayPal is that its sales and advertising is very up-front. All of the rates are listed in <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees">plain sight</a>, so there&#8217;s no hidden agenda. It has, over the years, gotten even better about disclosing pricing and fees (such as its chargeback fee, which used to be hidden in the fine print).</p><p>Most of its business comes directly through the website or via referrals. PayPal doesn&#8217;t have the traditional sales team &#8220;pounding the pavement&#8221; and luring in potential customers with too-good-to-be-true deals the way you&#8217;ll find with some merchant account providers (and yes, some are far more guilty of this than others). There’s no doubt that PayPal offers real value, particularly for new merchants without a sales history, and it doesn’t make any outrageous claims or promises about the nature of its services.</p><p>It bears mentioning that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="http://gizmodo.com/paypal-has-to-pay-25-million-for-being-sketchy-as-hell-1705630163">filed a complaint against PayPal</a> on May 19, 2015. In the complaint, it alleged that PayPal was responsible for a myriad of sketchy practices, such as false advertising, refusing to provide consumers with information, and even signing consumers up for credit accounts without their knowledge. PayPal settled up pretty quickly (as in, the very same day), agreeing to pay $15 million to consumers and another $10 million in fines to the CFPB.</p><p>This mostly affects PayPal customers, not merchants, and it appears to be an isolated incident. While I am frustrated by this as a PayPal user and a consumer, this doesn&#8217;t automatically lessen my opinion of PayPal&#8217;s merchant services. I&#8217;ll still tell you to be on your guard because every merchant should be paying close attention to their monthly finances and statements, regardless of who they process with.</p><h2>Customer Service &amp; Support:</h2><p>PayPal has a bunch of different customer service and support options, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/US-PayPal-Community/ct-p/US"><b>Community Forum</b></a></li><li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/home/"><b>Knowledgebase</b></a></li><li><b>Phone/Email</b> <strong>(Mon-Fri 5 a.m.-8 p.m. PST, Sat/Sun 6 a.m.-6 p.m. PST)</strong>: Judging from the online chatter (see &#8220;Negative Reviews and Complaints&#8221;), PayPal&#8217;s phone support is very inconsistent. Sometimes you&#8217;ll get a rep who knows what they&#8217;re doing, other times you won&#8217;t. My advice is to avoid calling them if at all possible. Answers to most common problems can be found with just a little bit of searching. Between the knowledge base, community forum, and quick answers sections, you should be able to find a solution. That said, PayPal does offer some of the best support hours I&#8217;ve seen outside of 24-hour support.</li></ul><p>PayPal is also very active on social media sites like <a href="https://twitter.com/PayPal">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PayPalUSA">Facebook</a>, as well as its <a href="https://www.paypal.com/stories/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>. There&#8217;s even an <a href="https://twitter.com/AskPayPal">AskPaypal</a> Twitter account where they&#8217;ll field your service and support questions Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time. All of this is pretty much exactly what I expect from a company that caters to startups and small businesses in the 21st century, but it is nice to see.</p><p>One major benefit to using PayPal is the sheer volume of users. Any time you encounter an error or a problem, you can Google it and the odds are good you&#8217;ll find a solution from another merchant who has already dealt with the same issue.</p><h2>Negative Reviews &amp; Complaints:</h2><p>PayPal is a gigantic company, and like all big companies, there are a very large number of complaints. Although we pride ourselves in doing our research, it would take months for us to read through all of those negative reviews… so we didn&#8217;t.</p><p>For reference, there are <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/specific_search/paypal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3,359 complaints</a> about PayPal on RipOff Report. Unfortunately, the vast majority of them are consumers angry at merchants who use PayPal, not merchants upset about poor service from PayPal. So it&#8217;s a highly misleading number.</p><p>At the time of writing this, PayPal&#8217;s BBB page has <a href="https://www.bbb.org/losangelessiliconvalley/business-reviews/payment-processing-service/paypal-in-san-jose-ca-210387/reviews-and-complaints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6,583 complaints</a> in the last 3 years (up from 6.527), with 2,423 closed in the past 12 months (down from 2,607). Again, you should expect many of these to come from disgruntled consumers who have had trouble with PayPal merchants, not necessarily merchants who are having troubles with the service.</p><p>I did read over some of the complaints, including those that are merchant-related. I was honestly impressed with PayPal&#8217;s quality of service. It&#8217;s real people writing the responses and explaining where the problem occurred. They&#8217;re genuinely trying to help where they can. If you go through the BBB, the odds are good you can probably get whatever help you need &#8212; it just might take a little while.</p><p>We&#8217;ve read enough merchant complaints to know that there is one major problem with Paypal:</p><ul><li><b>Withheld funds, freezing of accounts, and termination of accounts:</b> PayPal is quick to act when it comes to suspicion of fraud. The company has a <a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/html/newsweek-071601.html">history</a> of dealing with major fraud issues, so naturally, it scrutinizes accounts pretty closely. If you think that your business falls into the <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/highrisk-merchant/">high-risk</a> category, then you should know that it&#8217;s possible PayPal may withhold some of your funds or even freeze or shut your account down. It may be best to go with a high-risk processor like <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/durango-merchant-services-review/">Durango Merchant Services</a> or <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/payline-data-review/">Payline Data</a> instead. You can also learn how to avoid holds, freezes, and terminations <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/avoid-merchant-account-holds-freezes-terminations/">here</a>.</li></ul><p>That said, this isn&#8217;t a problem unique to PayPal. Other aggregators, including Square and Stripe, have a similar reputation. It is the nature of the &#8220;come as you are&#8221; business model &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to get an account with minimal history, but there&#8217;s an inherently higher risk.</p><p>In addition to the withheld funds issue, here are some other common complaints:</p><ul><li><b>High transactions fees:</b> Compared to a traditional merchant account, PayPal&#8217;s transaction fees are higher. Visa&#8217;s <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/the-complete-guide-to-credit-card-processing-rates-and-fees/">wholesale rates</a> for an eCommerce transaction are anywhere between 1.5% and 2.4% + $0.10 per transaction. At 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction, PayPal&#8217;s rate is over that amount, even when you factor in a merchant service provider&#8217;s markup. While you can get volume discounts from PayPal, the promise of lower rates is a mark in favor of getting a merchant account when it becomes viable.</li><li><b>Inconsistent phone-based customer service:</b> Most merchants will rarely have to call PayPal&#8217;s customer service line, but those that have done so complain that the quality of service can be inconsistent. Some reps are obviously more knowledgeable than others. The good thing is that PayPal has a whole slew of other service and support options (e.g., the knowledgebase, forum, email, etc.), so chances are you can find your answer without having to call in.</li><li><b>Limited seller protection:</b> PayPal is probably more famous for its buyer protection. As a merchant, you do have some protections, though many merchants complain about the lack of effectiveness. Know what <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/security/seller-protection">Seller Protection</a> entails and in which circumstances it applies. It may not be much, but forewarned is forearmed, as the saying goes.</li></ul><h2>Positive Reviews &amp; Testimonials:</h2><p>Much like the negative reviews, there were entirely too many positive reviews for us to read through all of them, but here are the common positives that we encountered in the reviews we did read:</p><ul><li><b>Easy setup:</b> Most business owners rave about how easy it is to setup a PayPal account. If you&#8217;re exclusively offering PayPal Payments Standard, then you can get started almost instantly.</li><li><b>Widely accepted:</b> PayPal has a very large user base, which makes it a trustworthy payment source for everyone. If you&#8217;re just getting your business off the ground, then starting with something like PayPal is a good choice. The name recognition and trust associated with PayPal (especially with its buyer protections) can be a serious asset in the early days of operation.</li><li><b>Almost-instant access to cash:</b> Your PayPal transactions clear almost immediately, so you can spend the money in your account as soon as you have it — provided the place where you&#8217;re spending it accepts PayPal, of course. If you want your money anywhere, don&#8217;t overlook the PayPal Business debit card, which spends like a debit card, but deducts directly from your PayPal account.</li><li><b>Multiple products/services under one roof:</b> PayPal offers you everything you need to process online or mobile payments (e.g., payment gateway, payment forms, virtual terminal, invoicing, micropayments, recurring billing, etc.). It really is a solution that will grow with you.</li><li><b>Transparent pricing:</b> As mentioned earlier, what you see is what you get with PayPal. There are no setup fees, annual fees, <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/merchant-account-early-cancellation-fee/">cancellation fees</a>, or <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/what-are-downgrades-and-how-much-are-they-costing-you/">downgrades</a> for sellers.</li></ul><h2>Integrations &amp; Add-Ons:</h2><p>PayPal integrates with a huge number of applications from shopping carts to accounting software to shipping applications and email marketing software. There are just way too many to write out, but you can find the full list <a href="https://www.paypal-marketing.com/paypal/html/hosted/emarketing/partner/directory/">here</a>.</p><p>Here’s a small selection of some favorites:</p><p><b>E-Commerce</b></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/shopify-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shopify</a></li><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/magento-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magento</a></li><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/xcart-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Cart</a></li><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/3dcart-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3dcart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/bigcommerce-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BigCommerce</a></li><li><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/wix-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wix</a></li><li><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/big-cartel-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Cartel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/spark-pay-online-store-builder-americommerce-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spark Pay</a></li><li><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/volusion-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Volusion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/woocommerce-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WooCommerce</a></li></ul><p><b>In-Store</b></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/vend-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vend</a></li><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/ncr-silver-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCR Silver</a></li><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/revel-systems-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revel</a></li><li><a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/touchbistro-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TouchBistro</a></li></ul><p>There&#8217;s an obvious benefit to having so many integration options. You won&#8217;t have to worry about whether your shopping cart is compatible or not because it most likely is. The same goes for major accounting applications like <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/quickbooks-online-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickBooks</a>. And there&#8217;s no shortage of well-known, robust POS solutions for retail stores and restaurants. PayPal has ALL the bases covered in this regard. It really does seem to be trying to make payment processing accessible to everyone.</p><h2>Final Verdict:</h2><p>PayPal is a great payment option to start with, and there&#8217;s no question you should keep it around as a backup form of payment if you sell online. Account setup is fast, it&#8217;s easy to use, and it&#8217;s widely accepted. If you&#8217;re a brand new business and you need to accept payments quickly, PayPal is the way to go. The mobile integration, <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-here-review/">PayPal Here</a>, is seamless, which is useful for retailers and vendors who want to accept payments on the go, and there are plenty of POS options if you need something more advanced.</p><p>As your business grows, and you exceed $10K per month in revenue, it may be more worthwhile to pursue a <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/merchant-account-articles/what-is-a-merchant-account/">traditional merchant account</a>, because the processing costs will be lower. But you should make sure that the merchant account provides everything you need &#8212; or that if you have to pay for additional services that they don&#8217;t exceed the costs of using PayPal.</p><p>Don&#8217;t forget that company has a trigger-happy underwriting and risk department that has been known to hold money, freeze, and even terminate accounts. It&#8217;s important that you read over PayPal&#8217;s terms of service, understand its policies regarding buyer and seller protection, and do what you can to protect yourself and your business. You can learn how to <a href="https://www.merchantmaverick.com/avoid-merchant-account-holds-freezes-terminations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reduce holds and freezes here</a>.</p><p>But despite all of that, the credibility PayPal offers beginning and small-time merchants, its widespread recognition, and the sheer number of features available are serious advantages. For those reasons, along with its ease of use, transparent pricing, and overall versatility, our PayPal review keeps its <strong>4-star rating</strong>. We&#8217;d love to see more reliability and improved customer service, which would easily bump PayPal up a half star or more.</p><p>We&#8217;re confident in recommending PayPal to you, but we acknowledge that like most other aggregator services, it&#8217;s probably not for everyone. If you need more advanced features and you’re processing a larger volume, take a look at <a href="http://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/payjunction-review/">PayJunction</a>.

So if you are a business delivering locally, or your customer collect, or if you are selling intangible goods (software, services...), do not use Paypal Merchant services. And because the Proof of Delivery need to match the address of Buyer, then broadly speaking, GIFT Merchants should not use Paypal as you are likely to NEVER deliver at the address of the card holder or Paypal account holder address.  For those merchants, all disputes will be lost, no matter what material you will give to paypal to defend your case. A while ago, we even started to ask our customer for photo ID, copy of the card used for the payment (only showing last 4 digits), a signed voucher....but no matter what material you will give  (logs, ips, screenshots, customer emails conversation, phone conversation recordings, customer ID, card copy, customer voucher copy....)... Paypal will vote in favour of your customer and will even charge you an "ADMINISTRATION FEE"  !!!! So, not only you will lose the payment, lose your product and on top of that you will pay something  extra because you cannot provide a DHL, FEDEX, UPS tracking number.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1406001#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1406001", "1406001", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Georges'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1403606"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Aleksey V.Lomov</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> May 12, 2017 at 11:43 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>Unbelievable.

They are very deceptive with their foreign exchange fees.  I live in Canada but have a US Dollar credit card (Paypal detests this!) attached to my PayPal account to avoid PayPals rip off foreign exchange fees.  However Paypal still charges fees on converting money even though you have a USD CC that can be charged directly.  You can call PayPal and have all your transactions charged in USD but you have to call them to amend your account as there is no info on their site to help you with this!  But even if they change the currencies for you it will only be for a limited time and they will change them back unawares to where they can once again charge you fees. I have probably had PayPal change my currency structure 4-5 times in the last 3 years without my permission.

If I feel submitting my credit card info is not secure enough, or if the merchant only accepted paypal, I used paypal. And it turns out I made a wise choice there. I didn't have problem making payments with paypal, but everybody takes your money without question and trouble, right? However trouble started with the first refund I had to endure with paypal. I made an online purchase but merchant didn't have the item in stock. They honestly admitted their fault and refunded the money immediately, sent me the refund credit invoice too. After a day it appeared on paypal as a refund but with a status "pending" and it's been there waiting over a week now. Paypal in the background charged my credit card for the initial transaction. Having received many refunds on my credit card before, I know it can take a day or two to receive the money back but never over a week. It seems, paypal showed it's true face. I will steer clear of paypal use in future and advise everyone the same, unless there is no other option to pay.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1399869#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1399869", "1399869", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Baris'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1399363"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">George</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> April 25, 2017 at 4:27 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>PayPal is indeed a very funny company,  one that I will be substituting after my last transaction this month.

Paypal was designed to offer a bridge for buyers and sellers as well as individuals to manage money digitally. As far as the trust rating, I would be less inclined to rate them as a whole because the trustworthy factor is based mostly on how those employed by PayPal utilize the information they have the ability or priveledge to access. In my experiences, PayPal once made alot of my online dependancies a very trusting experience due to how they handled my issues whenever I had any. But I've been a very long time user of the PayPal system, as well as several other online credit card accounts, Banks, etc... And PayPal by far has one of the worst site layouts with limited abilites that has even at times cost me greatly. I've caught their online reps lying to me to pretty much sweep an issue aunder the carpet. I've caught issue where they allowed money to be mis-appropriated/mismanaged and although I had them cornered dead to rights as beinbg guilty of mis-appropriation and mismanagement of my funds, they took no responsibility for it. This is due to how their employed reps handle more advanced problems that are in facvt critical in the business world of online finance management. Me, being from the United States, should not be dealing with representatives who reside in Asia or some other third world country as I have also noticed these foregin reps will favor an ebay buyer or seller who is located in their region and I hate evwen making accusations like this but I've seen more examples of situational discrepencies that almost look as if there are people employed by paypal likely working with online buyers/sellers to pull scams that they know PayPal's protection will compensate you for. Simply put, PayPal should be doing alot more to investigate the internal workings of their business to search for relationships that exist between their higher level employees with decision making powers and buyers and sellers who make obvious questionable attempts to transact on  store websites, but I am referring mostly to ebay. I do not participate in the ebay International shipping program. And I do not sell to anyone except those in the USA. But after a costly purchase was made by someone from I think lived in Japan or somewhere out there, I was told by ebay that all I had to do was cancel the sale on ebay and they would deal woth the paypal transactions that managed the money or moneys that may have transacted. Well, I cancelled the sale on ebay. then, Paypal tried to credit the buyer from my paypal accvpunt. thing is, the buyer never paid me. If he did, the payment would just be reversed. Unfortunately, someone at PayPal  must have been able to over-ride something because the funds were not available in my paypal account but they still tapped my bank account, which was the backup funding source when needed. If a buyer did not pay me, then no refund should have even been given. They not only gave the buyer a full refund from funds taken from my bank, but they also refunded him with some incoming funds I had show up from a few transactions that just took place too. I called Paypal immediately, had my words with them and their response was pretty much an absolute bunch of BS. They took no liability for the fact that my bank account was over-drawn from this action and cost me 7 fees of $35 for returned checks since it drained my checking account. Admitting to me over the phone that they were going to give back the  money that I was due from this mishap does me no good since it already screwed up my account. They refused to compensate me for the $245 in fees that it cost me for overdrafts and it also took them 7-10 days to put all the money back where it belonged.  I threatened to sue. I got loud. I made a big ordeal. who wouldn't? Because I was right &amp; they knew it. I tried to remove my bank as the funding source to see if this might interrupt things &amp; maybe I would be able to win the dispute with my bank for the over-draft fees by showing the time stamp of the transactions and other proof. It did not go well because as I was giving the paypal reps alot to think about in an online message, which would document as much as I could in writing, I tried to send the message and then got an error.  I suddenly could not log into my account. Sometime later I found that my PayPal account of more than 12 years was deleted. And I was told it cannot be restored. And, they refused to give me all of statement data which proved they actually were guilty of misappropriation/mismanagement of funds. I was again infuriated, made more calls, &amp; began to document the name names of reps with whom I spoke and the details of conversations. I was urgently trying to get on top of this and resolve it.   PayPal has painted the picture that incriminates them, along with Ebay and Synchrony Bank. I believe they are a corrupt trio of businesses that seem to work in tandem while getting away with crimes that earn them as little s pennies and sometimes add up to be a very large sums of money. Pinching pennies is one thing. Stealing them from the wallets and purses of your clients is a shameful action. But the greed to try and hide it is quite the admission of guilt that shows PayPal is condoning these actions. I have a long detailed sumary of the rest of my experience from 2016 that is too much to list here but there is enough evidence and proof to exploit all 3 of these businesses towards a possible convictions in a court of law. PayPal, Ebay, &amp; Synchrony Bank have skeletons in the closet. The world deserves to know the truth</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1396254#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1396254", "1396254", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to NuNYaBiZiNeSS'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1395366"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Michel R.</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> April 5, 2017 at 9:11 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I used PayPal to sell my software online for 8 years, and over the years I've had some dodgy buyers who tried to get their money back directly by opening a dispute with PayPal, and everytime I could explain the situation and PayPal would decide in my favour, things went smoothly enough.That was years ago with no such incidents for a few years, until a few days ago a buyer simply opened a dispute only stating "Product will not download, please refund.", and my problem isn't just that PayPal sided with her for no reason, the problem is that my options were only limited to refunding, providing proof of refund or providing a shipping number, which doesn't make sense in my case, there was no alternative! I tried the shipping number form but it wouldn't even submit, so I tried the form for providing proof of refund to explain the situation (since it was the only way I could get a word in), which of course was in itself quite maddening (either prove you refunded or that you FedEx'd something??), and of course PayPal sided with the fraudulent buyer for no stated reason and all I have to appeal is pretending like I already refunded the buyer, it's absurd. They changed their system, it wasn't like this before, now they don't let you get a word in, you must provide a shipping tracking number and that's it, doesn't matter if you specific it was intangible/virtual goods.So the problem is twofold:1) Their dispute system is absurdly designed, you can't explain the situation, it's a faceless form that will only accept a tracking number as a response2) Now you know anyone who buys any software through PayPal can get their money back using the magic words "Product will not download, please refund." They've made thousands of dollars in transaction fees thanks to me, and they're siding with someone who can't even be bothered to describe a legitimate problem and even refuses to communicate with me (I have no idea what the buyer's actual problem was, and neither does PayPal)?So this is why people who sell software should not use PayPal, one day someone who wants their money back for some reason will get their money back and there's nothing you can do about it. I actually kind of wish more people would use the magic words "Product will not download, please refund." to get their money back so that more people would wake up to the lousy job PayPal is now doing with handling disputes.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-2" style="width:32px"> 2 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1395366#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1395366", "1395366", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Michel R.'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1394356"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Billy Fulk</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> March 31, 2017 at 10:04 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I am new to PayPal!  In fact I've only had seven transactions in the last two months with them.  Three of those transactions I have gotten paid at a reasonable time  just to be fair.  Two I had to continually call to try to get through to customer service and then be told the rules and regulations over and over again. Of how it works! One particular transaction I waited  29 days  from the time PayPal received the money to actually me getting it.  Most recently 3-31-17 . I was told by PayPal that I would receive money  The very next day they actually gave me a time of  12:05 AM on 3-31-17  I waited up to try to get it transferred into my bank account. It's 12:30 AM it was not there. At 7:30 AM I called PayPal and they said that they were sorry that they would have it put into my account in 5 to 10 minutes. Keep in mind I am calling PayPal directly and it's a PayPal people who are telling me this.  I waited two hours and I proceeded to call PayPal back and they proceeded to tell me that it wouldn't be available till the next day which is Saturday and there's nothing my bank can do about it until Monday.  Everyone of the PayPal  employees that I spoke to would go down and tell me all the rules and regulations. The bottom line is when they tell me that it's supposed to be there at a certain time it should be there. I feel that the PayPal employees failed on this matter.  The last employee that I talked to was very rude for the fact that I was upset ... I get that! But still PayPal should teach their people how to conduct themselves when a customer is frustrated .  Unsatisfied customer !  Terrible customer service  On this certain transaction.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1394356#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1394356", "1394356", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Billy Fulk'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1392660"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Kayla</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> March 26, 2017 at 1:42 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I sent money to a wrong account.

I used paypal funds in my account to make a purchase. When my purchase arrived it was NOT what I bought. Because I used paypal funds and not a real credit card- I'm unable to to get my money back without returning the bogus item to China ( which would cost just about as much as the original purchase). Seller refuses to pay return shipping, Seller gets to keep my money, and I'm out the purchase price. Lesson here is if you really want to be protected don't use money in your paypal account- use a real credit card. One that will recognize fraud for fraud and won't hold you liable when a seller pulls a dirty trick like this. Paypal has no power or authority to make things right for the buyer.Also, beware of overseas sellers. If this seller site had let it be known they were based in China I never would have bought.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1391441#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1391441", "1391441", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Kathy Fennell'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1390600"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">aimee</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> March 18, 2017 at 3:52 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>My account has an open case for almost 3 weeks and Paypal asked me to submit documents like my photo ID so they can resolve the problem.

They could have just swapped the internal parts for a faulty one and got them selves a free working replacement for their faulty item and put me £70 down the drain.What is the point in me protecting myself with warranty stickers if PayPal are just going to ignore people that remove them?SHOCKING.I guess if you just complain about anything you get your money back, so if you can't beat them, join them!</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1385325#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1385325", "1385325", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Finlay Lawrence'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1383947"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Fernando Gelbard</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> February 22, 2017 at 8:49 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I have been using Paypal for a few years, with almost no glitches. Today I found a renewal charge for $ 29.95 from a non USA developer, Wondershare.. for a Mac program that apparently I bought 2 years ago. I called Paypal. I could barely hear the agent which seemed to be outside the USA. She cancelled the future renewals (which to begin with I never authorized). I requested a refund. That requiered to talk to "another department". She transferred me and after a surreal conversation, the lady told me "but you are talking to Ebay" . I was transferred to the wrong company!!. I tried again Paypal, another nice lady, whom I could barely hear, told me I can't get a refund that I should talk to the merchant...I insisted I had nothing to do with the charge. She put me on hold for another department? and after a certain period of time I hanged up and decided to take the loss of $ 29.95.My concern is...what happened with Paypal? What changed? Last time, long ago when I had a similar problem Paypal credited a refund. Today, Paypal sounded like a banana republic government ministery, and not the neat efficient company I knew. Sad.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-3" style="width:48px"> 3 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1383947#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1383947", "1383947", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Fernando Gelbard'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1383838"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Ashfaq Mohammad</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> February 22, 2017 at 12:57 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>Paypal holding my non profit business money which I try to put in my non profit business bank account.

For example if i receive 100$ USD then they will convert it in INR with a rate of $1 = 65 INR but when i send money in USD Then the conversion is like this $1 = 71 INR.

It seems as if their customer service representative's are following some type of script, and are not interested in trying to help you find a solution  to your problem, but a way to resolve the call instead. I had my account locked up due to some security block which was a preventing me from making eBay payments. The eBay sellers would  then accuse me of making up stories and not paying them and attacking my integrity. All the while I was constantly spending long periods of time trying to resolve the cause of my security block preventing me from making payments.  You're absolutely correct. He previous commentator said that you could contact PayPal many different times and get many different so called solutions to your problems. My favorite solutions included log onto PayPal on a different  different computer. This was false because I had a friend log on to their PayPal account on the same computer and there were no problems. Another BS resolution that they come up with is that the seller doesn't except PayPal. But this is BS too  because when looking at the eBay sellers check out page the only option to make payments is with PayPal. Another customer service rep started to try to get us to play around with her computer settings. That is an absolute no go.  They initiated this without even asking us if we had a Macintosh or Windows based computer. We told them to stop wasting our time and we emptied out the cachet and cookies of our computer. This still did not fix the problem.  Another customer service rep tried to say that the problem came from the credit card and not the credit card put up a block. We checked with the credit card and the credit card said that there was no block. Another customer service rep said that there was two confirmation charges  sent by PayPal to the credit card that we were using. We check the credit card online billing statement and did not see these confirmation charges. We waited a day and still did not see them. When we tried to  to a manager they just kept on talking over us almost as if they felt that if they just kept talking and talking and talking we would get discouraged and go away. They do not care about helping customers fix problems they only care about  with some sort of resolution, not a solution, to conclude call. Perhaps they get penalized if a manager's intervention is required. I am a preferred customer on PayPal.  This is one of the sh******t absolute sh******t  customer service companies I have ever dealt with. And I get blasted by eBay sellers who think I am making up my stories about PayPal problems. f@@k you. Finally after about 4 hours on the phone, hey PayPal customer service rep said that it was a matter of a setting that needed to be changed and that I would have to wait 24 hours. I hope they're right.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1373142#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1373142", "1373142", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Brian Ghilliotti'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1371448"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Alexander Blair</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> January 5, 2017 at 10:02 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>PayPal is one the most crooked companies i’ve ever encountered. I just had an hour or so long phone call with them and my bank today, about PayPal lying about holding funds. They took over $500 out of my account for a payment but claim it won’t clear for 9 days. So I made a three way call between my bank and PayPal and even my bank told them that sounds illegal. This company lies about so much it’s not even funny. One of their biggest lies is about holding funds. They’ve created this lie to be able to hold on to customer’s money so they can profit from gaining interested, before charging 3.9%. Rarely does their customer service dept. even assist anyone, they usually transfer you around for hours until you give up, or just ramble and repeat generic responses because they don’t know the answer. Also the answers change with every phone call. You can literally hang up and callback and get a different response every time. If you’re wondering who to fight PayPal contact your State Regulator. Here’s a link to PayPals website showing the licenses for every state in the US. Contact these departments if you feel PayPal is doing something crooked.https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/licenses</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1371448#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1371448", "1371448", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Alexander Blair'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1370267"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><a href='http://PayPal' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Britt</a></cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> December 31, 2016 at 3:04 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>Horrible customer service.

Had i known paypal had this many complaints i would have NEVER even bothered with this ****. My account has only been open 13 days. I received a couple payments for services all within maybe 3 hours totaling $125. At this time i hadn&#8217;t received my Paypal prepaid mastercard (thats just to reiterate the freshness of the account) so i sent the entire $125 to a friend who then immediately dumped it onto HIS paypal prepaid mastercard. Cool. I withdraw the money and go on about my way. Here it is today i receive a $25 payment for services (i have my own paypal prepaid mc at this point) so here i am thinking im just gonna be able to dump my lil money onto my card and im good. No. I tried several times on the paypal prepaid website to transfer my cyber space paypal funds onto my physical card just to continuously get the &#8220;Unable to blah blah&#8221; message. Of course like you all did i call their ****ty customer service who dont know **** and they called the paypal prepaid folks on 3 way. Even more people who dont know **** and speak non understanding ****in english. They tell me because i immediately tried to transfer the funds (which i didnt. I received notification of the funds around 6pm i didnt even attempt to transfer the funds til 7:30pm when i got off work) that it was denied for security reasons. [?????] Paypal puts so much emphasis on this **** &#8220;convenient&#8221; factor when in reality this is the most INCONVENIENT way to transfer money. They also told me that i would need to link a bank account to my paypal account to verify my identity which would charge $1.95 that would be reimbursed and i would be able to dump my funds then but i dont have a **** bank account and my thing is WHAT THE **** is the purpose of having the Paypal MasterCard whether its the prepaid or the regular debit card if you can&#8217;t ****in CONVENIENTLY transfer funds for immediate use?! Why are you telling me to go around the most &#8220;convenient&#8221; way?! I was on the phone with these people for 3 hours and 29 minutes total talking to a dozen people sitting on hold being transferred making three way calls for NOTHING. $25 lost im cyberspace.

I clicked on the link and was taken to my PayPal account. As soon as I was logged in I closed the bank account that was on file, and opened an account that I needed the money to come out of. I was never asked how to pay the $250. I received confirmation that the account was closed. I received an email saying the new account was open. Two days later I received notification that PayPal had attempted to take the money out of the account I had closed. I was charged by the bank $30 for overdraft and $25 for returning the electronic check. I called PayPal. The lady on the phone apologized, said all she could do was write a letter to my bank asking for the fees to be dropped. I took this to the bank and am waiting to see if they will remove the fees. The $250 was taken out of my new account. I didn’t know if the bank would remove the fees but was glad my son had been paid. Today, three days later PayPal attempted to take the $250 from the account I canceled again. The bank charged another $30 and $25 fees. I called PayPal back and am now being told PayPal will try one more time after this attempt and there is nothing they can do about it. After 15 minutes talking to the representative that answered the phone and being told there was nothing he could do I asked to speak to a manager. That was 45 minutes ago and I am still on hold while I type this. So by the time this transaction is completed I will be charged $165 in bank fees and over 3 hours of my work time because PayPal has no system to not take from an account that was clearly canceled. This is all happening the week of Christmas and has put me in a bad way. I will be rethinking who I use for my online business.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1366916#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1366916", "1366916", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Tray Hicks'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1366441"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">David</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> December 18, 2016 at 4:17 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I was always told that PayPal had the most secured credit card system in the world......not true! Recently there were fraudulent charges put on my PayPal Mastercard at a pizza shop somewhere in Florida, I live in Penna. and haven't been to Florida in 10 years and haven't used my PayPal MC to purchase anything from Florida or a pizza shop. How these thieves used my account to purchase something is beyond me! The real problem was when I reported this problem to PayPal, I had to talk to several CSR who could barely speak English. First they wanted to verify that I was the cardholder so they asked the security questions and I answered them all correct, 2nd. they wanted a 6 digit PIN, which I tried to explain to them that I never received one! Then they wanted to send a text message to my home phone, not understanding that it was not a mobile phone and after that they told me that I would be receiving a code in the US mail (it took 9 days) and to call back with the code to be allowed to enter my PayPal account! To conclude, they are not the most secured credit card company and the have the worst customer service that I have ever dealt with in my life!I now only use my PayPal MC account to buy things on Ebay  and use Capital One card for all otherpurchases!</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1366441#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1366441", "1366441", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to David'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1365790"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Virginia M Crocker</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> December 15, 2016 at 7:12 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I am in Pay Pal Hell.

They are robbers! Paypal advertising the option of making a payment for/from your friend, I decided to try it. For the first time and for the last time as well. I needed my landlord to send back my rent deposit. I sent him the request and he paid. Afterwards I found out the fee is 3% and I was like F*ck, the most expensive way of sending a payment. Whatever. Problems started once (couple months later) he forgot about it, thought it is some fraud as he rarely uses Paypal so he asked his credit card company to cancel the Payment. Card company asked Paypal to cancel the transaction, Paypal took money from my account and sent them back and then let me know about it. So before I had a chance to explain that it was a regular payment and not a fraud the money was already returned to the sender. The final result is: Although the payment did not happened I had to pay the 3% of the payment plus $20 for canceling the payment. What a scam! They have never acknowledged my complains about it and don't let me use my account until paying those fees for nothing.

Those kinds of shops or stores or individuals don't ship anything,  don't communicate, don't respond inquiries, but just charge the buyers wallets. If buyer complains about such shady Paypal merchant, Paypal returns the money, but never punishes the fraudulent business and never closes the store's Paypal account. I tested such stores and after fraudulent transaction was resolved and money was returned to me. Then year after year after year I kept test-sending $1 to the Paypal accounts of those fraudulent stores and those stores (shops, individuals) would just accept the $1 from me with utter silence, without asking what the money is for and not asking or providing any invoice. Really mysterious stuff. Also, Paypal support loves to insult customers by openly teasing their name and or surname, for instance instead of Johnson the Paypal support female would write to me: "Mr. John's Bum" and I am not kidding! I have proof of all I just said. This is how BAD corporate impudence has become after the 9/11.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1340661#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1340661", "1340661", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Robert M.

For a while now I have used paypal but very recently they messed up and refused to take liability for their mistake. I have my account set up so it pulls money out of my account on the 3rd. of each month. My account is set up in a way so that their is only money in the account on the day I am expecting money to be taken out. For some reason paypals system took money on the wrong day which caused me to have a negative paypal balance and a NSF charge on my account. When I contacted Paypal customer support I expected to be greeted with a welcoming face and Paypal's willingness to absorb the cost of their mistake, as any business should. Instead I was faced with paypal customer service that would not admit fault and would not absorb the cost of their mistake. Instead they kept persisting that they were completely in the right and kept trying to charge my account, even after I explain, over and over again, that money is only in my account the day it is supposed to be charged. As I explained, this is a way to keep my money safe. Still paypal refused to accept fault for this mistake and I have had to pay $22 so my bank will stop paypall from charging it. Even since, Paypal tries to get the money, which they are not entitled to. Even after formally requesting they take my account down, multiple times, they refuse to do so. My advice is to not use this company. As long as things work right they are fine, but as soon as the company does something wrong they are unwilling to accept fault or do anything to fix the problem. I would not recomend this company to anyone.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1325544#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1325544", "1325544", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Eric Lee Duvall-Winscher'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1324914"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><a href='http://yot.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>todd</a></cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> June 18, 2016 at 12:03 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>Thanks for providing excellent information about the pros and cons of Paypal.

If you need to sell on ebay, just use paypal ONLY for this purposes. If you want to offer your customers safe payment option, use Amazon checkout  service. Lack of Paypal on your website does not influent on sales at all. Why?- paypal false advertising. I called 6 months ago to PP , and asked for discount (if sales over 10K monthly, the rate is 2.2%). Rep told me this is ok, but after couple of months I discover they still chargeme $o.3 plus 2.9% per transaction- paypal doesn't have bank license to conduct business. They get money transmitting license in all states. This mean if paypal become bankrupt one day, your money may be lost for you forever. There is no FDIC insurance. As money transmitter Paypal do everything to keep the client money on  their system. All account  limitations are designed to prevent sellers to get their money fast or even back. - paypal only one merchant provider who doesn't conduct automatic ACH deposits/transfers. They need your money to maintain liquidity inside paypal. - because paypal doesn't have bank license it is very hard to get your money back if account is limited. You can sue Paypal only in 2 states , and they lawyers do fantastic job with Agreement you sign as merchant seller. I lost business couple year ago because of Paypal, and damage for me 1000 times worse that tiny profit I got between paypal merchant rates and other merchant service companies. The worse investment in my life (as many thousands or hundred thousands customers who suffer from paypal).</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1294669#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1294669", "1294669", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Peter K.'>Reply</a></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1340667"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Robert M.

You can easily set up an account and only pay based on what comes through. We pay for the Pro version to interact with our softwares so the % we actually pay is not what is quoted, but more like 3.4-3.9% even with volumes over 30,000 a month when you average the costs with what we took in. You can get a person, and get basic friendly help easily for basic things, but I find you don't get correct or helpful answers with how to properly have it interract with other softwares like moodle. You are basically on your own. I also don't like that to download a log, even with less than 10 items, takes overnight and it never used to. Very inconvenient. It is nice that people recognize and look for paypal and don't need to own a credit card. We will continue to use it, but I do wish some changes would be made and our voices heard.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-3" style="width:48px"> 3 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1290554#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1290554", "1290554", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Kate Clark'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1289177"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><a href='http://ebay.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Evan Kottiel</a></cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> March 15, 2016 at 10:05 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I have no idea how PayPal has 4 stars.

They&#8217;ve had a glitch with PayPal Express for over a week.  I called Paypal on Thursday and got nowhere.  Then I called again yesterday (Friday) and was abandoned while on hold for an hour.  So I sent an email and they got back to me with an email telling me to call.  I called just now, on Sat and got a recorded message that they don&#8217;t work on Saturdays.  OK I run a tiny company in Vermont with a handful of employees and I work on Saturdays.  Paypal is one of the biggest businesses in the world and they don&#8217;t work on Sat.  Unbelievable.  Weekend days have by far the most shopping traffic of the week.</p><p>Like most others who use PayPal, my store is my livelihood and I can&#8217;t process sales.

I begged paypal to not return the money as I wanted to provide more information to reveal the scam. They ignored my request, they ignored the buyers 3 contradictory statements which were contradictory to the post office, they ignored documentation I sent, they ignored due process and proceeded to assist in a fraud. I was scammed over $1000 by both the buyer and paypal. Paypal then waited until I had the exact amount from sales in my paypal account and then froze everything. They are willing to talk for hours but like a good politician do not say anything help to resolve the situation.  Eventually when my facts could not be disputed they simply lawyered up and said they would only receive these points through a lawyer and then after waiting over a year to get back to my proof said it was now expired. I am frustrated that ebay makes us use paypal. Paypal takes no regard for fair process yet I am forced to use them. Bad business, bad company and forced relationship.

Delivered the item to the customer's specified location myself, and the customer was happy with it. To my great surprise, now I have to wait at least 21 days to receive the paid money of the item to my account. Of course, both Ebay and Paypal charged me extra for using each of their services. But my issue is with Paypal, not ebay.What is more outrageous is this - when I called Paypal, they said that I should have known about the 21 days waiting period, when listing the item ebay emphasises it 5 times!!! Really??? However, he failed to provide any valid references to prove it. Then the Paypal customer support said, that EVERYONE knows about the 21 waiting time. Yet again, really? So how come I am calling the support? Finally, without asking me he just transferred me to another Paypal person, who hang up on me.This is draconian absurd way of treating anyone who would like to sell via ebay using Paypal. Paypal customer service is very poor now. The sad thing is - my buyer is trying to help me to get the money faster, while Paypal customer service member just hangs up on me!Don't use Paypal unless you want to get disappointed.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1263893#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1263893", "1263893", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to J_Jank'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1261700"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Bernard Nelson</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> January 13, 2016 at 10:28 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I had a customer dispute a charge that is clearly a charge in December 2015.

I run a monthly subscription box service and let customers know before signing up, when signing up, and after signing up that they will receive their first box 3-4 weeks after starting the subscription. This is apparently now too risky for PayPal as they want me to ship items within 3-5 business days. This is a personalized subscription that I hand make items for depending on survey answers from the customers. There is not stock on hand to throw in a box and ship out. This is why I put so much effort into letting my customer know to expect a wait. PayPal has effectively stolen my customers money as I cannot use it to purchase the items for their boxes.

This came out of nowhere. As it turns out they were right. I violated  a policy that  was a bit crazy. I had no idea. There was ZERO warning. No phone call, no email, nothing.  My account was limited.  for those who know what I&#8217;m talking about you know that you are at the mercy of Paypal.  All I did was saying over and over again how sorry I was to their customer service department. I followed up with several emails. I had to sign something and then hoped for the best.</p><p> The next day everything went back to normal.</p><p> So what is the new normal?  Well it doesn&#8217;t  include Paypal.  Paypal owns you. There is no way that you can work with them.  They can steal your money at a momernts notice.  I am now looking for another way to accept payments. Hopefully with a company that doesn&#8217;t own you.</p><p> Paypal is so large there chances of winng are not very high. How can the average person fight them? You can&#8217;t.

Since my account had no problem I had no idea how little protection I had. If they wanted to keep my money for 180 days they could.  I had under $1,000 so a lawyer would have cost me more.</p><p> My advice&#8230; Any money that you have in account should be money that you can afford to lose and not effect you. If you are a seller have another way to accept money &#8220;when&#8221; something goes wrong.  In my case it took 15 years.

I can't recall when I ever had normal service. When people give PayPal a favorable rating, my head wants to explode. In any other business transaction where a legitimate, legal payment processing financial institution is handling your purchase, the process occurs seamlessly. PayPal--however--randomly blocks transactions, leaks your credentials, and throws innumerable random barriers to use and a multitude of errors with no explanation. There is no outward-facing customer service at PayPal, and it regularly destroys relationships between business and customers by souring business deals and causing financial loss.In NO other endeavor is it the customer's responsibility to sort out transaction processing problems, but for some reason it's expected of PayPal victims. That doesn't even make sense! There is no real support and no one cares about customer relationship management because apparently no one in upper management is actually monitoring the activities of the company with respect to its customers. PayPal consistently rates at 20% (!) satisfaction or lower on legitimate consumer sites where the content is not paid for by PayPal or eBay. The company is rumored to have in excess of 10,000 employees--most of which are in customer service. Really? Did PayPal forget to buy them phones or something?This is truly the most awful payment processing company in the world--and like eBay--most people begrudgingly use it because shady, collusive business practices prevent competitors for entering the market.

Specifically, I have credit freezes on my bureaus which doesn't allow for an underwriter to open a new line of credit in a consumer's name. After talking to several representatives, they stated they would close the fraudulent account opened in my name and flagged the PayPal credit application as identity theft. A few weeks later, I attempted to make a purchase on my PayPal line of credit through eBay, a purchase of about $100. They denied the purchase which confused me. A few days later, I received a letter in the mail stating they needed to authenticate my identity. So I called them, verified all the needed information, and the representative stated I would receive a letter in the mail in a few days regarding the account. During the conversation, I told him this account had nothing to do with the other account that someone had attempted to open in my name, and I was confused as to why I was being put through this process again. When I received the letter, they stated they closed the account due to fraudulent activity which is bogus. No fraudulent activity has ever occurred on this account; rather, it was only on the second account someone else attempted to open in my name. Moreover, I believe PayPal really closed the account because I had also reported them for improper billing, specifically charging me more on eBay purchases than what was advertised. They have stated they were shipping charges, but this is incorrect and a blatant lie. I have records from eBay showing there were no shipping charges on these purchases. eBay always itemizes shipping charges when the seller charges for them.Because it is impossible to get account resolution through PayPal's customer service, I contacted the company through Facebook's social media messaging about the ongoing problems. I told the representative, Adrian, how dissatisfied I was with PayPal and that I was considering reporting the company to the Attorney General's office, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the BBB. I also stated I would not use my PayPal account in the future, even though only the line of credit had been closed, because I was so dissatisfied with their service. Adrian's response was flippant; he advised me to go ahead and report them, an extremely poor response to a major customer service issue. In addition, the company has recently disabled the ability to make comments on their Facebook page, whether it is a general comment or comments on one of their posts. I would assume they have done this because tons of people had lodged complaints on their page, making them look really bad or possibly setting them up for a class action lawsuit.Besides your organization, I have also reported this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Attorney General of California, the Attorney General of Kansas, the FTC, and the BBB. If anyone who reads this post has similar problems with PayPal, I'd suggest that you also file your own reports.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1158285#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1158285", "1158285", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Christina'>Reply</a></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1163198"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">rj hardan</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> July 22, 2015 at 12:43 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I had a very similar problem.

My account has several address where I send gifts to my children, grandchildren, etc..  We spent Christmas in Montana and my children and I waited patiently for the gift of a luxury hand knit afghan I ordered from Uggs as the big gift ($286.00) which I did not receive because Paypal all of a sudden refused to send my orders to the agreed on addressee, even after I had received notice my shipment would arrive before Christmas. the  I didn't receive any explanation or email to warn us that Paypal hadn't okayed it.  I have gone online and tried to answer any questions that would get me to the right customer service person.

Luckily, the $592.45 purchase was not reversed and the case is now closed. It seems that either PayPal or the Credit Card company on file finally smelled a rat or it could probably be that I had added "signature confirmation required" to the postage.I called PayPal, and talked to a representative somewhere in Asia, who told me that they sent me e-mails on the subject, and nothing else could be done to reverse the charges. I had no knowledge of such e-mails and might inadvertently erased them among all my other ebay transactions or it could also be that they just went to the junk mail. What about sending me letters by mail like any other reputable financial institution would? How PayPal can allow this type of Internet Fraud to happen? My ebay and PayPal accounts are linked together, and the transaction status are shown simultaniously in both sites, including the USPS tracking numbers that prove that the buyer received the items. Needless to say that the buyer kept the items for free.I've also filed a claim with ebay, and the IC3.Gov.

PayPal does not provide buyer protection for what they call "intangible" items or "intangible" deficiencies.  PayPal used that excuse to avoid assisting me in reclaiming $80 from an online seller despite clear evidence that the product involved has serious deficiencies and there have been prior claims and evidence. PayPal simply did nothing to "investigate" the claim - they simply closed the case as being "intangible".  Software is not intangible - it has to exist as code, it has to be measurable in operation and function, and it does or does not provide features that it claims.  These are easily determined as true or false.  My complaint was not about any intangible aspect of the product - it was clearly that there is a major flaw in the software and clear evidence that this flaw causes significant operational issues such that I could not and would not trust using the product.A software vendor could simply send you garbage and you will have no recourse through PayPal for obtaining a refund.  Since PayPal is a very common payment method for foreign vendors, independent developers and many smaller software producers this becomes a huge risk for the consumer.  Many software products such as browser plugins, WordPress plugins and independent apps are only payable via PayPal - for good reason - once you have paid you are on your own and all the evidence in the world that the product you purchased is flawed will not convince PayPal to take any action on behalf of the buyer (as long as they are making their cut of the sales, they have no incentive to chastise sellers for selling garbage and no reason to support refunds to buyers).  Once PP has decided against you in any claim there is no opportunity for rebuttal, appeal or additional evidence to support your claims - something they do not make clear from the outset; users are lead to believe there is a process, but in fact once the seller responds you likely have no further opportunity to contribute.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1157026#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1157026", "1157026", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Craig Heartwell'>Reply</a></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1157042"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Eric Hazelrigg</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> July 11, 2015 at 7:46 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>Completely agree with Craig and will add they also don't even attempt to pursue an sale that is a "custom-made" product.

The vender sent the wrong product, so I filed two separate claims, one with Paypal (for ONLY the amount I  charged directly to Paypal) and one to my credit card (for ONLY the amount I charged to the credit card).  Paypal said once I tried to recover charges from my credit card (even though it was ONLY the money charged to the credit card), it automatically stopped any action Paypal would take.

Fraudulent charges can have a significant impact on everyday consumers, although after dealing with numerous call center reps (US and European-based) for over three weeks, PayPal would never acknowledge this on any level. Apparently, I, as the consumer, have hours of time that I can take out of my own schedule to devote to convincing PayPal reps that they have already resolved my disputed transactions; apparently this is due to the fact that their customer tracking and call note systems are not aligned between different call centers. Not to mention that being regarded as an &#8220;inconvenience&#8221; by customer care reps must mean that customer care training must be sparse to non-existent in the PayPal corporate budget.</p><p>After using PayPal since 2004, I currently can identify no tangible benefit from using this service that justifies the risk for potential fraud, either as a merchant nor as a consumer.</p><p>As I type this, I am presently on the phone with an extremely defensive and irascible supervisor at the Irish call center for approximately 54 minutes. After 54 minutes,  the supervisor (who refuses to provide her name) claims that she is deleting my account, as PayPal is still attempting to withdraw fraudulent charges from my checking account, even though PayPal has already confirmed that the charges are fraudulent and have been credited back to my account (I read the confirmation numbers from the PayPal dispute center resolution email sent to me over the phone and this just confused and frustrated the call center rep further).</p><p>I don&#8217;t see how a company that has such difficulty managing basic account transactions can possibly thrive in an increasingly fraud-dosed marketplace.

Since PayPal's launch of their new graphical user interface (GUI) and perhaps even new functionality on the 1st of February 2014, my relationship with PayPal, collapsed in a heap not long after. Here's the thing, it's hard to give up a pal that you’ve known for some time. You know all their secrets, their mess ups, the joys, the laughs, the tears, holidays, their warts and all, so you blindly still keep it going as they are after all, your pal. However on specific occasions where the mess ups have just gone a tad over Mount Everest, and you have to just stomp your feet, and say enough is enough buddy! So, I said my adios to PayPal and wandered off to Payoneer, and I am enjoying that blossoming early stage moments building our new friendship. So, I'll chat about Payoneer some other time.The PayPal Classic Site was extremely simple, fast and effective to the point, where you could effect transactions blind folded. In fact, I would go as far as to say that I could train my cat to do my payments for me. So, why on earth have they changed it as now my payments and withdrawals are taking decades to clear? I cannot do anything on PayPal these days without tears and pain. If it ain't chickens, its feathers. Okay, so let's get down to it and here's my definitive list on what "were" and still "are" the problems:- New GUI &amp; Functionality1)  I cannot Add or Withdraw monies, especially "Withdraw"Here's my theory as to what my lovely Gangsters at PayPal Inc are up to, and of course I cannot verify this with banking data. Give me extra time, there are ways of finding this out, legally. I just cannot find any other reason as to why PayPal would delay payments and withdrawals? Most banking or financial products can afford a top class IT Development Team, so I know it wouldn't be them. At least, not on purpose. This has now become purely a financial issue. Personally, I am guessing that PayPal are withholding your funds to earn "overnight deposit", if you do not know what that is, let me explain.Basically, anyone that has a bank or building society account can instruct their banks to place their monies in what is known as "overnight deposit". Namely you are "lending" your bank your cash for 24 hours, and they very kindly return the favour and pay you interest for it. It's a very closely guarded secret, not many people know about it. Luckily, in my past career I worked with banks so I can confirm this is true. In the other words, The "Overnight Rate" is a depository institution lends funds to another, and the rate tends to be the lowest available interest rate.  It's commonly used by banks, multinationals and other commercial organisations, and believe it or not even charities! It's money for ol' rope, for basically doing nothing! So, I've used real PayPal figures here and this is how overnight interest rate is calculated:-PayPal's Current Total Assets US$265,901,000 x Typical Overnight Rate 0.01% =US$ 2,659,010 / Divided by 360 Days = US$ 7,386.14 Interest Earned Per DayThen, let's just see how much they can earn from all your monies over 1 month:-$7,386.14 x 30 Days = $221,584.20An average monthly wage bill for a Philippines Call Centre Staff = $703.23Hypothetically Paypal can afford to employ 315 Call Centre Staff in the Philippines on just your overnight deposits. As, it did not cost PayPal a cent or penny!Due respect to accountants out there, as I need to explain that "Total Assets" include freehold buildings, land, cash at bank, deposits, investments, inventory, vehicles, equipment etc but I am merely trying to use the best figures available to me, today 6th June 2015 from Nasdaq. Also, there is the other important factor where the overnight interest rate and principal amount will vary every day and all of PayPal's "offshore accounts" are NOT included! So, goodness knows how much PayPal has in offshore accounts.PayPal Ticker Symbol = PYPL (not yielding much results on the Internet due to EBay split)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overnight_ratehttp://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/paypal-inc-91149-15046?tab=financials2) PayPal's Major New GUI &amp; Functionality IT ProjectAs I was an IT Contractor myself, I know for a fact that any major software project or re-haul will need "Sign-Offs" from the Senior Executives at PayPal. So, if the executives are giving you all kinds of excuses that they do not know what is going on, don't believe them for a nano second, as it's simply not true. All we need now, is to find an ex-IT employee of PayPal that will do the right thing and become a whistle blower. Let's just wait and see what happens in the next few months. Most developers I worked with and know are free spirits, clean living and anti-establishment. It's only a matter of time!3) Other FunctionalityI also suffered issues with removing and replacing my bank account details. This was due to a company that I worked with 3 years ago, where they were still trying to access my PayPal and get a payment. I struggled with both PayPal and this company for 3 years, same issue every year!! 4) Need I Go On Anymore Apart from EBay SplitPerhaps, I have been most nasty and lacking in compassion. Is PayPal suffering from divorce stress syndrome with eBay? Are they in depression or post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD)? Or, was there a Pre-Nup Clause, that we the customers do not know anything about?5) PayPal Call Centre &amp; Contact WebForm is How Can I Put It ... "Hopeless" I must have called PayPal nearly once or twice a week over the last 8 months, only when I had an issue. You see most of the time, my transactions were stuck in PayPal. I think one particular payment was stuck with PayPal for nearly 1 month! Prior to the new GUI, my transactions were cleared within 2 hours!!6) Senior Executives at PayPal Europe and PayPal UK I have written to possibly every Senior Executive at PayPal Europe and PayPal UK, no luck here either! I will be spending the next few days collating data on how many times I wrote, called and pestered the Contact Centre and Chief Executives Office. So, watch this space as there was a lot of wasted toing and froing, with not much action from PayPal.As I mentioned earlier, I have decided to invest my time in developing my brand new relationship with Payoneer, as sadly PayPal and I no longer have drinkies at my local pub.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1138172#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1138172", "1138172", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Mala Papachan'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1134790"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn"><a href='http://petsonairplanes.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Online Merchant</a></cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> June 1, 2015 at 3:22 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I loved them for years, until this year and the new Buyer Protection started. I had a perfect reputation NOT 1 single dispute in 10 years and 100,000's of $ each year processed with Paypal. I offered Paypal and my own merchant provider. A buyer purchased from us and paid for the item and picked the cheapest slowest shipping option. She then contacted us 3 months later to say the item never arrived and she wanted refund. I check the tracking in the USA and it showed tracking not available for Thailand. So I tracked on Thailand Post, It says out for delivery ---- Recipient Moved No forwarding.It had made it there in 4 weeks and she has moved in 3 weeks (our products are for relocating) So I sent money to her via PAYPAL SEND MONEY for the items purchase price since refund was no longer an option for this old of transaction.Buyer insisted she get the shipping refunded as well, I refused. She did dispute and I got all documents including USPS international tracking from my Post Office showing shipped same day and cleared US customs in 2 days so we were very prompt.SHE WON... entire amount was refunded including the product  purchase price I had already sent to her for a second time. BIG FRICKEN rip off that a USA perfect seller with exceptional reputation with all the documents I provided still buyer wins and actually gets a bonus double payment for her item. I removed them as 2nd option that minute from my site and am happy to do so. They offer absolutely no seller protection and will completely veto your return/order policies. Even if the buyer is completely at fault.With this type of policy a buyer can order something cheap with very expensive Overnight service and then refuse to accept the package the next day and the merchant would be responsible for the entire amount refunded including the HUGE OVERNIGHT SHIPPING FEE. It is Crazy and MAKES no sense.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1134790#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1134790", "1134790", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Online Merchant'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1133848"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Robert</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> May 30, 2015 at 8:16 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>It has been 2 months now battling with Paypal's "customer service" to try and solve an issue which is not supposed to be there. I have around $500 which are listed as pending, however the transaction by the merchant was cancelled because the money were sent through another method due to some complications which I will not go into. The merchant had to contact the customer service himself to advise them regarding this issue, however they told him that the problem was coming from my bank. (In the meanwhile, they have never mentioned this possibility while I was in contact with them) I contacted my bank immediately and they told me that the transaction was closed and the money were in my account. However I was concerned because the transaction on Paypal was still pending, meaning that at any time they can retake the money. My bank told me that if they do so, it will be a fraud and they would go after Paypal themselves. After tens of emails to Paypal, they told me that they were going to pass this issue to a "Technical Specialist" and that I should receive a response in 24/72hrs. Its been a week now and still nothing. I think he is dead or something.. Now they simply do not respond to my emails! And the best thing is that I cannot close my account because this transaction is still pending. I will never use Paypal again!

I was not at my computer to be able to check the transaction and I did not recognize the name, so I said, "no".  I was advised that the account had been hacked and that I should call and alert the credit bureaus.  I did this immediately.  When I got to my computer about 30 minutes later I accessed my PayPal account and saw that the full name of the merchant was "America's Gardening Supply.  The charge was valid.  I immediately called PayPal and told them of their error and that the charge was valid.  Since then, I have called in 10 times trying to get this straightened out.  They are totally unresponsive and told me that since the account had a fraud charge, which they knew it did not, that I would have to respond to the affidavit when it arrived.  It took 3 weeks to arrive.  In the meantime, I actually had my regular PayPal account frozen and couldn't even buy postage to be able to ship to my Ebay customer.  After a long animated phone call, I was able to get the account unfrozen, but my PayPal credit account remains inaccessible.  I can't even look at the account myself to see if payments have posted or any transactions have occurred.  These policies are outrageous.  They actually have hidden my account from me and they have no policy or procedure that would allow them to reverse their course of action.  My prayer is that when they separate from Ebay, that we have another choice for transactions.  No credit card company has policies in place that operate like this.  I am vigilant about my credit accounts and monitor them at least twice a week.  When I have had a suspicious charge, I report it to the card company and they close that number down and send me a new card.  It is simple and effective.  I know this works because I have cards from Visa, MasterCard,Amex, and Discover.  They are consistent in how they handle suspicious activity and disputed charges.  I totally understand now why they can't even be rated by the Better Business Bureau because they have so many complaints against them.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1127516#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1127516", "1127516", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Carol LeDoux'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1090942"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Paul Lam</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> March 8, 2015 at 11:23 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I have unfavourable experience with Paypal a decade ago and I gave them some feedback.  I have not used them until last week because I sold an item from Canada to US and the buyer wanted to use Paypal.  The problem that I have with paypal is the currency.  Since buying and selling over internet is so global and there are more and more bank account can have foreign currency, why Paypal cannot allow different currency in one country.  For example, I am from Canada and I have both a CAD and a USD account.  Paypal needs a CAD account.  For some bank account, they can even have multicurrency in one account number.  With those account, a USD fund in Paypal should be deposited into the USD portion of that bank account without conversion.  I don't believe it is technical issue, I think they are ripping people off by currency conversion in addition to the commission and transaction fee.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-1" style="width:16px"> 1 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1090942#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1090942", "1090942", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Paul Lam'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1090149"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">peaceful balance</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> March 7, 2015 at 12:14 am </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>HORRIBLE use another vendor.  I used paypal based on reputation to run a my first ever gift certificate promotion, which ran for only 10 days.  I had paypal walk me through the best way to offer my special.  Money was deposited in my account, spent over an hour with several agents trying to find out why I couldn't release my money only to learn that since it was a gift certificate that it then had to be redeemed even though the client was charged - okay get that.  Was helped to create a link, sent to all of my clients and the redemption codes don't work.  I spent another hour plus on the phone yesterday to be told that they really wanted to help me but that it was best for me to go through tech support.  The agent helped me create my ticket and I was promised they would call me.  Eight hours later received a response to call customer service because there wasn't enough detail.  So, I decide to refund all of my clients, eat the fee and ask for them to just pay me - makes me look stupid as a business owner.  So, I log onto paypal this morning at 10am and there is a technical problem on their end, try again, then call after 15 minutes talk to an agent who again, "promises" that paypals updates will be done in a few moments. - it is six hours later - still can't refund clients and have someone coming tomorrow morning for a service which means I won't be paid unless I can show that I redeemed their money - this truly sucks!

Then, with my most recent transaction, going on a month ago, they have decided to hold all monies paid by buyers for 21 days!!!! So, the item has sold, I sent it the very next day, the buyer had received the item and we have both left positive feedback for each other. This was all completed a week ago and PayPal are STILL holding my money and will not release it for another week or so. I have entered the shipping details and PayPal state they will release the money once the item is marked as delivered through eBay - check! And the buyer is given 3 days to raise an issue - it's now been a week and they are still holding my money earning interest on funds that are not rightfully theirs to hold! If I had a bad seller rating, had any issues in the past... anything along these lines, I might understand.

Does anyone with even a limited intelligence think PayPal wants to steal $1.95? Notice they all want you to not use PayPal, but have basically zero to offer as a replacement. They also complain that PayPal's prices are high, which is also ridiculous. I can only guess that they are comparing the PayPal price with some advertised prices and not from experience. Small businesses pay more and that's life. You get better pricing when you order more. We all know that, so they pay the higher PayPal price of 2.9%, plus 30 cents/transaction. And of course anyone who has looked for a Credit card processor has seen the ads for lower rates. Here is the problem.. Those lowest rates are for card present transaction where you use a machine to send the card information. Online fees are always higher (even though I think they should not be, as the business has the risk). Most importantly, you do not always get your lower rate, either. The processors have a neat trick to charge you almost double. The call it non-Qualified. It means that those transactions are Not Qualified for the base rate you were quoted. One processor we had, kept bumping up the transaction until a full 65% of our transaction were in the non qualified section, costing us almost double. PayPal doe snot do this nasty little trick.Add to that, there are usually fees for monthly minimums, gateway fees, batch fees, etc. When ever a credit card thief charges a couple of thousand dollars, you pay the fee, then have to pay the fee again to refund the card and if you miss it, you get soaked with a charge-back fee. We have had several processors and have had every single trick in the book played on us. Large companies like First Data do not always send your charge-back rebuttal to the bank which means you automatically loose. PayPal Not only does NOT charge you for a refund, they will also refund your original processing fee, as well. We have saved over $1,000/month with PayPal from any other processor we have used. We pay 2.2% and a 30 cent transaction fee. All of our other processors gave us lower prices, but when we got our monthly statements and calculated our total cost, it always came to over 4% and that did not include charge-back fees. We actually hit 5.2% on some months. Disgusting! So go ahead and listen to the whiners, if you want to, but if your smart, you will add PayPal to you payment methods. There are just too many people who like PayPal and it is much safer for them, since they do not have to enter their credit card information on every order they make. Our sale would be about 40% less, if we did not have PayPal as one of our payment methods.</p><div class="rating-container crfp-group-1 crfp-average-rating"> <span class="rating-always-on"> <span class="crfp-rating crfp-rating-5" style="width:80px"> 5 </span> </span></div><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1061286#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1061286", "1061286", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Frank'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1030289"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Samantha</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> December 5, 2014 at 9:36 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I am a first time user to PayPal and I will NEVER use their services again. You would think a refund using a site like PayPal would be easy but that is far from true. PayPal uses credit card wire transfers to exchange funds from buyer to seller and most people would think that it would be the same from seller to buyer if need, but no that is not how it works. Even though sellers can get their funds right away buyers do not have the same privilege or respect in the reversed situation. They can hold your returned funds for 30 days and if they are not refunded by 30 days the only solution PayPal offers is to file a report and they will investigate. Also when contacting PayPal at 1-888-221-1161 the &#8220;customer service representatives&#8221; give you the run around and do not even have consistent company training or policies. I had several CSR&#8217;s and even a manager straight up lie about the issues with my refund and blamed my bank for the problem. I addressed  issues with my bank regarding PayPal to find my money had not been processed or transfered to my account/ bank. The lack of customer service and consistencies in company polices/ training is appalling. PayPal and its CEO&#8217;s should be ashamed of how they treat their customers and their company standards.</p><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=1030289#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-1030289", "1030289", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Samantha'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-1027860"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">A Seal</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> December 2, 2014 at 8:48 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>I will never use PayPal again,  customer service is horrible and they make it seems as if you can easily send and receive money as a service when in fact it is more geared for the purchase of goods.

If you have a serious business, Pay Pal is NOT the provider for you.</p><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=496045#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-496045", "496045", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Laura'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-468212"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">Rose Petgrave</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> August 5, 2014 at 11:45 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>PAYPAY IS AN INTERNATIONAL RIPP-OFF! THIS IS MY DETAILED ACCOUNT OF MY EFFORTS TO START UP A PAYPAL ACCOUNT &#8211; WARNING FOR ALL CARIBBEAN PEOPLE&#8230;SEEK OTHER WAYS OF COLLECTING YOUR MONIES!<br /> I APPLIED TO PAPAL APRIL OF THIS YEAR FOR  AN ACCOUNT TO COLLECT MY COMMISSIONS FROM MY ONLINE CLASSES ON WIZIQ &amp; ALSO FOR MY BOOK WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED THIS SUMMER. I WAITED FOR FOUR WEEKS BEFORE GETTING A RESPONSE&#8230;THE FIRST DEDUCTION OF $US1.95 WAS DEDUCTED ON THE 12/6/14. TO MY SURPRISE A SECOND DEDUCTION WAS MADE ON THE 16/6/14!<br /> NOW PAPAY STATES THAT ONCE A POTENTIAL CLIENT CONFIRMS THIS DEDUCTION THE MONEY IS RETURNED TO THEIR ACCOUNT. IN MY EXPERIENCE THIS IS NOT SO. I CONFIRMED THE ACCOUNT AND KEPT WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THEM TO REPLACE THE MONIES WITHDRAWN &#8211; STILL NOTHING. AGAIN I WENT ONLINE AND MADE A COMPLAIN ON THEIR PROVIDED FORM, AT LEAST THREE TIME WITH ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE.<br /> I DECIDED TO CALL YESTERDAY TO GET THIS THING SORTED OUT. I WAS CONNECTED TO AN AGENT WHO CALLS HERSELF CECEILE &#8211; I WENT THROUGH MY ISSUE WITH HER IN DETAIL. SHE PULLED UP MY DATA AND I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS CONFIRMING MY IDENTITY. SHE DIRECTED ME TO GO ONLINE TO CORRECT THE ISSUE. TO MY AMAZEMENT MY ACCOUNT HAD SOME OLD ADRESS TWO YEARS AGO THAT I AM NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH. I HAVE NEVER DONE BUSINESS WITH PAYPAL BEFORE. THIS DATA WAS ENTERED WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF PAYPAL AND WANTED TO SEE HOW THEIR SYSTEM WORKED. I DIDNT HAVE AN INT, DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD AT THE TIME. NO MATTER WHAT I DID HOWEVER THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT TAKE THE NEW ADDRESS THAT I SIGNED UP WITH MY CURRENT VISA CARD &#8211; YET THIS IS SEEN ON THE SYSTEM. THE WOMAN REFUSED TO CHANGE IT EVEN AFTER BURNING 48MINS OF INT. CREDIT TIME WHICH IS OVER US$20! I GOT ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. I STARTED THIS ACCOUNT FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES,, TO COLLECT FROM MY ONLINE STUDENT ON WIZIQ AS WELL AS MY COMMISSIONS EARNED ONLINE, IF THESE PEOPLE ARE STEALING MY FEW DOLLARS, WHAT WOULD THEY DO WHEN MY STUDENTS PAY IN? IMAGINE HOW MANY $1.95 THEY HAVE STOLEN IN THIS FASHION OVER THE YEARS. THEY ARE CROOKS AND HIRE THESE PEOPLE TO PLAY DUMB ONLINE SO YOU GET FRUSTRATED AND WALK AWAY, BUT I AM GOING TO SIGN A DISPUTE FORM AT MY BANK TO HAVE MY MONEY RETURNED OR WHAT EVER ELSE IS LEGALLY POSSIBLE.</p><p><em>This comment refers to an earlier version of this review and may be outdated.</em></p><div class="reply"> <a rel='nofollow' class='comment-reply-link' href='https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/paypal-review/?replytocom=468212#respond' onclick='return addComment.moveForm( "comment-468212", "468212", "respond", "13964" )' aria-label='Reply to Rose Petgrave'>Reply</a></div></div><div class="comment-top" id="comment-357956"></div><div class="comment-author vcard"> <cite class="fn">LOC NGUYEN</cite> <span class="comment-meta commentmetadata"> July 11, 2014 at 8:31 pm </span></div><div class="comment-text triangle-border top"><p>It&#8217;s very fast to deposit money into Paypal no questions asked.
