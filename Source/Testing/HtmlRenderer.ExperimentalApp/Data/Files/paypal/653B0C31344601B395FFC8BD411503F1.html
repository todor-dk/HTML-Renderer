<h3>Enjoy No Payments and No Interest if paid in full in 6 months on purchases of $99 or more when you checkout with PayPal and choose PayPal Credit.</h3>
<p>Interest will be charged to your account from the posting date (which is usually within a few days after the purchase date) if the purchase balance is not paid in full within 6 months.</p>
	

<h3>Avoid Interest charges.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Log in to PayPal.com to check your account information at any time to keep track and make payments.</li>
<li>We’ll also email you when your monthly statement is ready to help you stay on top of your purchases.</li>
<li>Just be sure you pay the amount financed for this purchase in full by the promotion expiration date
to avoid interest on this purchase.</li>
<li>You can even use the special financing offers on multiple purchases when you spend $99 or more
on each individual transaction.</li>
<li>Multiple purchases of less than $99 per transaction cannot be combined to meet the minimum purchase amount.</li>
</ul>


<h3>You decide how to pay.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t want to pay before the promotional period ends, you will owe the interest that has accumulated
at an <strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of 19.99%</strong> starting from the posting date (which is usually within a few
days after the purchase date).</li>
<li>This accumulated or deferred interest will get added onto your account balance when the promotional period
for this purchase expires if the balance is not paid in full.</li>
<li>Deferred interest amounts and expiration dates are available online and on your statements, so you can stay
in control of your money.</li>
</ul>	

<p>If approved,  Comenity Capital Bank will extend credit to you for the amount financed to pay for your purchase.  Comenity Capital Bank will pay the merchant on your behalf for the purchase.</p>

At the time you open your Account and request your first extension of credit, we will evaluate your request for credit. If we extend you credit, we will disclose to you the total amount of your Credit Line, which will be no less than $250.00. <br><br>
 
The total balances of all types of transactions on the Account plus transactions which have been authorized but not yet posted to the Account (but not including unpaid fees) may not exceed the Credit Line. <br><br>
If you try to make a Purchase or Cash Advance that would cause your outstanding balance to be above your Credit Line, we may treat that as a request to increase the Credit Line.

<p style=" font-style:italic;margin: 10px; ">For example:  If your Credit Line is $650.00, you have a $200.00 balance, and you try to make a Purchase or request a Cash Advance of $500.00, we may treat this as a request for an increase in the Credit Line. If we approve this transaction, your new Credit Line will be $700.00.
</p>
We have the option to refuse a request for an increase, but we will notify you of the reasons for any refusal. We may allow you to complete a transaction in excess of your available credit without increasing your Credit Line under certain circumstances, such as if you have a previous &quot;non-sufficient funds&quot; payment on your Account.<br /><br />
We may increase, decrease or change your Credit Line at any time. We will notify you if we do so. <br /><br />
From time to time, we may review your Account to ensure that payments and transactions posting to your Account are valid and not fraudulent and that good funds are collected for payments. In doing so, we may temporarily limit your ability to utilize the total credit available to borrow until the Account review is completed and/or transactions and payments are confirmed to be valid and fully collected.

    <td width="75%">There is a Grace Period of at least 25 days on new Standard Purchases and Cash Advances. This means we will not charge interest on these transactions if you pay them in full by the Payment Due Date. For example, if:
<ul>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">You make a $500.00 Standard Purchase on January 1 and a $100.00 Cash Advance on January 2;</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">We send you a statement on or about January 15 with a Payment Due Date of February 12; and</li>

You&#39ll lose your Grace Period if you pay anything less than the total of new Standard Purchases and Cash Advances on any statement by the Payment Due Date. If you lose your Grace Period, you&#39ll owe interest on any unpaid balance of a transaction to which the Grace Period previously applied from the first day of the next Billing Cycle and interest on new transactions from the date of posting.

<h5>10. PAYMENT APPLICATION AND PREPAYMENT:  </h5>
<p>We will use each payment in the amount of the Minimum Payment Due or less, first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on any Easy Payments Purchases, then billed interest, then billed fees, then the principal balance, and then any other amounts due. However, if you have a balance on a Deferred Interest Purchase, during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding its Expiration Date, we may use the payment, after the amount to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on any Easy Payments Purchases to pay the balance on such Deferred Interest Purchase.<br><br>

You may at any time pay, in whole or in part, the total unpaid balance without any additional charge for prepayment. If you pay more than the Minimum Payment Due in any Billing Cycle, you still must make the Minimum Payment Due the next Billing Cycle. We will use any amount in excess of the Minimum Payment Due to pay the balances with the highest interest rate, then the next highest interest rate, and so forth. However, during the two Billing Cycles immediately preceding the Expiration Date of any Deferred Interest Purchase, we may use payments first to pay the balance on such Deferred Interest Purchase(s). We may choose to apply prepayments to the Deferred Interest Purchase balances before other balances.

    <td style="font-weight:bold;">Arbitration Procedures</td>
    <td>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator or arbitrators instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.  However, the arbitrator(s) can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. The arbitrator(s) also must follow the terms of these Terms and Conditions as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator(s) to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of the subsection above entitled &quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-individualized Relief,&quot; shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org" target="_blank" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">www.adr.org</a>. <br />
<br />


The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the discretion of the arbitrator(s) to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator(s) requires otherwise.<br><br>

The arbitrator(s) will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator(s) shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different PayPal Credit users, but is/are bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same PayPal Credit user to the extent required by applicable law. The award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
</td>
  </tr>
<tr bgcolor="#ffffff">
    <td style="font-weight:bold;" >Costs of Arbitration</td>
    <td>
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by us should be submitted to the AAA in your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.

With the exception of any of the provisions in the subsection of this Agreement to Arbitrate titled &quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief,&quot; if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in the subsection of this Agreement to Arbitrate titled &quot;Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief&quot; is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.

Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to any notice address or website link provided in the Agreement to Arbitrate) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any Claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the amendment. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or Claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/home" target="_blank" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">www.paypal.com</a> at least 30 days before the effective date of the amendments and by providing mail notice.

If you write to us, in your letter, give us the following information:</p>

<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important; "><em>Account information:</em> Your name and account number.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;"><em>Dollar amount:</em> The dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;"><em>Description of problem:</em> If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<p style=" margin: 0px;">You must contact us:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.</li></ul>
<p style=" margin: 0px;">You must notify us of any potential errors<em> in writing by mail, through the Resolution Center on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/home" target="_blank" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">www.paypal.com</a> (if you have a PayPal account), or by calling customer service at 1-866-528-3733. </em>. You may email us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.<br /><br />
<strong>What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter</strong><br />
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px;">
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.</li>
</ol>
<p style=" margin: 0px;">While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit line. </li></ul>
<p style=" margin: 0px;">After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;"><em>If we made a mistake:</em> You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;"><em>If we do not believe there was a mistake:</em> You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.</li></ul>
<p style=" margin: 0px;">
If you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within <em>10 days</em> telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us.<br />

If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.<br /><br />
<strong>Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases</strong><br />
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the purchase.<br />
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
</p>
<ol style="margin: 0px;">
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (<em>Note:</em> Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.</li>
<li style="margin: 0px 20px !important;">You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.</li></ol>
<p style=" margin-top: 0px;">
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us <em>in writing</em> at: PayPal Credit, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094. or call customer service at 1-866-528-3733.  If your PayPal Credit Account is linked to a PayPal account, you can also communicate through the Resolution Center on <a href="https://www.paypal.com/home" target="_blank" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; ">www.paypal.com</a>.<br>

While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.

<h3>What is PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>PayPal Credit is a credit line that is built in to your PayPal account. You can use PayPal Credit during PayPal checkout on eBay and almost everywhere PayPal is accepted. In fact, set it as your preferred payment method and you’ll speed through PayPal checkout even faster. <br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>How does PayPal Credit work with PayPal?</h3>
<p>The next time you check out with PayPal, simply select PayPal Credit as your payment method. Answer 2 quick questions: your birth date and your Social Security number. Approval takes only seconds. Once approved, PayPal Credit will automatically be added to your PayPal account <em>.</em><br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Why should I use PayPal Credit for my PayPal purchases?</h3>
<p>Get more time to pay when you check out with PayPal and pay with PayPal Credit at most places PayPal is accepted. Plus, score valuable discounts and offers, like special financing on purchases of $99 or more, when you use PayPal Credit. You can also review all of your purchases and pay your bill through PayPal.com.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>I already have a separate PayPal Credit account. How do I add it to my PayPal account?</h3>
<p>It’s easy! Visit <a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/credit/accountLinking"> www.paypal.com/myaccount/credit/accountLinking </a> and follow the simple steps to easily link your PayPal Credit account to your PayPal account.  <br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>How do I pay my PayPal Credit bill? </h3>
<p>Simply log in to PayPal.com.  On your Account Overview summary, you will see your current payment due for PayPal Credit. You can use your PayPal balance or your bank account, plus, you can pay in full or over time (interest charges may apply).<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>

<h3>How does the "No Payments + No Interest if paid in full in 6 months" offer work?</h3>
<p>You can choose to make no payments for 6 months. You will receive monthly statements and can make payments at any time. As long as you pay in full by the promotion expiration date, you will not be billed interest. If you do not pay in full, interest will be billed from the date of purchase.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Is there an annual fee to use PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>There is no annual fee for using PayPal Credit.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>What is the Annual Percentage Rate?</h3>
<p>The Annual Percentage Rate is 19.99%. The Minimum Finance Charge is $2.00. Of course, you can choose to pay your entire balance by the payment due date and pay no finance charges.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>



<h3>If I pay late, will there be a fee?</h3>
<p>If a minimum payment is not received by your payment due date (found on your statement), you will be charged a late fee in the amount of the missed payment—up to $27 the first time you are late. Subsequent late payments will be charged a late fee up to $38.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>Does PayPal Purchase Protection apply to my PayPal Credit purchases?</h3>
<p>When you check out with PayPal and choose PayPal Credit as your payment method, the purchases are covered under PayPal's Purchase Protection program. <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security" target="_blank">See Eligibility</a>.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>



<h3>Do I have a credit line and how much is it?</h3>
<p>Yes you do. Here's how it works: after you've been approved,  Comenity Capital Bank will open a PayPal Credit account with a credit line equal to the amount of your purchase or $250, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>You can continue using PayPal Credit to make purchases. If those purchases cause your outstanding balance to exceed your credit line, then you will be evaluated for a credit line increase. This evaluation happens seamlessly during the checkout process. You don't need to do a thing. Best of all, your checkout won't be slowed down.
Here's an example of how this works:

<ul>
<li>If your first purchase using PayPal Credit is $150, your initial credit line will be $250.</li>
<li>If you make another purchase for $300 before your bill is paid, PayPal Credit will determine during checkout if your credit line can be adjusted to $450.</li>
<li>If you then pay $350 toward your first bill, you will have $350 remaining on your credit line. If you want to make another purchase using PayPal Credit for more than $350, PayPal Credit will determine during checkout if your credit line can be adjusted again.</li>
<li>You can always continue to make additional purchases up to your outstanding credit line, and we will consider increasing your credit line when your purchase goes above it.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>What does "Subject to Credit Approval" mean?</h3>
<p>PayPal Credit is a line of credit provided by  Comenity Capital Bank, an FDIC-insured, Utah-chartered, industrial bank.  Comenity Capital Bank will review and consider your credit report and other credit-related information prior to opening your account and establishing your credit line. Creditworthiness is determined by  Comenity Capital Bank and only takes a matter of seconds as part of the checkout process.<br /><a href="#">Back to top</a></p>


<h3>How do I increase my credit line with PayPal Credit?</h3>
<p>When you attempt to make a purchase for an amount above your credit line, it will be treated as a request for a credit line increase. Your eligibility for a credit line increase is determined by your credit history and customer history with PayPal Credit. This request happens seamlessly during the checkout process.
