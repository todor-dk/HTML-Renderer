<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

    <div class="headline"><span class="content">Editor's note: Tonight is the final night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and Donald Trump is expected to officially accept the party's nomination. He'll be tonight's main speaker, and pundits are wondering which Trump will come to the stage: the controversial, brash businessman or a more toned-down, general election-focused candidate? The evening's theme is "Make America One Again," and Ivanka Trump is slated to introduce her father. RNC chair Reince Priebus, Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel are also on the speakers' roster, among others. Festivities should kick off around 7:30 p.m. ET, and you can watch live video here. - Rebecca</span></div>

      <div class="description padded"><p><b>PayPal Holdings, Inc.</b> is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders. PayPal is one of the world's largest Internet payment companies. The company operates as a payment processor for online vendors, auction sites and other commercial users, for which it charges a fee.</p>
<p>Established in 1998, PayPal had its IPO in 2002, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay later that year.</p>
<p>In 2014, PayPal moved $228 billion in 26 currencies across more than 190 nations, generating a total revenue of $7.9 billion (44% of eBay’s total profits). The same year, eBay announced plans to spin-off PayPal into an independent company by mid-2015 and this was completed on July 18, 2015. On July 20, 2015, PayPal had its second IPO that valued the company at $46.6 billion.</p></div>

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"daily_count":3,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"tech","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","name":"tech","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","item_count":13501,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","geohash":"","image_height":612,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","category":"Topic","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_current":37,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EHus","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Tom Brew","id":7,"username":"tom.brew","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","last_name":"Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Tom"},"whoas":99,"data_type":null,"url":""},{"url_text":"Read more on downdetector.com","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EHtf","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"Editor's note: Dyn reported at least two DDoS attacks Friday, one at 7:10 a.m. ET and another at 11:52 a.m. ET.

The brand was first introduced on December 3, 1994 in Japan with the launch of the original PlayStation console.<\/p>\n<p>The original console in the series was the first video game console to ship 100 million units, 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. Sony's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013. Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling 1 million consoles in its first 24 hours on sale, becoming the fastest selling console in history.<\/p>\n<p>The first handheld game console in the PlayStation series (called the PlayStation Portable or PSP), sold a total of 80 million units worldwide by November 2013. Its successor, the PlayStation Vita, which launched in Japan on December 17, 2011 and in most other major territories in February 2012, had sold over 4 million units by January 2013. PlayStation TV is a microconsole and a non-portable variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld game console. Other hardware released as part of the PlayStation series includes the PSX, a digital video recorder which was integrated with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, though it was short lived due to its high price and was never released outside Japan, as well as a Sony Bravia television set which has an integrated PlayStation 2. The main series of controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, which is a line of vibration-feedback gamepad having sold 28 million controllers as of June 28, 2008.<\/p>\n<p>The PlayStation Network is an online service with over 110 million users worldwide (as of July 2013). It comprises an online virtual market, the PlayStation Store, which allows the purchase and download of games and various forms of multimedia, a subscription-based online service known as PlayStation Plus and a social gaming networking service called PlayStation Home, which had over 41 million users worldwide at the time of its closure in March 2015. PlayStation Mobile (formerly PlayStation Suite) is a software framework that provides PlayStation content on mobile devices. Version 1.xx supports both PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV and certain devices that run the Android operating system, whereas version 2.00 released in 2014 would only target PlayStation Vita and (optionally) PlayStation TV. Content set to be released under the framework consist of only original PlayStation games currently.<\/p>\n<p>7th generation PlayStation products also use the XrossMediaBar, which is an award-winning graphical user interface. A new touch screen-based user interface called LiveArea was launched for the PlayStation Vita, which integrates social networking elements into the interface. Additionally, PlayStation 2 and original PlayStation 3 consoles also featured support for Linux-based operating systems, though this has since been discontinued. The series has also been known for its numerous marketing campaigns, the latest of which being the \"Greatness Awaits\" commercials in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The series also has a strong line-up of first-party titles due to Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, a group of fifteen first-party developers owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment which are dedicated to developing first-party games for the series. In addition, the series features various budget re-releases of titles by Sony with different names for each region; these include the Greatest Hits, Platinum, Essentials, Favorites and The Best ranges of titles.<\/p>","links":"","id":6524,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"playstation","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/playstation\/","name":"PlayStation","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T15:07:53.589230","item_count":85,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=6524","latest_item_date":"2016-12-07T13:53:24.335364","created_on":"2012-09-19T18:17:10","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/00\/PlayStation_logo.svg\/512px-PlayStation_logo.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":397,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=6524","category":"Product","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PlayStation"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CM","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twitter\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/136\/","local_url":"\/topic\/twitter\/","description":"<p><b>Twitter<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"'w' in 'wind'\">w<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/ər\/ 'er' in 'finger'\">ər<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>) is an online news and social networking service where users post and read short 140-character messages called \"tweets\".

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix.

It indicates how the revenues (money received from the sale of products and services before expenses are taken out, also known as the “top line”) are transformed into the net income (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for, also known as “net profit” or the “bottom line”). It displays the revenues recognized for a specific period, and the cost and expenses charged against these revenues, including write-offs (e.g., depreciation and amortization of various assets) and taxes. The purpose of the income statement is to show managers and investors whether the company made or lost money during the period being reported.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to remember about an income statement is that it represents a period of time like the cash flow statement. This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.<\/p>\n<p>Charitable organizations that are required to publish financial statements do not produce an income statement. Instead, they produce a similar statement that reflects funding sources compared against program expenses, administrative costs, and other operating commitments. This statement is commonly referred to as the statement of activities. Revenues and expenses are further categorized in the statement of activities by the donor restrictions on the funds received and expended.<\/p>\n<p>The income statement can be prepared in one of two methods. The Single Step income statement takes the simpler approach, totaling revenues and subtracting expenses to find the bottom line. The more complex Multi-Step income statement (as the name implies) takes several steps to find the bottom line, starting with the gross profit. It then calculates operating expenses and, when deducted from the gross profit, yields income from operations. Adding to income from operations is the difference of other revenues and other expenses. When combined with income from operations, this yields income before taxes. The final step is to deduct taxes, which finally produces the net income for the period measured.<\/p>","links":"","id":21968,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"earnings","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/earnings\/","name":"earnings","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:52:21.707067","item_count":3012,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","latest_item_date":"2016-12-21T21:31:27.460266","created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/49\/Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg\/512px-Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":269,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=21968","category":"Subvertical","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":318,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CjM","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PayPal\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/9870\/","local_url":"\/topic\/paypal\/","description":"<p><b>PayPal Holdings, Inc.<\/b> is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.

Scalia's death led to an unusual situation in which a Democratic president had the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court nominee while the Republicans control the United States Senate; before Scalia's death, such a situation last occurred when a Senate Republican majority confirmed Grover Cleveland's nomination of Rufus Wheeler Peckham in 1895. Conversely, in February 1988, during an election year, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Anthony Kennedy, who was the Republican President Ronald Reagan's nominee for the Supreme Court, though Kennedy had been nominated in November 1987.<\/p>\n<p>Political commentators widely recognized Scalia as one of the more conservative members of the Court, and noted that a more liberal replacement could shift the Court's ideological balance for many years into the future. The confirmation of Garland would also give Democratic appointees a majority on the Supreme Court for the first time since the 1970 confirmation of Harry Blackmun. After the death of Scalia, Republican Senate leaders announced that they planned to hold no vote on any potential nomination during the president's last year in office.

Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"daily_count":14,"active":true,"longitude":-95.845016,"kind":"location","slug":"united-states","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","name":"United States","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","item_count":28200,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","woeid":23424977,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","image_height":269,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","recent_count":3,"trend_rank_current":8,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/sD","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2731\/","local_url":"\/topic\/donald-trump\/","description":"<p><b>Donald John Trump<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman and politician who is the President-elect of the United States.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","links":"","id":2731,"daily_count":6,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"donald-trump","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","name":"Donald Trump","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T15:02:08.249596","item_count":4875,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","created_on":"2010-09-09T20:31:06","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":683,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2731","category":"Person","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":61,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

In the legal system of the United States, the Supreme Court is the final interpreter of federal constitutional law, although it may only act within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction.<\/p>\n<p>The Court normally consists of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Once appointed, justices have life tenure unless they resign, retire, or are removed after impeachment (though no justice has ever been removed). In modern discourse, the justices are often categorized as having conservative, moderate, or liberal philosophies of law and of judicial interpretation. Each justice has one vote, and while many cases are decided unanimously, the highest profile cases often expose ideological beliefs that track with those philosophical or political categories.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/huff.to\/2ctzyfi","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":98,"data_type":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/trump-peter-thiel-supreme-court_us_57d80d57e4b09d7a687f9b03"},{"url_text":"Read more on www.wsj.com","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D7Po","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"PayPal strikes deal with MasterCard to allow payments in stores - Wall Street Journal","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/942750\/","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/06\/paypal-strikes-deal-with-mastercard-to-allow","date_ap":"Sep 06, 2016, 11:31 AM GMT","id":942750,"tweet":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/paypal-strikes-deal-with-mastercard-to-allow-payments-in-stores-1473154200","push_content":"PayPal strikes deal with MasterCard to allow payments in stores - Wall Street Journal","slug":"paypal-strikes-deal-with-mastercard-to-allow","media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/06\/paypal-strikes-deal-with-mastercard-to-allow","ping":null,"date":"2016-09-06T11:31:00.005586","data":null,"source":null,"status":"published","updated_date":"2016-09-06T11:31:00.629768","pushed":true,"sponsor":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on www.wsj.com","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"www.wsj.com","topics":[{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BVEG","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Financial_services\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/319306\/","local_url":"\/topic\/financial-services\/","description":"<p><b>Financial services<\/b> are the economic services provided by the <b>finance industry<\/b>, which encompasses a broad range of businesses that manage money, including credit unions, banks, credit-card companies, insurance companies, accountancy companies, consumer-finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds and some government-sponsored enterprises.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"daily_count":3,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"tech","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","name":"tech","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","item_count":13501,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","geohash":"","image_height":612,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","category":"Topic","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_current":37,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/on.wsj.com\/2ck7eM2","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":26,"data_type":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/paypal-strikes-deal-with-mastercard-to-allow-payments-in-stores-1473154200"},{"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFj","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"Photo: PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel tells RNC crowd 'I am proud to be gay.

Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"daily_count":14,"active":true,"longitude":-95.845016,"kind":"location","slug":"united-states","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","name":"United States","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","item_count":28200,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","woeid":23424977,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","image_height":269,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","recent_count":3,"trend_rank_current":8,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":61,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution.

The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/29PpCxe","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":16,"data_type":null,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AdrienneVogt\/status\/756299298577326080"},{"url_text":"End of alert","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFd","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"More: PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel says LGBT bathroom debate is 'a distraction from our real problems'","importance":2,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/903679\/","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/07\/22\/more-paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-says-lgbt","date_ap":"Jul 22, 2016, 01:29 AM GMT","id":903679,"tweet":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/22\/more-paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-says-lgbt","push_content":"More: PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel says LGBT bathroom debate is 'a distraction from our real problems'","slug":"more-paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-says-lgbt","media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/22\/more-paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-says-lgbt","ping":null,"date":"2016-07-22T01:29:17.509678","data":null,"source":null,"status":"published","updated_date":"2016-07-22T01:29:18.819801","pushed":true,"sponsor":null,"url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"breakingnews.com","topics":[{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/RYZ","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Republican_National_Convention\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/66861\/","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-republican-national-convention\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Republican National Convention<\/b>, in which delegates of the United States Republican Party chose the party's nominees for President of the United States and Vice President of the United States in the United States presidential election, 2016, was held July 18–21, 2016, at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.

Some opponents of the bill describe it as the most anti-LGBT legislation in the United States. Some proponents of HB2 call it \"common sense\" legislation, while advocates of repeal say replacing it with an anti-discrimination law is \"common sense\".<\/p>\n<p>One contentious element of the law eliminates anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and genderqueer people, and legislates that in government buildings, individuals may only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. This has been criticized because it prevents transgender people who do not or cannot alter their birth certificates from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity: in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates, and outside jurisdictions have different rules, some more restrictive. The legislation changes the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to \"the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.\"<\/p>\n<p>The act also prevents municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies, setting a local minimum wage, regulating child labor, or making certain regulations for city workers. The legislation initially removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts, but was later amended to restore that right.<\/p>\n<p>On May 9, 2016, the United States Department of Justice sued Governor Pat McCrory, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, and the University of North Carolina system, stating that House Bill 2 violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and the Violence Against Women Act. On the same day, North Carolina's governor and legislative leaders filed two separate lawsuits against the Department of Justice to defend the law. Two private lawsuits are also underway, one challenging and the other defending the law.<\/p>","links":"","id":329063,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"arc","slug":"north-carolina-anti-lgbt-bill","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/north-carolina-anti-lgbt-bill\/","name":"North Carolina LGBT bill","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-12T23:01:56.377278","item_count":153,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=329063","latest_item_date":"2016-12-22T16:38:11.970330","created_on":"2016-03-25T19:38:12.151122","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/e0\/Government_travel_bans_to_North_Carolina.svg\/512px-Government_travel_bans_to_North_Carolina.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":324,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=329063","category":"PoliticsEvent","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Public_Facilities_Privacy_%26_Security_Act"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":151,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/O8","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Debate\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/928\/","local_url":"\/topic\/debates\/","description":"<p><b>Debate<\/b> is contention in argument; strife, dissension, quarrelling, controversy; especially a formal discussion of subjects before a public assembly or legislature, in Parliament or in any deliberative assembly.<\/p>\n<p>Debate is a method of formally presenting an argument in a structured manner.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, modernists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern States for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 to 1865, when he was assassinated, and the most recent being George W. Bush, who served from 2001 to 2009. The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation. Once dominant in the Northeast and Midwest, the party's core support now comes from the South as well as conservative Catholics and evangelicals in the South and across the country.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th United States Congress, Republicans have their largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1928 election and a majority of seats in the Senate.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFd","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":33,"data_type":null,"url":""},{"url_text":"End of alert","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFZ","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel speaking at RNC: 'I don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFZ","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":26,"data_type":null,"url":""},{"url_text":"End of alert","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFY","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, speaking at GOP convention: 'I am proud to be gay.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution.

The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxFY","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":49,"data_type":null,"url":""},{"url_text":"End of alert","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxDh","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"Editor's note: Tonight is the final night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and Donald Trump is expected to officially accept the party's nomination.

It is also known informally by its nickname, <i>The Sooner State<\/i>, in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union.

Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia.

It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions.

European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"daily_count":14,"active":true,"longitude":-95.845016,"kind":"location","slug":"united-states","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","name":"United States","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","item_count":28200,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","woeid":23424977,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","image_height":269,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","recent_count":3,"trend_rank_current":8,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/sD","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2731\/","local_url":"\/topic\/donald-trump\/","description":"<p><b>Donald John Trump<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɒ\/ short 'o' in 'body'\">ɒ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman and politician who is the President-elect of the United States.

As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","links":"","id":2731,"daily_count":6,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"donald-trump","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","name":"Donald Trump","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T15:02:08.249596","item_count":4875,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","created_on":"2010-09-09T20:31:06","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":683,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2731","category":"Person","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":61,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation.

History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":27,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/MGN","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/46513\/","local_url":"\/topic\/editor-items\/","description":"","links":"","id":46513,"daily_count":7,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"zspecial","slug":"editor-items","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/editor-items\/","name":"editor items","wikipedia_content_date":"2015-07-02T18:41:39","item_count":5080,"facebookchat":"","image_width":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=46513","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","created_on":"2013-10-08T01:02:58.477256","woeid":null,"image_url":"","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=46513","category":"Special","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_current":27,"wikipedia_url":""}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DxDh","note":"Tonight is the final night of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, and Donald Trump is expected to officially accept the party's nomination.

It indicates how the revenues (money received from the sale of products and services before expenses are taken out, also known as the “top line”) are transformed into the net income (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for, also known as “net profit” or the “bottom line”). It displays the revenues recognized for a specific period, and the cost and expenses charged against these revenues, including write-offs (e.g., depreciation and amortization of various assets) and taxes. The purpose of the income statement is to show managers and investors whether the company made or lost money during the period being reported.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to remember about an income statement is that it represents a period of time like the cash flow statement. This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.<\/p>\n<p>Charitable organizations that are required to publish financial statements do not produce an income statement. Instead, they produce a similar statement that reflects funding sources compared against program expenses, administrative costs, and other operating commitments. This statement is commonly referred to as the statement of activities. Revenues and expenses are further categorized in the statement of activities by the donor restrictions on the funds received and expended.<\/p>\n<p>The income statement can be prepared in one of two methods. The Single Step income statement takes the simpler approach, totaling revenues and subtracting expenses to find the bottom line. The more complex Multi-Step income statement (as the name implies) takes several steps to find the bottom line, starting with the gross profit. It then calculates operating expenses and, when deducted from the gross profit, yields income from operations. Adding to income from operations is the difference of other revenues and other expenses. When combined with income from operations, this yields income before taxes. The final step is to deduct taxes, which finally produces the net income for the period measured.<\/p>","links":"","id":21968,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"earnings","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/earnings\/","name":"earnings","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:52:21.707067","item_count":3012,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","latest_item_date":"2016-12-21T21:31:27.460266","created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/49\/Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg\/512px-Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":269,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=21968","category":"Subvertical","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":318,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CjM","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PayPal\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/9870\/","local_url":"\/topic\/paypal\/","description":"<p><b>PayPal Holdings, Inc.<\/b> is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, modernists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern States for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 to 1865, when he was assassinated, and the most recent being George W. Bush, who served from 2001 to 2009. The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation. Once dominant in the Northeast and Midwest, the party's core support now comes from the South as well as conservative Catholics and evangelicals in the South and across the country.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th United States Congress, Republicans have their largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1928 election and a majority of seats in the Senate. The party also holds a majority of governorships and state legislatures. Specifically, 68 out of 98 partisan state legislative chambers have Republican majorities.<\/p>\n<p>According to CBS news, \"The Republican National Committee says the acronym \"GOP\" dates back to 1875, at which time it meant 'Gallant Old Party'.\"<\/p>","links":"","id":118,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"republican-party","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/republican-party\/","name":"Republican Party (United States)","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-26T19:02:34.696713","item_count":6723,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=118","latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T20:19:05.117092","created_on":"2011-05-16T22:35:03","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/44\/Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg\/512px-Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":672,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=118","category":"Subvertical","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":426,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Republican_Party_(United_States)"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":2,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/wapo.st\/2adsxxw","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":44,"data_type":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/post-politics\/wp\/2016\/07\/20\/peter-thiel-plans-to-make-history-as-first-gop-convention-speaker-to-announce-that-he-is-proud-to-be-gay\/?tid=sm_tw"},{"url_text":"Read more on yahoo.com","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DwKH","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"IKEA Canada now support PayPal payments on e-commerce site - Reuters","importance":2,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/900123\/","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/07\/19\/ikea-canada-now-support-paypal-payments-on","date_ap":"Jul 19, 2016, 11:41 AM GMT","id":900123,"tweet":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/ikea-canada-makes-ecommerce-more-110000108.html","push_content":"IKEA Canada now support PayPal payments on e-commerce site - Reuters","slug":"ikea-canada-now-support-paypal-payments-on","media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/19\/ikea-canada-now-support-paypal-payments-on","ping":null,"date":"2016-07-19T11:41:55.090944","data":null,"source":null,"status":"published","updated_date":"2016-07-19T11:41:55.544416","pushed":true,"sponsor":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on yahoo.com","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"yahoo.com","topics":[{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":186,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LL","ping_category":[],"latitude":56.954681,"placetype":"Country","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canada\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/693\/","local_url":"\/topic\/canada\/","description":"<p><b>Canada<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><span title=\"\/æ\/ short 'a' in 'bad'\">æ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; French: <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ka.na.dɑ]<\/span>) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest metropolis is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.<\/p>\n<p>Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French claims were made on the area, with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1537. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada.<\/p>\n<p>In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.<\/p>","links":"","id":693,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":-98.308968,"kind":"location","slug":"canada","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/canada\/","name":"Canada","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:26:08.883381","item_count":2459,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=693","latest_item_date":"2016-12-28T01:03:31.136558","created_on":"2011-05-17T01:00:22","woeid":23424775,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d9\/Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"cf4h4bm94m8e","image_height":256,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=693","category":"Country","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":187,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canada"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CjM","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PayPal\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/9870\/","local_url":"\/topic\/paypal\/","description":"<p><b>PayPal Holdings, Inc.<\/b> is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"daily_count":3,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"tech","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","name":"tech","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","item_count":13501,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","geohash":"","image_height":612,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","category":"Topic","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_current":37,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/yhoo.it\/29RWMuP","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Grace Banks","id":36,"username":"grace.banks","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/36\/","last_name":"Banks","email":"grace.banks@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Grace"},"whoas":8,"data_type":null,"url":"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/ikea-canada-makes-ecommerce-more-110000108.html"},{"url_text":"Read more on cnet.com","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dhzw","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"PayPal to shutter operations in Turkey over licensing hurdle - CNET","importance":2,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/845046\/","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/05\/31\/paypal-to-shutter-operations-in-turkey-over","date_ap":"May 31, 2016, 03:55 PM GMT","id":845046,"tweet":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/paypal-to-close-operations-in-turkey-over-licensing-hurdle\/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b&linkId=25031192","push_content":"PayPal to shutter operations in Turkey over licensing hurdle - CNET","slug":"paypal-to-shutter-operations-in-turkey-over","media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/05\/31\/paypal-to-shutter-operations-in-turkey-over","ping":null,"date":"2016-05-31T15:55:14.133458","data":null,"source":null,"status":"published","updated_date":"2016-05-31T15:55:18.389318","pushed":true,"sponsor":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on cnet.com","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"cnet.com","topics":[{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CjM","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"primary":true,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PayPal\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/9870\/","local_url":"\/topic\/paypal\/","description":"<p><b>PayPal Holdings, Inc.<\/b> is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.

Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location between Europe and Asia has retained its geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations, as well as Assyrians, Greeks, Thracians, Phrygians, Urartians and Armenians. After Alexander the Great's conquest, the area was Hellenized, a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks.<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period. The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century, especially during the reign (1520–1566) of Suleiman the Magnificent. The empire remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks such as the Great Turkish War (1683–99) and the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which aimed to modernise the Ottoman state, proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire.<\/p>\n<p>Suspended by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1878, the Ottoman constitution and parliament were restored with the Young Turk Revolution on 24 July 1908. Taking advantage of the chaos, Bulgaria formally declared its independence on 5 October 1908, and Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6 October 1908. The Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912) encouraged the Balkan League to declare the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), which caused the Ottoman Empire to lose the majority of its remaining territories in Europe and triggered the largest ethnic cleansing of Turks in the Balkan peninsula since the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), resulting in the mass migrations of Turks to Anatolia. The disappointment in these losses led to the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas, who decided to join the Central Powers of World War I (1914–1918) which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers. During the war, the Ottoman government committed ethnic cleansing or genocide against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.<\/p>\n<p>The Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922), initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues in Anatolia against the occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey's official language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by 84.5% of the population. According to polls, between 78.1% and 81.3% of the country's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks. Other ethnic groups include legally recognised (Armenians, Greeks, Jews) and unrecognised (Kurds, Circassians, Arabs, Albanians, Bosniaks, Georgians, etc.) minorities. Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group, making up approximately 13.4% to 18% or up to 25% of the population, based on polls and estimates. The vast majority of the population is nominally Sunni Muslim, with Alevis making up the largest religious minority.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is a charter member of the UN, an early member of NATO, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, applied for full EEC membership in 1987, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power.<\/p>","links":"","id":467,"daily_count":16,"active":true,"longitude":35.431702,"kind":"location","slug":"turkey","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/turkey\/","name":"Turkey","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:23:54.792028","item_count":4770,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=467","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","created_on":"2012-12-12T21:41:28","woeid":23424969,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b4\/Flag_of_Turkey.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"sycjwk0943wk","image_height":341,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=467","category":"Country","recent_count":4,"trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":4,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

In this way, they can utilise the easy accessibility and outreach capabilities the Internet affords, as thereby easily broadcast information throughout many different regions of the world simultaneously and cost-efficiently. <b>Outdoor media<\/b> transmit information via such media as AR advertising; billboards; blimps; flying billboards (signs in tow of airplanes); placards or kiosks placed inside and outside of buses, commercial buildings, shops, sports stadiums, subway cars, or trains; signs; or skywriting. <b>Print media<\/b> transmit information via physical objects, such as books, comics, magazines, newspapers, or pamphlets. <b>Event organizing<\/b> and <b>public speaking<\/b> can also be considered forms of mass media.<\/p>\n<p>The organizations that control these technologies, such as movie studios, publishing companies, and radio and television stations, are also known as the mass media.<\/p>","links":"","id":8719,"daily_count":2,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"media","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/media\/","name":"media","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:58:53.062721","item_count":4869,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=8719","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","created_on":"2012-05-01T16:06:44","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/77\/Crystal_radio_advertisement.png\/512px-Crystal_radio_advertisement.png","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":309,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","category":"Subvertical","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_current":81,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_media"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Zux","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nick_Denton\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99001\/","local_url":"\/topic\/nick-denton\/","description":"<p><b>Nick Denton<\/b> (born 24 August 1966) is a British Internet entrepreneur, journalist and blogger, the founder and former proprietor of the blog collective Gawker Media, and the managing editor of the New York-based Gawker.com, until a lawsuit by Hulk Hogan bankrupted the company.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","links":"","id":2731,"daily_count":6,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"donald-trump","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donald-trump\/","name":"Donald Trump","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-11T15:02:08.249596","item_count":4875,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","created_on":"2010-09-09T20:31:06","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":683,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2731","category":"Person","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_current":0,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":61,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"daily_count":27,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"vertical","slug":"politics","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","name":"politics","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","item_count":96331,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","twitter_username":"breakingpol","geohash":"","image_height":503,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","category":"Topic","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_current":2,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/on.recode.net\/1TyY8qC","note":null,"type":"text","author":{"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","id":29,"username":"rebecca.bratek","is_staff":false,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","first_name":"Rebecca"},"whoas":38,"data_type":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.recode.net\/2016\/5\/9\/11647252\/venture-capitalist-peter-thiel-shows-up-on-a-list-of-trump-delegates"},{"url_text":"End of alert","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dao9","longitude":null,"latitude":null,"content":"PayPal reports earnings of 37 cents a share vs estimates of 35 cents; revenues of $2.54 billion vs estimates of $2.50 billion - CNBC","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/817469\/","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/04\/27\/paypal-reports-earnings-of-37-cents-a-share-vs-est","date_ap":"Apr 27, 2016, 08:13 PM GMT","id":817469,"tweet":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/04\/27\/paypal-reports-earnings-of-37-cents-a-share-vs-est","push_content":"PayPal reports earnings of 37 cents a share vs estimates of 35 cents; revenues of $2.54 billion vs estimates of $2.50 billion - CNBC","slug":"paypal-reports-earnings-of-37-cents-a-share-vs-est","media":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/04\/27\/paypal-reports-earnings-of-37-cents-a-share-vs-est","ping":null,"date":"2016-04-27T20:13:06.222074","data":null,"source":null,"status":"published","updated_date":"2016-04-27T20:13:11.318968","pushed":true,"sponsor":null,"url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"breakingnews.com","topics":[{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":321,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FsU","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/21968\/","local_url":"\/topic\/earnings\/","description":"<p>An <b>income statement<\/b> (US English) or <b>profit and loss account<\/b> (UK English) (also referred to as a <i><b>profit and loss statement<\/b><\/i> (P&amp;L), <i><b>statement of profit or loss<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>revenue statement<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>statement of financial performance<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>earnings statement<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>operating statement<\/b><\/i>, or <i><b>statement of operations<\/b><\/i>) is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company’s revenues and expenses during a particular period. It indicates how the revenues (money received from the sale of products and services before expenses are taken out, also known as the “top line”) are transformed into the net income (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for, also known as “net profit” or the “bottom line”). It displays the revenues recognized for a specific period, and the cost and expenses charged against these revenues, including write-offs (e.g., depreciation and amortization of various assets) and taxes. The purpose of the income statement is to show managers and investors whether the company made or lost money during the period being reported.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to remember about an income statement is that it represents a period of time like the cash flow statement. This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.<\/p>\n<p>Charitable organizations that are required to publish financial statements do not produce an income statement. Instead, they produce a similar statement that reflects funding sources compared against program expenses, administrative costs, and other operating commitments. This statement is commonly referred to as the statement of activities. Revenues and expenses are further categorized in the statement of activities by the donor restrictions on the funds received and expended.<\/p>\n<p>The income statement can be prepared in one of two methods. The Single Step income statement takes the simpler approach, totaling revenues and subtracting expenses to find the bottom line. The more complex Multi-Step income statement (as the name implies) takes several steps to find the bottom line, starting with the gross profit. It then calculates operating expenses and, when deducted from the gross profit, yields income from operations. Adding to income from operations is the difference of other revenues and other expenses. When combined with income from operations, this yields income before taxes. The final step is to deduct taxes, which finally produces the net income for the period measured.<\/p>","links":"","id":21968,"daily_count":0,"active":true,"longitude":null,"kind":"tag","slug":"earnings","livevideo":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/earnings\/","name":"earnings","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:52:21.707067","item_count":3012,"facebookchat":"","image_width":512,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","latest_item_date":"2016-12-21T21:31:27.460266","created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","woeid":null,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/49\/Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg\/512px-Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg","twitter_username":null,"geohash":"","image_height":269,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=21968","category":"Subvertical","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_current":318,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement"},{"muted_by_default":false,"trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CjM","ping_category":[],"latitude":null,"placetype":"","visible":true,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PayPal\">Wikipedia<\/a>","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/9870\/","local_url":"\/topic\/paypal\/","description":"<p><b>PayPal Holdings, Inc.<\/b> is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system that supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class.
