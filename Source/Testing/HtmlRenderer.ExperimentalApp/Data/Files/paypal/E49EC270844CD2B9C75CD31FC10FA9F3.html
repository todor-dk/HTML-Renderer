			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			
			<p>We know that financial terms can sometimes be confusing, so we've created some frequently asked questions to help explain things.</p>
			<p>Of course, if you still have any questions, please <a href="mailto:prepaid@paypal.com">contact us</a>.</p>

			<h4 class="infoAccordion faq"><a id="accordionfaq1" class="fold" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleAccordion('accordionfaq1','faq1'); trackPageAccordionEvent('faq1'); return false;"><span class="faq_question">Q.</span> How do I get a PayPal Prepaid MasterCard<sup>&reg;</sup>?</a></h4>
			<div id="faq1" class="infoAccordion">
				<p><span class="faq_answer">A.</span> There is one way to get a PayPal Prepaid Card.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Visit a retail location to purchase a temporary PayPal Prepaid Card.</strong> There's no credit check and you will be able to load money to the card when you buy it, but the card will need to be activated and your identity verified in order to: a) receive a personalized card; b) add more money to the card account; and c) access more of the card's features, such as direct deposit. If you do not activate the temporary card within 120 days of its purchase, it will expire and become unusable. See below for more information about where the card can be purchased and what it means for you if your temporary card is not activated and it expires.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

			<h4 class="infoAccordion faq"><a id="accordionfaq2" class="fold" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleAccordion('accordionfaq2','faq2'); trackPageAccordionEvent('faq2'); return false;"><span class="faq_question">Q.</span> How much does it cost to get a PayPal Prepaid MasterCard<sup>&reg;</sup>?</a></h4>
			<div id="faq2" class="infoAccordion">
				<p><span class="faq_answer">A.</span> There is a cost to purchase the temporary card at a retail location and the price depends on the retail location. You will also need to add funds at the time you purchase the card. The card purchase price depends on the retail location. Depending on which retail location you visit, the minimum initial load value will be either $10 or $20. The maximum initial load value will be $500.</p>
				<p>Upon purchasing the card, you will be automatically enrolled in the $4.95 per month fee plan which lets you make unlimited purchase transactions (subject to funds availability). The first Plan Fee will be deducted from your Card Account within 36 hours of purchase. To view this monthly fee, and the other costs associated with using the card, see the "Fees Related to the Service" section of the PayPal Prepaid Card Cardholder Agreement.</p>

			<div id="faq4" class="infoAccordion">

The primary cardholder must be the parent or legal guardian of the minor.  The minor must be at least 13 years of age. To request up to two secondary cards for eligible minor(s) or other household members or trusted friends, contact PayPal Prepaid Card Customer Service at (866) 753-6440. </p>
				<p>When the cardholder requests the addition of the secondary cardholder(s) to the PayPal Prepaid Card account, the Customer Service representative will need to know each secondary cardholder's name, physical street address (no P.O. Boxes), date of birth, and SSN. In addition, a copy of each minor's Social Security card and birth certificate will be required.</p>

			<div id="faq47" class="infoAccordion">
				<p><span class="faq_answer">A.</span> Gas stations, hotels, and car rental agencies frequently preauthorize a transaction, which means the business places a hold on your card until it knows the final amount you owe. Here are some common situations where such a hold will occur:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Using a PayPal Prepaid Card to pay for gasoline at the pump:</strong> Let's say you fill your gas tank with $35.00 worth of gas. The gas station will place a hold on your card account for up to $100 or more. Three days later, the gas station will tell us (that is, settle the transaction) the actual dollar value of the amount you spent. That means the additional funds (in this example, $65 or more) that were subject to the hold will be released back to the card, thus making those funds available to you.<br /><br />
					You can avoid the hold by taking your card to the gas station cashier and indicate either a specific amount of fuel, or the specific dollar value you wish to spend
					</li>
					<li><strong>Using a PayPal Prepaid Card to pay for a car rental:</strong> The PayPal Prepaid Card may be used at car rental agencies that accept prepaid cards. However, the rental agency will usually require a deposit of up to 20% or more than the cost of renting the vehicle. The rental agency will place a hold on your card account for that amount of money. The hold could last for a couple of weeks, and also depends on how long the rental lasts. We suggest you call the rental agency to inquire about how much they require for a standard deposit when paying with a prepaid card and how long a typical hold for a prepaid card will last.</li>
					<li><strong>Using a PayPal Prepaid Card to pay for a hotel room:</strong> The PayPal Prepaid Card may be used at select hotels that accept prepaid cards. However, you should expect the hotel to place a hold on your card. The hold will cover the hotel room rate plus up to 20% or more of the cost of the room. The hold will be in place until the hotel settles the transaction, i.e., sometime after you check out of the hotel. A typical hold could be released the day you check out, or up to several weeks after check out occurs. We suggest you call the hotel to inquire about how much a typical hold will be if paying with a prepaid card, and how long a typical hold on a prepaid card will last.</li>

				<p><span class="faq_answer">A.</span> Your PayPal Prepaid Card must be linked with your PayPal Account to participate in this online-based program. Once your online Account Center is up and running, your participation in the program is automatically activated. The more ways you use your card, the more money-saving offers we send to you, giving you more ways to earn more cash back rewards.</p>
				<p>Redeem the offers we send to you and you also get cash back on select purchases. The cash back credits will appear in your card account no later than the last day of the calendar month following the calendar month during which you redeemed the offer.  For example, rewards you earn from offers used in January will be credited in one lump sum by the end of February.</p>
