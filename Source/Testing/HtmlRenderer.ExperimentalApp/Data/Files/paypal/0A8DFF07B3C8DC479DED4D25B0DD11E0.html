            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>*IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW CARD ACCOUNT:</strong> To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card Account. <strong>What this means for you:</strong> When you open a Card Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your driver's license or other identifying documents.</p>
                <p>In accordance with federal regulations, until it is activated and registered, a prepaid card is subject to initial load limitations, may not be used for ATM use, international transactions, account-to-account transfers, or be reloaded. <strong>Residents of the State of Vermont are ineligible to open a Card Account.</strong> </p>
                <p><sup>1</sup>Other costs, terms, and conditions are associated with the use and reloading of this Card Account. For a detailed list of fees, see the <a href="https://www.paypal-prepaid.com/account/terms/010108_1-2.pdf" onclick="trackPageLinkEvent('Terms');" target="_blank">Cardholder Agreement</a>.</p>
                <p><sup>2</sup>Use of this Card requires a PayPal Account. If you do not already have a PayPal Account you will link to this Card, visit <a href="http://www.paypal.com" onclick="return speedbump();" target="_blank">www.paypal.com</a> to get one - or, get one when you activate this Card online. You will not be able to go online to access balance information, your transaction history, Instant Transfers, the mobile app, and the optional savings account unless you  link a PayPal Account to this Card. </p>
                <p><sup>3</sup>A fee may be assessed by reload location and may vary from location to location.</p>
                <p><sup>4</sup>Faster access to funds is based on comparison of NetSpend's immediate availability policy versus the typical banking practice of only posting funds after settlement. Direct Deposit and earlier availability of funds are subject to payor's support of this feature and timing of payor's funding. Check with your payor to find out when the direct deposit of funds will start.</p>
                <p><sup>5</sup>Money transfers may only be made in the name of a valid PayPal Prepaid Cardholder and your PayPal Prepaid Card must be activated and linked with your PayPal Account at www.paypal.com. Only one (1) PayPal Prepaid Card may be linked to one (1) PayPal Account. If a member of your household has another PayPal Prepaid Account, another PayPal Account in that person's name is needed. Transfers from the PayPal Account to the PayPal Prepaid Card Account are limited to the amount of funds available in your PayPal Account and may not exceed $300 a day/$2,000 per rolling 30 days. Overdrafts are not available. Money cannot be moved directly from individual funding sources like credit or debit cards, bank accounts, etc., attached to the PayPal Account to the PayPal Prepaid Card Account. Transfers from the PayPal Account to the PayPal Prepaid Card Account cannot be reversed or canceled. The Bancorp Bank and MasterCard are not affiliated with, and neither endorse nor sponsor the PayPal.com online account to which various funding sources, including a PayPal Prepaid Card, may be linked. </p>
                <p><sup>6</sup>By activating and using a PayPal Prepaid MasterCard, your participation in the rewards program is automatically activated. However, you may opt-out of the program at any time by visiting the Rewards Summary Page in your Online Account Center at www.paypal.com/prepaid. The reward offers we choose and send to you are based on your shopping habits.  We will not share any personal information about you with the merchants who sponsor offers.  When you activate an offer and make a purchase with the card, the merchant will not know you are a rewards program customer, but you will become their customer. For more details about how and when you get rewarded, see the program FAQs, terms and conditions in your Online Account Center. Cash back rewards are credited to your Card Account and are not available in the form of a check or other direct payment method.  Program sponsor: NetSpend Corporation. The Bancorp Bank and PayPal are not affiliated in any way with the program and neither endorse nor sponsor it.</p>
                <p><sup>7</sup>The Savings Account is made available to Cardholders through The Bancorp Bank; Member FDIC. To participate in the Savings Account program, Cardholder must consent to and continue receiving communications from us in electronic form. If Cardholder is subject to Internal Revenue Service backup withholding at the time of the request to open a Savings Account, the request will be declined. Interest is calculated on the Average Daily Balance(s) of the Savings Account and is paid quarterly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the Average Daily Balance is $1,000.00 or less, the interest rate paid on the entire balance will be 4.91&#37; with an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 5.00&#37;.</li>
                    <li>If the Average Daily Balance is more than $1,000.00, the interest rate paid on the portion of the Average Daily Balance which exceeds $1,000.00 will be 0.49&#37; with an APY of 0.50&#37;, and the interest paid on the portion of the Average Daily Balance which is $1,000.00 or less will be 4.91&#37;. The APY for this tier will range from 5.00&#37; to 0.54&#37;, depending on the balance in the account.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The interest rates and APYs of each tier may change. The APYs were accurate as of <script> var monthNames = [ "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December" ]; var now = new Date(), theYear = now.getYear()<1900?now.getYear()+1900:now.getYear();theMonth=monthNames[now.getMonth()], balanceDate = theMonth + " 1, " + theYear; document.write(balanceDate);</script>. These are promotional rates and may change without notice pursuant to applicable law. No minimum balance necessary to open Savings Account or obtain the yield(s). Because Savings Account funds are withdrawn through the Card Account (maximum 6 such transfers per calendar month), Card Account transaction fees could reduce the interest earned on the Savings Account. Card Account and Savings Account funds are FDIC-insured through The Bancorp Bank, Member FDIC upon verification of Cardholder’s identity. For purposes of FDIC coverage limit, all funds held on deposit by the Cardholder at The Bancorp Bank, will be aggregated up to the coverage limit, currently $250,000.00.</p>
                <p><sup>8</sup>A Cardholder may receive an unlimited number of Refer-a-Friend rewards while program is available. No     rewards credited to either party if referred individual had a PayPal Prepaid Card or any other NetSpend Prepaid     Card that was used for a value load, purchase, cash withdrawal, or incurred a Balance Inquiry Fee at any time   during the 180 calendar days before the day the $10 load requirement is fully met. Allow 2 business days for $5 credit  to appear on each Card Account. If a cardholder accrues $600 or more in Refer-a-Friend rewards in a calendar    year, NetSpend will mail cardholder an IRS Form 1099-MISC reflecting the total Refer-a-Friend rewards for such  calendar year. Cardholder acknowledges that by referring a friend through this program, cardholder is releasing     non-public information. Referred person acknowledges that payment of the referral may result in the     cardholder's knowledge of referred person establishing an account with us. The Bancorp Bank and PayPal are  not affiliated in any way with the Refer-a-Friend rewards program and do not endorse or sponsor the program.</p>
                <p><sup>9</sup>No charge for this service, but your wireless carrier may charge for messages or data.</p>
