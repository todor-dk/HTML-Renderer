He looks like a great listener. And he, like us, really enjoys watching videos of baby animals.\n    My new friend and I enjoy watching videos of baby gorillas! 😍😍😍🦍 #mylifeiscomplete #hereallylovedthisyall A post shared by Lindsey Costello (@lindseyncostello) on Jun 29, 2017 at 7:51pm PDT\nLindsey Costello visited the zoo's gorilla enclosure on June 30. She sat side-by-side with the great ape and held her smartphone up to the glass while playing videos of baby gorillas. (She gave permission to share her Instagram post via Storyful.)\nSEE ALSO: Listen up everyone, this new, beautiful gorilla meme has something to say\nA spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo confirmed the gorilla in Costello's photo was Jelani. \nThe 20-year-old silverback became internet famous in September 2015 after a clip of him watching YouTube videos of gorillas (meta!) went viral on YouTube. That video has since racked up more than 14 million views.\n\nJenali \"is a laid-back individual and likes to look at cellphone photos and videos,\" according to the zoo. When he's not staring at screens, he's probably chilling with Bengati, one of three other silverbacks in Louisville. \nIn the wild, however, silverbacks and other types of gorillas have a much less relaxed life. Western gorillas like Jelani, as well as Eastern gorilla species, are all endangered due to illegal hunting and habitat destruction. \nErr, sorry, back to your happy place now. \nWATCH: Watch this gorilla dance like it's nobody's business"},"shares":{"facebook":1437,"twitter":471,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":13,"total":1937},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5rruv8WvrWu1no51abJWQvL88dY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525440%2Fcd3e33a5-3218-423e-8a97-36ef5578ef83.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qWS5j37mJffEsaulp6iW9xV7w5g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3esn4Gmcw6vy5CPLYAZM_RkNiU4=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/98ZykmbyKKRZnbqqNsO0u-sx_kQ=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tFlvh0","display_title":"This chill gorilla loves baby animal videos like the rest of us","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"360O57ylV4","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Just two friends, hanging out.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/culture/","tweet_text":"This chill gorilla loves baby animal videos like the rest of us"},{"_id":"595d7499f11b2c594a000089","id":"2017/07/05/netflix-most-viewed-comscore","title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","title_tag":null,"author":"Adario Strange","post_date":"2017-07-05T23:21:17+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 05 Jul 2017 23:21:17 +0000","formatted_date":"07/05/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1DsUVQ","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/netflix-most-viewed-comscore/","content":{"plain":"When it comes to streaming video on your TV, Netflix is king.  \nThat's the finding from a recent comScore report on over-the-top (OTT) content, which says that Netflix commands more viewing time than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \nSEE ALSO: Netflix rolls out new way to get you to watch more Netflix\nThe report goes on to reveal that the average U.S. Wi-Fi–enabled household streams an average of one hour and 40 minutes of Netflix content directly to their television on a daily basis. Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nzN0MIFQA29tujOYUHWPr06Lcho=/280x158/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"280x158#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Fpc7Esvdh2CdKszA1by1AwEyV78=/560x316/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x316#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

At least in the case of Prince it does. \nSix of The Purple One's music videos appeared on an official YouTube channel over the last 24 hours, directly countering a stance he took on the digital distribution of his music when he was alive.  \nSEE ALSO: Prince's secret energy investment could help solar startups under Trump\nHits including \"When Doves Cry,\" \"Baby I'm A Star,\" \"I Would Die 4 U,\" and \"Let's Go Crazy\" now appear in music video form on the site. None of the videos -- which include tracks from Purple Rain (the movie) and three live performances of songs from the same album -- are available in high-definition formats.  \n\nPrince famously sued YouTube a decade ago to remove unauthorized use of his music on the site, which was in keeping with his general view that the internet was not a friend to music artists. \n\"The internet's completely over,\" the artist said back in 2010. \"I don't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else. They won't pay me an advance for it, and then they get angry when they can't get it.\"\n\nIn addition to getting YouTube to remove about 2,000 videos featuring his music back in 2007, Prince policed most major internet and streaming services, which made finding any of his music online nearly impossible. \nThat policy cracked a bit in over time, with some of his music occasionally showing up on various services. However, in 2015 Prince once again demanded that his music be removed from all streaming services except Tidal. \n\nWell, that's all over now, as his estate has decided to put his music videos back on YouTube. \nThe appearance of the videos coincides with the release of the deluxe version of Purple Rain, which came to Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon on June 23. \nWATCH: That time Matt Damon tried to make small talk with Prince"},"shares":{"facebook":161,"google_plus":9,"linked_in":6,"twitter":274,"total":450},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Q-MSDb7hJSIxU7tmlWAJ2aXoZRk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530116%2F6341189c-997e-485d-a60d-685055bf4a7f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/btpW1CQeSm0k0fMXsqAT312dwKI=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zZEK7zjONVj5xing2m_BnuM_HbQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xiazqm-QKxvMM8VawliSoScj1uM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bU928Ac-O6reS1teM7WWYfes9CM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9Ctrh8NW74NoeiX9UgdX3r9H0ok=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sRMcic","display_title":"Prince, who said the 'internet is over,' finally gets his own YouTube channel","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"PMboWXA08e","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Sign o' the times....","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Prince, who said the 'internet is over,' finally gets his own YouTube channel"},{"_id":"595f591a28cc3667b00008a7","id":"2017/07/07/hi-im-steve-surreal-viral-animation","title":"Gloriously random animation about a man named Steve is going viral","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-07-07T09:49:13+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 09:49:13 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"803","sort_key":"1DtqO5","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/hi-im-steve-surreal-viral-animation/","content":{"plain":"There are many different things that can capture the internet's heart.\nMaybe it's a tiny dog attempting to pedal a bike.

video on your TV, Netflix is king.  \nThat's the finding from a recent comScore report on over-the-top (OTT) content, which says that Netflix commands more viewing time than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \nSEE ALSO: Netflix rolls out new way to get you to watch more Netflix\nThe report goes on to reveal that the average U.S. Wi-Fi–enabled household streams an average of one hour and 40 minutes of Netflix content directly to their television on a daily basis. Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSjWqWkDINnhkXvQrnUvsNO8sTo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XKJTawuolV38Rzjm2JwfV9Fbybk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VaD72qGLTHS1EWmv_eqk_xqSiHs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q1Vb6EZBWpyB4tt3e1iKYIjIl_o=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

He looks like a great listener. And he, like us, really enjoys watching videos of baby animals.\n    My new friend and I enjoy watching videos of baby gorillas! 😍😍😍🦍 #mylifeiscomplete #hereallylovedthisyall A post shared by Lindsey Costello (@lindseyncostello) on Jun 29, 2017 at 7:51pm PDT\nLindsey Costello visited the zoo's gorilla enclosure on June 30. She sat side-by-side with the great ape and held her smartphone up to the glass while playing videos of baby gorillas. (She gave permission to share her Instagram post via Storyful.)\nSEE ALSO: Listen up everyone, this new, beautiful gorilla meme has something to say\nA spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo confirmed the gorilla in Costello's photo was Jelani. \nThe 20-year-old silverback became internet famous in September 2015 after a clip of him watching YouTube videos of gorillas (meta!) went viral on YouTube. That video has since racked up more than 14 million views.\n\nJenali \"is a laid-back individual and likes to look at cellphone photos and videos,\" according to the zoo. When he's not staring at screens, he's probably chilling with Bengati, one of three other silverbacks in Louisville. \nIn the wild, however, silverbacks and other types of gorillas have a much less relaxed life. Western gorillas like Jelani, as well as Eastern gorilla species, are all endangered due to illegal hunting and habitat destruction. \nErr, sorry, back to your happy place now. \nWATCH: Watch this gorilla dance like it's nobody's business"},"shares":{"facebook":1437,"twitter":471,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":13,"total":1937},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5rruv8WvrWu1no51abJWQvL88dY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525440%2Fcd3e33a5-3218-423e-8a97-36ef5578ef83.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qWS5j37mJffEsaulp6iW9xV7w5g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RRzWoOKH33_0RPvOfMqrIuSPLJs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ark5pHFAkT4ieFGjRS_CAs3abT4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6l4QCXPn3iQySNrQb2kEhYdoye4=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/X_fuRTWqcgI5bSNytiXB3eD9Dxs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tFlvh0","display_title":"This chill gorilla loves baby animal videos like the rest of us","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"360O57ylV4","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Just two friends, hanging out.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/culture/","tweet_text":"This chill gorilla loves baby animal videos like the rest of us"},{"_id":"59569382f11b2c16380000e1","id":"2017/06/30/iphone-youtube-app-story","title":"Here's the tweetstorm tale of why Google pulled YouTube as a default app for the iPhone","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-06-30T18:07:08+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 18:07:08 +0000","formatted_date":"06/30/2017","formatted_shares":"832","sort_key":"1DrfLa","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/30/iphone-youtube-app-story/","content":{"plain":"When the iPhone launched 10 years ago, it came with YouTube as a default app on iOS 1.\nThe pairing of the Google-owned video platform and Apple wasn't as odd then as it might seem today — the first commercial version of Android didn't debut until 2008. \nBut that doesn't mean that the Apple/ Google collaboration was a happy marriage. The YouTube app was created by Apple with little input from the YouTube team, which limited the video viewing experience, much to the chagrin of iOS users resorting to their mobile browser to watch video content on the platform.  \nThat changed in 2012 with the introduction of iOS 6, which launched without the Apple-built YouTube app for the first time, after Google didn't renew its license. This allowed Google to bring its own fully realized version of YouTube to the App Store, but also meant that YouTube was no longer a default app on the phone.\nSEE ALSO: The deadly escalation of prank videos on YouTube\nAt the time, it wasn't exactly clear why the split happened. My colleague Chris Taylor, who hated the Apple video player, guessed it was the result of Apple distancing itself from its rival, as it was the same year Maps came as part of the OS, too. \nNow, almost five years later we have an inside look at what went down with the split. \nHunter Walk, a notable venture capitalist who was on the YouTube team back in the early days of the iPhone, shed a little more light on the story via tweetstorm, which was spotted by Business Insider. In the tweetstorm, Walk gives us some insight about exactly what went down.\nYou can read the whole story — according to Walk, at least — below:\nApple approached YouTube abt being default app on 1st iPhone.

Total immersion requires a complete sphere of video (\"360\"), but humans can only see roughly half of that experience at any given moment.\nThat's why YouTube announced VR180 a bit ago, the idea being if you cut the VR \"world\" in half, you can boost the quality of the experience significantly, and most of what you're getting rid of the user isn't seeing anyway.\nNow all the format needs is actual support, and that's underway. Lenovo announced it would be the first Google partner to debut a VR180 camera. The new Lenovo camera can fit in your pocket and is meant to be as user-friendly as a point-and-shoot.\nUnlike point-and-shoots, however, this camera will be made specifically for shooting VR. Besides creating VR videos, the camera will also shoot half-sphere still photos and even stream live in the VR180 format, which is obviously already supported by YouTube. The camera is even said to support stereoscopic view (if you view on a VR headset), meaning the footage will have actual depth and not look \"flat.\"\n\nSince Lenovo is marketing the new VR camera towards people who want to capture visual pleasantries in everyday life, not professionals, it's aiming to sell it for around the same amount as other point-and-shoot cameras. And should be just as easy to use.\nGoogle is also supposedly partnering with LG and Yi to make more VR180 cameras. Google says it's prioritizing compatibility for the format, so it can be viewed seamlessly across VR platforms like Cardboard, PlayStation VR, and Daydream.\nAs to when Lenovo's camera will actually get a formal unveiling its anyone's guess, but you can sign up for updates here.\nWATCH: This laptop bag will charge all your devices"},"shares":{"facebook":57,"twitter":275,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":23,"pinterest":1,"total":363},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DL7W9VOahJMAq5KF1lGeRSmu6cw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F523151%2F19848d6e-e624-417f-a20f-75454b4b2cd2.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/orvAnx0zR6up60YWKBDV2O7-bsY=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50193%2F962d24c7-19b4-4354-8b0c-de64ef617a91.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pGg6vIp64-q2L5x46GsdUVcobu0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50193%2F962d24c7-19b4-4354-8b0c-de64ef617a91.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/b703Mds7TQ0h0cVBHd56d5LTgA0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50193%2F962d24c7-19b4-4354-8b0c-de64ef617a91.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Tbv1DXaGhsJH-odb4MfGQuyKFms=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50193%2F962d24c7-19b4-4354-8b0c-de64ef617a91.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YPqwOxhVM9m7ux_kmpu7pLrkiOA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50193%2F962d24c7-19b4-4354-8b0c-de64ef617a91.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2use3Cb","display_title":"Lenovo is making a camera specifically for YouTube's VR180 format","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"6k01pBroVb","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Nor formats, new cameras.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Lenovo is making a camera specifically for YouTube's VR180 format"}],"page":1,"per_page":10,"total":6091}

Pitbull's \"On the Floor.\" \nYes, it was that long ago since Psy's now iconic imaginary horse dance was your go-to dance move.\n\nHowever, there might be some threat at the top by Luis Fonsi's \"Despacito.\" The video has already clocked up 2.483 billion views since its Jan. 12 upload date, and is the fifth most-viewed on the site. \nThe single will need to beat Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' \"Uptown Funk,\" which is 4th place at 2.55 billion views, and Bieber's Purpose: The Movement version of \"Sorry,\" currently 3rd at 2.635 billion views.\nYou can bet none of these tracks will have

stresses you out, there's perhaps no better escape than glimpsing upon an adorable animal friend.\nTake, for instance, this gorilla at the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky. \nHe's serene, calm, and content. He looks like a great listener. And he, like us, really enjoys watching videos of baby animals.\n    My new friend and I enjoy watching videos of baby gorillas! 😍😍😍🦍 #mylifeiscomplete #hereallylovedthisyall A post shared by Lindsey Costello (@lindseyncostello) on Jun 29, 2017 at 7:51pm PDT\nLindsey Costello visited the zoo's gorilla enclosure on June 30. She sat side-by-side with the great ape and held her smartphone up to the glass while playing videos of baby gorillas. (She gave permission to share her Instagram post via Storyful.)\nSEE ALSO: Listen up everyone, this new, beautiful gorilla meme has something to say\nA spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo confirmed the gorilla in Costello's photo was Jelani. \nThe 20-year-old silverback became internet famous in September 2015 after a clip of him watching YouTube videos of gorillas (meta!) went viral on YouTube.

Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSjWqWkDINnhkXvQrnUvsNO8sTo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XKJTawuolV38Rzjm2JwfV9Fbybk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VaD72qGLTHS1EWmv_eqk_xqSiHs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q1Vb6EZBWpyB4tt3e1iKYIjIl_o=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

None of the videos -- which include tracks from Purple Rain (the movie) and three live performances of songs from the same album -- are available in high-definition formats.  \n\nPrince famously sued YouTube a decade ago to remove unauthorized use of his music on the site, which was in keeping with his general view that the internet was not a friend to music artists. \n\"The internet's completely over,\" the artist said back in 2010. \"I don't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else. They won't pay me an advance for it, and then they get angry when they can't get it.\"\n\nIn addition to getting YouTube to remove about 2,000 videos featuring his music back in 2007, Prince policed most major internet and streaming services, which made finding any of his music online nearly impossible. \nThat policy cracked a bit in over time, with some of his music occasionally showing up on various services. However, in 2015 Prince once again demanded that his music be removed from all streaming services except Tidal. \n\nWell, that's all over now, as his estate has decided to put his music videos back on YouTube. \nThe appearance of the videos coincides with the release of the deluxe version of Purple Rain, which came to Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon on June 23. \nWATCH: That time Matt Damon tried to make small talk with Prince"},"shares":{"facebook":161,"google_plus":9,"linked_in":6,"twitter":274,"total":450},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Q-MSDb7hJSIxU7tmlWAJ2aXoZRk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F530116%2F6341189c-997e-485d-a60d-685055bf4a7f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/btpW1CQeSm0k0fMXsqAT312dwKI=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/zZEK7zjONVj5xing2m_BnuM_HbQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Xiazqm-QKxvMM8VawliSoScj1uM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bU928Ac-O6reS1teM7WWYfes9CM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9Ctrh8NW74NoeiX9UgdX3r9H0ok=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50857%2Fde742ff8-2533-47f8-b4f3-0e567cd3191f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sRMcic","display_title":"Prince, who said the 'internet is over,' finally gets his own YouTube channel","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"PMboWXA08e","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Sign o' the times....","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Prince, who said the 'internet is over,' finally gets his own YouTube channel"},{"_id":"595cf2ddf11b2c72ce002e36","id":"2017/07/05/youtuber-climbs-skyscraper-rooftopping","title":"YouTuber climbing a 95-floor building without equipment isn't for the faint of heart","title_tag":null,"author":"April Hautea","post_date":"2017-07-05T14:08:28+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 05 Jul 2017 14:08:28 +0000","formatted_date":"07/05/2017","formatted_shares":"321","sort_key":"1DsLWp","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/05/youtuber-climbs-skyscraper-rooftopping/","content":{"plain":"Do not try this at home.

video on your TV, Netflix is king.  \nThat's the finding from a recent comScore report on over-the-top (OTT) content, which says that Netflix commands more viewing time than Hulu, Amazon Video, and YouTube combined. \nSEE ALSO: Netflix rolls out new way to get you to watch more Netflix\nThe report goes on to reveal that the average U.S. Wi-Fi–enabled household streams an average of one hour and 40 minutes of Netflix content directly to their television on a daily basis. Ranking behind Netflix is YouTube, followed by Hulu, and then Amazon Video. (The report also reveals that Hulu boasts the most overall streaming hours per household, but notes that \"Netflix is the leader in penetration and total engagement.\")\nBut the dominance of Netflix is just the start, as OTT is growing monthly, now reaching roughly 54 percent of U.S. homes with Wi-Fi in the U.S., making it an official mainstream activity beyond the \"Netflix and chill\" memes and jokes on social media. \n\nThe study, released in June, measured 12,500 homes and over 150,000 devices throughout the United States.   \nAs you might expect, the study found that most binge-watching occurs during the weekend. But there's another data point in the study that should give traditional TV networks even more cause for concern -- timing. ComScore found that OTT viewers have the same primetime TV watching peak window as live TV: between 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. \nThat means the challenge for live TV isn't just about on-demand video versus live TV content. OTT is also carving its way into the live television's supposed saving grace: primetime appointment viewing of live events and programs. \nOh yeah, and now Twitter and Facebook are streaming live events, and creating original shows--just like Netflix. It's probably too early to call this the death knell of traditional, broadcast live TV, but it's sure starting to look that way. \nWATCH: How to become a YouTube star"},"shares":{"facebook":460,"linked_in":355,"twitter":410,"google_plus":15,"total":1240},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gZ0cD538DxCl2fRkvrmBRkQgaXI=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F527688%2F713d603a-b167-4f00-a92f-0ff831f5cd69.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjb56uEHMKoRCtgVcdRj6yFll8A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fSjWqWkDINnhkXvQrnUvsNO8sTo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XKJTawuolV38Rzjm2JwfV9Fbybk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VaD72qGLTHS1EWmv_eqk_xqSiHs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q1Vb6EZBWpyB4tt3e1iKYIjIl_o=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50620%2F48a954f4-994a-417b-bb64-313662f31b06.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tSChtb","display_title":"Netflix is totally destroying Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube in battle for screen time","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"83Y0NvQ0Gg","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Netflix is winning the OTT war―by a lot.

When he's not staring at screens, he's probably chilling with Bengati, one of three other silverbacks in Louisville. \nIn the wild, however, silverbacks and other types of gorillas have a much less relaxed life. Western gorillas like Jelani, as well as Eastern gorilla species, are all endangered due to illegal hunting and habitat destruction. \nErr, sorry, back to your happy place now. \nWATCH: Watch this gorilla dance like it's nobody's business"},"shares":{"facebook":1437,"twitter":471,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":13,"total":1937},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/5rruv8WvrWu1no51abJWQvL88dY=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F525440%2Fcd3e33a5-3218-423e-8a97-36ef5578ef83.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qWS5j37mJffEsaulp6iW9xV7w5g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RRzWoOKH33_0RPvOfMqrIuSPLJs=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ark5pHFAkT4ieFGjRS_CAs3abT4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6l4QCXPn3iQySNrQb2kEhYdoye4=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/X_fuRTWqcgI5bSNytiXB3eD9Dxs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50400%2F7b377cf1-0338-45b4-85fc-6c74cea3e6bb.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tFlvh0","display_title":"This chill gorilla loves baby animal videos like the rest of us","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"360O57ylV4","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Just two friends, hanging out.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Culture","channel_label":"Culture","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/culture/","tweet_text":"This chill gorilla loves baby animal videos like the rest of us"},{"_id":"59569382f11b2c16380000e1","id":"2017/06/30/iphone-youtube-app-story","title":"Here's the tweetstorm tale of why Google pulled YouTube as a default app for the iPhone","title_tag":null,"author":"Brett Williams","post_date":"2017-06-30T18:07:08+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 18:07:08 +0000","formatted_date":"06/30/2017","formatted_shares":"832","sort_key":"1DrfLa","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/30/iphone-youtube-app-story/","content":{"plain":"When the iPhone launched 10 years ago, it came with YouTube as a default app on iOS 1.\nThe pairing of the Google-owned video platform and Apple wasn't as odd then as it might seem today — the first commercial version of Android didn't debut until 2008. \nBut that doesn't mean that the Apple/ Google collaboration was a happy marriage. The YouTube app was created by Apple with little input from the YouTube team, which limited the video viewing experience, much to the chagrin of iOS users resorting to their mobile browser to watch video content on the platform.  \nThat changed in 2012 with the introduction of iOS 6, which launched without the Apple-built YouTube app for the first time, after Google didn't renew its license. This allowed Google to bring its own fully realized version of YouTube to the App Store, but also meant that YouTube was no longer a default app on the phone.\nSEE ALSO: The deadly escalation of prank videos on YouTube\nAt the time, it wasn't exactly clear why the split happened. My colleague Chris Taylor, who hated the Apple video player, guessed it was the result of Apple distancing itself from its rival, as it was the same year Maps came as part of the OS, too. \nNow, almost five years later we have an inside look at what went down with the split. \nHunter Walk, a notable venture capitalist who was on the YouTube team back in the early days of the iPhone, shed a little more light on the story via tweetstorm, which was spotted by Business Insider. In the tweetstorm, Walk gives us some insight about exactly what went down.\nYou can read the whole story — according to Walk, at least — below:\nApple approached YouTube abt being default app on 1st iPhone. Making it happen ensured the \"YouTube of mobile\" was YouTube itself....— Hunter Walk (@hunterwalk) June 30, 2017\n\n...YouTube was still operating pretty independently frm GOOG at that time, & our BD team did great job managing Apple & Google interests...— Hunter Walk (@hunterwalk) June 30, 2017\n\n...was actually API deal w some add'l language around functionality, bec Apple built the app itself. They wanted that control...— Hunter Walk (@hunterwalk) June 30, 2017\n\n...i hated the shitty old TV icon they chose but i guess no way they were gonna put the YT logo :) ...

She slept on friends' couches and ate their food as she worked to get an agent and learn the ins and out of the industry. She ended up landing the first commercial she auditioned for. \n\"I was like, 'Oh, this is easy,'\" Clery said with a laugh.\nThirteen years later, she's still laughing. Her career has never been better, but that's not because she's been in movies or in a recurring role on television. \nShe's a Facebook star. \nFor almost the last decade, if you wanted to start as an online video creator and perhaps one day make it on stage or on TV, you went to YouTube. The video platform became a bustling marketplace for a wide range of people looking creating everything from makeup tutorials to comedy skits. \nYouTube's community grew so big that it eventually inspired VidCon, an annual conference for online video, held in Anaheim, California this week. There's a lot going on at VidCon, but it all centers around one thing—YouTube. It's one of the few places where Facebook feels like a sideshow.\nThis year, Facebook is looking to change that. The social network is in the midst of making a push to be the new go-to network for creators. And they have a pretty good pitch. Facebook has a wealth of tools, like Facebook Live, Messenger, and Instagram. There's also a growing pool of money for creators to tap via sponsorships and mid-roll ads. \nBut Facebook's big advantage comes down to one big thing: Its captive audience of almost 2 billion people.\n\"My mission is to make millions of people laugh around the world on a consistent basis. Every day that’s the intention I set. Facebook has allowed me to do that in a way that no other platform has because the reach is just so incredible to me,\" Clery said. \nStarting out \nYouTube was built to be a video platform; Facebook has grown into the role. \nUp until a few years ago, Facebook hardly had any video, while YouTube had already emerged as the internet's main video destination. That has changed, slowly but diligently. Facebook now has all the features necessary to cater to video sharing—including the money necessary to make it worthwhile for individuals.\nThe digital creative class took notice. Whispers began spreading among the creator community about Facebook's offerings.\nClery didn't start out on Facebook. She tried Vine, but didn't feel like she fit in. Instagram's 15-second limit didn't seem to work for her either. YouTube was barely an option—the platform was already home to thousands of creators jockeying for attention.\nSo, she began to try Facebook. Clery began posting comedy videos on her personal page, but soon enough realized she could make a branded Page—and much more.\n\"A bit after that Facebook started doing video, and people were like, 'That’s the new thing! You can put a whole minute on there,'\" she said. \"I would be doing collabs with other comedians, Instagram comedians, and they were all talking about you have to get your shit on Facebook.\" \nIronically enough, making fun of \"Instagram models\" became her first viral video on Facebook, where she played a character called Ivy, modeling after people she actually saw trying to make it big on Instagram. \n\nThat 16-second video spread, and within the next year, Clery had gained about 1 million \"likes\" on her Facebook Page. Now, she's up to more than 3 million. \nAs to the virality of videos, it depends. Some videos in her series \"Me Trying to Flirts\" have more than 10 million video views, where a view on Facebook is only three seconds.\nWhile a view may only be three seconds, when you peel back those vanity metrics, creators on Facebook are seeing their viewers consume significantly more content than brands and even other publishers. Take Drew Binsky, a foreign-language teacher turned world traveler who gained fame as a travel blogger and first got big on Snapchat. \nBinsky's videos on Facebook are seen on average for 25 seconds, higher than the 17 seconds Facebook recently accounted as the average watch time for videos. \nMany of Binsky's videos are watched for much longer than that. His most successful Facebook video to date has more than 6.5 million unique viewers, with an average watch time of 55 seconds for a total of 14 million minutes consumed, without paid promotion, according to viewership data provided by Delmondo. \n\"It's really hard to get a viral video on YouTube, if you don’t have a following already. If I make good content [on Facebook] people are going to want to share it,\" Binsky said. \"I've only made 25 videos since January, and I have over 14 million minutes.\" \nSuccess on Facebook comes with a catch. While Clery and Binksy might have millions of \"likes\" on their pages, reaching them isn't that simple—they're still at the mercy of the algorithm that controls what users see on Facebook's News Feed.\nThat means creators face ups and downs that they can't do much to control.\n\"I notice some weeks are fire, just one viral video after another and you’re unstoppable and it’s like every day,\" Clery said. \"And then two weeks later it’s like flop, another flop or just lower engagement.\"\nClery said she looks at her data, via Facebook Page insights, but she doesn't \"antagonize or become obsessed with it.\"\nBut Facebook does, in part. The more money these creators make, the more money goes into Facebook's bank, as well. The tech giant is trying to grow its platform to compete more with YouTube and other video-heavy competitors by inking deals with media outlets and older networks to create exclusive shows for Facebook. High-quality video is where the ad dollars are, $70 billion of which is trapped in traditional television.\nFacebook declined to say how many creators are in their paid program or in conversation with their partnerships team. \nMaking fans... and money\nUnlike many in Hollywood, Clery isn't complaining about making money, at least not now.\nHer first year on Facebook she was living off of her savings, and it took awhile before her first brand deal on Instagram and later Facebook. \nNow, she's part of Facebook's exclusive monetization program, where a handful of creators and publishers are able to add mid-roll ads onto live videos. \n\"I'm making more money than I ever made as an actress,\" Clery said.\nClery is in the inner circle of Facebook creators, a nascent community, whereby the Facebook partnerships team invited her to Menlo Park this week, prior to VidCon, to meet with engineers and product managers to discuss potential updates.\n“Creators are the masters of building and growing a global community from scratch,\" said Daniel Danker, Facebook's director of product. \"We are continuing to build products to help creators express themselves, build an audience and support their businesses, and we’re excited about the future.\"\nIt's one thing for a Facebook executive to say that. It's quite another for creators to believe it.\nFacebook is now gaining a reputation in Hollywood that they care about the creators, something YouTube is best known for due to their Creator Space and big partnerships team. It's the polar opposite of Vine, whose demise may be partially blamed to how they refused to let creators through their office doors until it was far too late. \n\"[Facebook is] all about the artist at this point and they want us to have a successful business on the platform. They definitely listen, and I feel comfortable,\" Clery said.\nThat doesn't mean she, or any other creator, has a direct line to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Clery was disappointed when she learned she wasn't able to knock on Zuckerberg's door. He wasn't in town. \nAn advantage of Facebook, she said, is that creators can more easily connect with their fans. For example, Clery knows that 70 percent of her viewers are women and mostly ages 18 to 35. London is her most popular city.  \nBinksy's strategy is to join different Facebook Groups that focus on travel, for example, and share his videos there. He also responds to almost every comment. What he's noticed is that the comments are much friendlier on Facebook. While about 90 percent of the comments he sees on his videos on YouTube are negative, he said about 70 percent are positive on Facebook. \n\"On YouTube there are so many trolls,\" Binksy said. \nJourney to VidCon\nVidCon used to be all about YouTube. That's changing.\n\"I think it’s starting to matter less what platform you’re on but your reach. The platform is less important. What’s more important is what are these people influential about. How do they engage in their audience,\" said Matt Britton, CEO of Crowdtap, a marketing technology company.\nAudience is, for sure, what ad agencies are looking for, many of whom will be present at VidCon this week. Clery said she's taking a few meeting with agencies, between her scheduled panels with Facebook. \nWhile her Facebook audience is her largest, Clery, like any creator, is on other platforms like YouTube and Twitter. She's also a big fan of Snapchat, and unlike many other creators has had a meeting with them.  \n\"I can’t say that they have done nothing for me,\" Clery said. \"I asked them to have access to a filter and they were kind enough to let me have it.\"\nShe hasn't made a dime directly off of Snapchat, but Clery downloads her own Snapchat Stories and edits and repackages them for Facebook and YouTube, where she is able to making ad revenue. \n\nClery also isn't done with traditional TV networks. She recently wrapped up shooting a series for Comedy Central and is pitching another show to several other networks. While once upon a time, Clery wasn't the first pick, now she's ushered through the door as network execs ask her for help on creating social-first content. \nStill, she's primarily building her own content for her own fans, but it's a long road ahead. \n\"Even in the world of an influencer, the Facebook star is so new,\" Clery said. \"I tried to explain what I do to my aunt and my parents so many times, and they’re like, 'Yeah, but are you on TV or not?'

Can you feel it? I'm not talking about a new Star Wars trailer, but the OnePlus 5.\nThe OnePlus 5 is one of the most anticipated phones of the year. The startup's expected to blow the roof off this year and go all the way with its latest flagship. \nSEE ALSO: This might be the cutest and tiniest smartphone ever\nBut will the phone live up to all the hype and compete with Samsung's Galaxy S8, Google's Pixel and the iPhone 7? You'll have to watch the livestream to find out.\nFans, haters, or just curious cats can watch the livestream on OnePlus's website or YouTube (embedded below) starting at 12:00 p.m. ET.\n\nAlternatively, you the event will also be streamed on Facebook:\n\nSince OnePlus launched the OnePlus One in 2014, the company's been on a rocket ship into the stratosphere. \nIt followed the One with the OnePlus 2, OnePlus X, OnePlus 3, and then the OnePlus 3T. And now, the OnePlus 5 is expected to go above and beyond. \nWhile the company's teased a design that looks kinda like the iPhone 7 Plus, the processor (Qualcomm Snapdragon 835), and dual cameras, there's still a lot we don't know. Will it have a headphone jack? Will the screen finally get an upgrade? What about about battery life?\nA continuous hard edge, refined over 3 years. https://t.co/KVXBWmhBt8 pic.twitter.com/KBNppQ0R0U— OnePlus (@oneplus) June 8, 2017\n\nAll will be revealed during the stream, so sit back, get comfy, grab some popcorn, and get ready.
