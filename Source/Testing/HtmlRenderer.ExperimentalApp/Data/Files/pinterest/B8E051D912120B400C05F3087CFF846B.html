But finding those items to buy for yourself isn't so easy. And even when you can, an outfit that works perfectly in your mind sometimes turns out to be a disaster IRL.\nTechnology is giving us hope, however: Pinterest's new and improved fashion assistant, called Lens, is here to give us the Cher Clueless closet experience we've always wanted.  \nSEE ALSO: Prolong your clothes with this gentle washer that doesn't use electricity\nFirst introduced in February, Pinterest Lens is getting a major fashion upgrade. To access Lens, just tap the camera icon in the upper righthand corner. Then all you have to do is hit the circle in the middle of your screen to take a picture of anything in the real world -- a coat hanging in the corner, your coworker's shoes, or a purse in the new Kate Spade line -- and watch the results roll in.\nThe pre-existing Lens already identified types of clothing you might want and suggested new outfit ideas for you, but now it can dig much deeper into specific styles and recommendations. \nLens doesn't just stop at the fact that you want a new swimsuit or necklace. The technology can new get really specific: finding you a red, high-waisted one-piece with side cutouts or a chunky, turquoise statement necklace. After it's pinpointed the style you're after, Lens goes even further to suggest other items you should pair with the look. \n\nLens' capabilities aren't just limited to photos you take on the spot. You can use photos already on your phone for searches. As if that wasn't enough, Lenz also has recommended searches to help you discover new styles and get an idea for popular seasonal styles. Finally, Pinterest added Instant Ideas to Lens results, so you can quickly get ideas related to a specific result in just a tap. \n\nAs part of the upgrade, Pinterest has doubled the number of object categories the Lens technology can recognize. This means the app can recommend certain styles and pairings of shoes, shirts, hats, and more.\nLens is relatively new, and Pinterest hasn't shared any statistics on its popularity has gotten positive user feedback so far. With the upgrade, the world's fashion bloggers may get even more prolific.\nSerious tweet: @Pinterest's Lens feature is like Shazam for everything. REALLY COOL TECH. #SMWLA— Alexandra Benson (@alexandraeryn) June 15, 2017\n\n[summer style] with the @Pinterest lens // https://t.co/Dul3VzjRwD // #styleblogger // #inspo // #mysanfrancisco pic.twitter.com/nytWJv6UIc— Kathleen Ensign (@KatWalkSF) June 6, 2017\n\nDis is the coolest shit. \"Lens\" by @Pinterest. (That's my foot -- now I'm shopping for sandals). #smwla pic.twitter.com/U6bstXM6WT— Whitney Bonrud (@WhitneyBonrud) June 15, 2017\n\nCompetitors like Craves and ASAP54 are out there, but they're not as far-reaching and don't combine the same kind of style recommendations that Lens provides. \nPinterest recently raised over $12 billion of funding which it plans to use on more advanced computer vision and visual search technologies. So get used to visual assistants taking the stress out of everyday fashion decisions, sit back, and relax.\nWATCH: This store on wheels will let you shop on demand from the comfort of your curb\n "},"shares":{"twitter":299,"facebook":30,"linked_in":8,"google_plus":5,"pinterest":3,"total":345},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BtNbQ6plqNLDgwLss2-AKZ1TkKM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F514518%2F6bf9d578-a463-48c3-ba21-35ad253e90f9.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lBs-lXtgrlw-OpbvgKGnNQ_J0MA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49295%2F24a26a0f-d347-4211-9c03-1bc8b9a73dc4.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9B8O73xPvIQ4RfI1Rh5SUPAI6Og=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49295%2F24a26a0f-d347-4211-9c03-1bc8b9a73dc4.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/msXZdVFzEPkQ5uC4T_sp7QMu-Qs=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49295%2F24a26a0f-d347-4211-9c03-1bc8b9a73dc4.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GZu5cOjTes3upM5xlVrlJmc59Hs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49295%2F24a26a0f-d347-4211-9c03-1bc8b9a73dc4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B7kC7jajx6tmJeZUI7CtlPTbf4g=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49295%2F24a26a0f-d347-4211-9c03-1bc8b9a73dc4.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rD8QpS","display_title":"Pinterest is getting closer to giving us Cher's 'Clueless' closet","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"xglda98o76","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The perfect outfit in the blink of an eye.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Pinterest is getting closer to giving us Cher's 'Clueless' closet"},{"_id":"593706ed9111ae1ce800000f","id":"2017/06/06/pinterest-funding-round","title":"Pin This: Pinterest just scored $150 million in funding","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2017-06-06T19:47:57+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:47:57 +0000","formatted_date":"06/06/2017","formatted_shares":"772","sort_key":"1DiGTr","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/06/pinterest-funding-round/","content":{"plain":"Investors are—yes—pinning their hopes on Pinterest's continued success.\nThe scrapbook-like platform just raised $150 million from a group of existing backers at the same share price as its last funding round in 2015.\nThe cash infusion boosted the company's worth from around $11 billion to $12.3 billion.\nSEE ALSO: More autoplay ads are coming to Pinterest\nThe move confirms speculation that the company plans to delay an inevitable IPO as it continues to build out its ads business.\nDespite an aspirational ethos that easily lends itself to all sorts of marketing, Pinterest has mostly lagged when it comes to monetization. It only just started selling video ads last fall, and it only began offering ads at all in 2014.\nThe slow pace of ad product launches has reportedly frustrated some marketers who'd like to see the platform become more versatile. Still, analysts often cite Pinterest's social search engine as a potential challenger to Google's supremacy along with Amazon. And Pinterest has aimed to live up to that prediction, with a series of recent ad rollouts, including promoted posts and autoplay videos interspersed with search results.\nAll those new ad slots have apparently paid off. A spokesperson said revenue per search query has doubled since the beginning of the year.\nBut those changes are only the beginning of the company's lofty dreams for its search engine. Eventually, Pinterest wants to be widely seen as the natural starring place for all visual searches on the web. In doing so, it's trying to free its image from the \"social network\" pigeonhole --  \"Pinterest is really about yourself and not broadcasting to friends,\" its spokesperson told me.\nPinterest has also been bolstering the tech behind that search. Earlier this year, it rolled out a lens search feature that surfaces any posts resembling whatever you happen to be pointing your camera towards.  Pinterest claims it's the first time that's been done.\nThe company's said to be aiming for $500 million in revenue this year—up from $300 million last year. They also launched their first-ever out-of-home ad campaign on Tuesday with billboards in Times Square and across New York.\nThis story has been updated with information from Pinterest.\n\nWATCH: How to make your own fidget spinner"},"shares":{"linked_in":135,"twitter":235,"facebook":24,"google_plus":4,"pinterest":3,"stumble_upon":371,"total":772},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/abo2UffiCPJWHdMBZQJXHA8__Xo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F499734%2F645bfd4a-8a3d-47b8-a07d-114a48950735.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lybHL7y4CO36BBPfKzX_LKRHRn8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47911%2F5558e325-5643-4993-ac0e-87652a25c709.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/g8dVisW7UOGh3jQWU_mtH8kSXXM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47911%2F5558e325-5643-4993-ac0e-87652a25c709.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VFFxHuX1YbnxZYvpH671pH2p4o0=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47911%2F5558e325-5643-4993-ac0e-87652a25c709.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8FKFt-0KsyQlcpJzpvKVNCzF38k=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47911%2F5558e325-5643-4993-ac0e-87652a25c709.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XEgzQ6o085ttJM7eOEiQH62qBK0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47911%2F5558e325-5643-4993-ac0e-87652a25c709.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rxXqqa","display_title":"Pin This: Pinterest just scored $150 million in funding","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"1On85XglBv","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The company is valued at $12.3 billion.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Pin This: Pinterest just scored $150 million in funding"},{"_id":"5932052528cc361ed0000042","id":"2017/06/02/rip-delicious-bookmarking-site","title":"Link-saving site Delicious is dead.

Social bookmarking competitor Pinboard announced it acquired Delicious. By June 15, the old site will be in read-only mode, so users won't be able to save new bookmarks.\n\nBut before we completely forget about the social bookmarking pioneer that arrived in 2003 as del.icio.us, let's remember the good times it brought us all.\nanyone remember https://t.co/YK1iGjfUI0— David Kaczynski (@davidkaczyn) May 22, 2017\n\nDelicious was ahead of its time and led to so many favorites that survive to this day. Social bookmarking became a thing because of Delicious, which led the charge with tagging to organize online content. Its latest acquirer Pinboard didn't even come around until 2009. \nSites like StumbleUpon, Diigo and now Pinboard came about based on the Delicious concept and tagging system.\nDelicious tried switching things up, even toward the end, to encourage more users to use the tool, but as one of my Mashable colleagues noted, \"Nothing really stuck.\" \nAnd then the competition and newer technology trounced them. When the cloud made bookmarks saved on one browser easily accessible in another, users didn't need a separate service.\nPocket, first known as Read It Later when it came out in 2007, really swooped in and took most of Delicious' potential by focusing on mobile bookmarking instead of desktop. Pinterest also stole Delicious' thunder by taking saved links and turning them into beautiful pins with boards and a pretty interface.\nI think fondly of Delicious even though when I search for memories of Delicious in my inbox I'm reminded of the bumpy past few years. When the site was in transition, links didn't get saved or applets I'd set up on Zapier and IFTT were riddled with errors. The bookmarklet got super buggy and eventually I deleted it.\nsomething went wrong [https://t.co/yrth88fvzz]— IZIVA (@iziva) May 26, 2017\n\nIts sale to Pinboard is the fifth sale in the past decade and almost a half. First it was sold to Yahoo in 2005, then to the YouTube founders in 2011. In 2014 Science Inc. bought it and then it was managed by Delicious Media in 2016. It's final resting place was Pinboard, whose developer Maciej Cegłowski said in the announcement he bought Delicious \"so it wouldn’t disappear from the web.\"\nBut in its heyday, it was a web surfer's best tool. Power users and link savers everywhere should think fondly of this simple, yet web-shattering tool.\nDon't despair entirely. All your bookmarks can be migrated to the new owners over at Pinboard and bookmarking can continue on at the new service for $11 a year. \nRIP, Delicious.\nWATCH: Beachgoers should be wary of this deadly sea creature"},"shares":{"facebook":80,"google_plus":15,"pinterest":3,"linked_in":10,"twitter":403,"total":511},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rU6wG7CmXjijlcOTtOeH0iBoiZo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F495797%2Fe4e32fdf-8ab2-422a-838f-5fe5947fadf1.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2gbyYULsl77D4eNUgnUv982Io4g=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47491%2Fa50329cc-7812-4c74-b8d0-01b7df47b718.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1e88ByM--bgwTCmzvNVwzS8hpbA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47491%2Fa50329cc-7812-4c74-b8d0-01b7df47b718.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bc3DnM6--9oqY9yfoF0uTPGKcKo=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47491%2Fa50329cc-7812-4c74-b8d0-01b7df47b718.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bSVYojvZfNC1WUnfT5T6fhys3oA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47491%2Fa50329cc-7812-4c74-b8d0-01b7df47b718.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/I0O-xBKMxOHSaql87JssYGZr3j0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F47491%2Fa50329cc-7812-4c74-b8d0-01b7df47b718.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rB5Yge","display_title":"Link-saving site Delicious is dead.

Pinterest can help.\nEver since its inception, food has been a large and important category for Pinterest. Food is the most searched category on Pinterest, and most frequently marked as \"tried,\" a tag that indicates what DIY projects users actually tried out at home. ​Now Pinterest is introducing dedicated features to help pinners find recipes.\nSEE ALSO: This toddler is cooking up a delicious storm on her YouTube show\nUsing Lens, the company's visual search and image-recognition feature, Pinterest can now help you find recipes simply by taking photos of your food. Using \"dish recognition,\" Lens analyzes the photo you took to recognize what the dish might be and then suggest related recipes. \n\nPinterest has also enhanced search with food filters. You can filter by dietary preferences, time to prepare, and ingredients -- so you can search based on what you have in the fridge. To complete Pinterest's recipe app, the company has also added ratings and reviews similar to other popular recipe apps.\nWith so many people pinning recipes they're interested in, Pinterest arguably had great insight into upcoming food trends. Currently the company says the top pizza recipe is vegetarian, and Mimosas and whiskey are the top rising beverages.\n\nOver the last few years, Pinterest has been doubling down on being the go-to visual search tool, most recently with Lens. With Lens, Pinterest wants you to be able to take a photo of and then identify anything from clothing to furniture, and then be able to buy what you see. The company's tools are powerful, but not without competition. \nAt its developers conference earlier this month, Google launched launched a similar product, also called Lens, that can help add a layer of intelligence to whatever you point your smartphone camera at. Based on the demo, Google's focus is more about adding context to the outside world -- restaurants, street signs, and monuments -- while Pinterest's is more around everyday objects: clothes, food, and furniture.  \nWATCH: We tried to make cloud eggs and they were eggcellent"},"shares":{"twitter":338,"pinterest":3,"facebook":98,"linked_in":6,"google_plus":9,"total":454},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/rjdjbkLJk9c2nBnIhlslf_AISnk=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F484944%2Ffc958c75-2554-42f4-8204-e5661100071c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ATqYF0BXAf9Jr1yvPtLglH5mVLQ=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46494%2F9a6a0c10-ce26-40c7-a4d7-68174eb21856.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vWEFA9GL6EtXzmz8pXs8gj3Gvt4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46494%2F9a6a0c10-ce26-40c7-a4d7-68174eb21856.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wxQzSazaFSAW8kdeYT5zADn39fY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46494%2F9a6a0c10-ce26-40c7-a4d7-68174eb21856.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wAiQ0OMfobDnEWrpEeAOINTMtEE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46494%2F9a6a0c10-ce26-40c7-a4d7-68174eb21856.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wyH4E6SKVJNncVNUvnzEk-tTCh4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46494%2F9a6a0c10-ce26-40c7-a4d7-68174eb21856.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rdoNGX","display_title":"Pinterest is making food porn work for you","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"Mzv8ZVD0Qm","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Up your home cooking game.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Pinterest is making food porn work for you"},{"_id":"58f7beb128cc36375e000026","id":"2017/04/19/shower-plants-trend-pinterest","title":"'Shower plants' will give you the perfect Insta-worthy bathroom","title_tag":null,"author":"Samantha Scelzo","post_date":"2017-04-19T19:46:56+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 19:46:56 +0000","formatted_date":"04/19/2017","formatted_shares":"2.8k","sort_key":"1D1cpG","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/04/19/shower-plants-trend-pinterest/","content":{"plain":"What's the number one problem with trying to be a regular human and buying chic plants to keep in your home?

Love flowers? Or gadgets? Or food porn? Now you can save all those posts into their own folders, letting you obsess over them in the most left-brained way possible.\nSEE ALSO: Instagram just ruined Instagram\nIf that sounds just like Pinterest, congratulations, you've figured out Instagram's plan here: to take the primary features of other services and plug them into its app so you have less reason to spend time anywhere else. The main difference between Instagram collections and Pinterest is the former are private, so only you can see them.\nBlatant cloning aside, collections aren't a terrible idea.\nTo save a post into a board... er, collection, just tap and hold the bookmark icon beneath it. From there, you can save into an existing collection or a create a new one. To create a new collection for posts you've already saved, go to your profile, tap the bookmark tab, and then tap the \"+\" icon in the top-right corner. Now you can select posts to add to it.\nBlatant cloning aside, collections aren't a terrible idea. Lots of people look to Instagram influencers for inspiration on things like home decor, personal style, and even just silly memes. So why not offer them a way to better retain and organize the things they like? And if the influencers get more influential in the process, I'm sure they won't complain.\nInstagram says 46% of its users have saved at least one post since it introduced the feature in December 2016. That figure doesn't carry a lot of weight, though, since many of those people are likely saving once just to try out the feature, but never doing it again. However, there are no doubt more than a few \"power savers\" who will view collections as a godsend.\nSince the collections are private, there doesn't appear to be a monetization strategy apart from simply making it easier to save and come back to sponsored posts as well. That is, if you even still see those at all.\nWATCH: We need to talk about Luke's last words in the 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' trailer"},"shares":{"facebook":2513,"google_plus":25,"twitter":757,"linked_in":901,"pinterest":7,"total":4203},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OkEtKFz2tVGHnDD8T-YMQOAC5-4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F449125%2Ff48ba53d-236e-4a92-9352-1709e1177275.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/dscU_ER4nyvVESfwI1u6dqAWsJw=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F42999%2Faf633c17-2285-41d8-bda0-32121016cb27.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6WNoPfKEu263sGvqnq0HQu4lkO0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F42999%2Faf633c17-2285-41d8-bda0-32121016cb27.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Bv8PMc3GNEf2-BIvq5eATQb4NrY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F42999%2Faf633c17-2285-41d8-bda0-32121016cb27.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4G5ux3BsMIfQuaXjsBQXhRKnGpg=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F42999%2Faf633c17-2285-41d8-bda0-32121016cb27.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yjXa-o6cemP7NkVoBPqrlgS0f-0=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F42999%2Faf633c17-2285-41d8-bda0-32121016cb27.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2pqvzHX","display_title":"Instagram rips off yet another service","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"UAftfFGE","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"It's beginning to look a lot like Pinterest.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Instagram rips off yet another service"},{"_id":"58cab9c928cc365d0d000093","id":"2017/03/16/pinterest-blocked-in-china","title":"The Chinese government has had enough of your recipes and decor photos","title_tag":null,"author":"Marcus Gilmer","post_date":"2017-03-16T16:13:58+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 16:13:58 +0000","formatted_date":"03/16/2017","formatted_shares":"642","sort_key":"1COyXP","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/16/pinterest-blocked-in-china/","content":{"plain":"China added another brick to the Great Firewall by blocking access to social media site Pinterest, making it harder for citizens to share recipes, memes, and whatever else Pinterest is used for. \nSEE ALSO: Google Scholar might finally be Google's way back into China\nTechCrunch reports that the site's users in China are now out of luck as censorship tool GreatFire has noted the site has been blocked for a week.

Both Stone and cofounder Ben Finkel are joining Pinterest as a result of the acquisition. Stone in a special adviser role (he will work with Chief Product Officer Evan Sharp) and Finkel as part of the growth product team.\nSEE ALSO: Snapchat teaches investor not to underestimate the power of 🍆🍆🍆 pics\nJelly's future is less clear. It's possible Pinterest could decide to continue supporting it, as it did with Instapaper, though this seems unlikely given Jelly's lackluster App Store rankings. More likely, it seems, would be Pinterest incorporating parts of Jelly into its own offerings. \n\"We’re still working out details, so there are unknowns,\" Stone wrote in a statement Wednesday. \"Will Jelly remain separate, or integrated somehow?\"\nJelly's Q&A app launched in 2014 with a lot of hype and promptly went nowhere. Stone and co then pivoted to a photo app called Super before pivoting back to Jelly last year -- this time retooling the Q&A app as a kind of search engine. \nBut the latest iteration of the app also failed to gain traction with users and had been steadily declining in App Store rankings since the 2016 relaunch, according to data from App Annie. \nPinterest and Stone both say it's because the two teams' visions line up nicely when it comes to search\nSo why would Pinterest buy an app (Bloomberg reports it's an all-stock deal, though exact terms haven't been disclosed) that was never really that popular to begin with? Pinterest and Stone both say it's because the two teams' visions line up nicely when it comes to search. (Stone was also an early investor in Pinterest so the two have something of a history together.)\n“The Jelly team's approach to an exploratory search powered by a mix of technology and human curation is closely aligned with our own vision,\" Sharp said in a statement. \n\"The addition of Biz Stone to the team, who’s one of the great product thinkers and creators of our time, will move us closer to our mission of building a product that helps people around the world discover and do what they love.”\nPinterest has been rapidly scaling up its efforts around search and discovery, particularly when it comes to visual search. Last month the company debuted a new feature called Lens, which allows users to search for items by taking photos, and the company launched a new AI initiative to focus on visual search, among other projects. \nWATCH: Vegans, this plant-based leather wallet is made just for you"},"shares":{"twitter":538,"google_plus":15,"linked_in":16,"facebook":124,"pinterest":3,"total":696},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/csNREWxbKVM_fU9Ns92C8_k3awM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F408238%2Fd11399db-eef7-4dc0-8381-34d7281084c3.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GGO1Ddjfokdj3ZPvwqw5fl023_s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39118%2Fdb638468-3981-4e18-9af2-fe8135e2284b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DqFrjOTL9jzk_MSUqgJ1e6718Cw=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39118%2Fdb638468-3981-4e18-9af2-fe8135e2284b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FvQRY_t5WzyDcHWovpkYU_76URI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39118%2Fdb638468-3981-4e18-9af2-fe8135e2284b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Et6AnOfLhQANU0kk4jZznlDgAGs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39118%2Fdb638468-3981-4e18-9af2-fe8135e2284b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GVpmrH4o5MWCjy7IWUgMLrPzQXA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39118%2Fdb638468-3981-4e18-9af2-fe8135e2284b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2mI1pi1","display_title":"Twitter cofounder Biz Stone now works for Pinterest","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"U8HmuaVn","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Pinterest and Jelly, anyone?","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Twitter cofounder Biz Stone now works for Pinterest"},{"_id":"58b5e57d9111ae7cde000004","id":"2017/02/28/pinterest-labs-ai","title":"Pinterest doubles down on AI because 'most of Pinterest hasn’t been built yet'","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2017-02-28T18:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"02/28/2017","formatted_shares":"776","sort_key":"1CITYb","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/28/pinterest-labs-ai/","content":{"plain":"When you think of artificial inteligence, Pinterest is likely not the first tech giant that comes to mind.\nThe company is hoping that will soon change. Pinterest is launching a new group within its organization dedicated to machine learning and AI research.

Leskovec, along with a small group of engineers from other teams, will lead the effort. The group will also tap engineers from elsewhere in the organization to contribute to research, work with university partners and speak at conferences and other industry events. \nAI has become increasingly important to the 7-year-old company\nThough most of the engineers involved with Labs will stay on their existing teams within the company, Pinterest is looking to hire a full-time researcher to work on Labs exclusively, the company says.\nThe goal of all this, of course, is to help Pinterest use machine learning and artificial intelligence to make its products better -- and fast. The company has been steadily ramping up its efforts in the space and AI has become increasingly important to the 7-year-old company. \nPinterest's visual search and discovery features have been of particular importance for the service.

So taking a photo of tomatoes, for instance, would show you relevant recipes, not just more food photos.\n\"It's allowing you to explore things in a way that's a lot more natural. It lets your eyes do the searching,\" Pinterest cofounder and CTO Evan Sharp said during a press event.\n\nSharp said new visual search features like Lens were part of the company's renewed effort toward making searches more natural. \"Traditional search is really great when you have the right words.\" But, he said, it \"can be tough... to translate information into a few words.\"\nPinterest also announced two other visual search features: \"Shop the Look\" and \"Instant Ideas.\" Shop the Look allows you to browse related products when you come across a pin you want to explore more. Tapping on specific parts of a pin will help you find products you can actually buy.\n\nSimilarly, Instant Ideas is meant to provide inspiration based on the objects users come across in pins. Tap on the circle on the bottom right corner of a pin and you can you browse a new feed for inspiration based on the topic.\n\nInstant Ideas and Shop the Look are both available now on Pinterest's apps and website.\nBONUS: Someone designed a mini recycling plant for your home"},"shares":{"facebook":208,"google_plus":14,"twitter":425,"pinterest":4,"linked_in":35,"total":686},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Tn92BDdLKunEGnAsRIst39Sbw3U=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F376605%2F83feda82-5737-452d-91df-1bc12eccb321.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eaPfENcpYrxE73DLqdPlVMngl_s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36209%2F04ffe1c7-9c40-42ba-80de-d494004fb7b6.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QICA1nSZ9L-7byN2uZXhm6GNzmo=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36209%2F04ffe1c7-9c40-42ba-80de-d494004fb7b6.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1_EAn_bX0NSlVdYFQLS-pq79owM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36209%2F04ffe1c7-9c40-42ba-80de-d494004fb7b6.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KnKZOJCA5VeB-hJKHy9DTtQlLNU=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36209%2F04ffe1c7-9c40-42ba-80de-d494004fb7b6.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/qg11QLNSKb9H_ZkjuM6fjqmgfwk=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36209%2F04ffe1c7-9c40-42ba-80de-d494004fb7b6.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2lryD1A","display_title":"Browsing Pinterest is about to get as easy as snapping a pic","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"lE6jr7Jv","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"You can now browse Pinterest based on photos you take in the real world.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"Browsing Pinterest is about to get as easy as snapping a pic"},{"_id":"5854624a28cc367d760002b1","id":"2016/12/16/pinterest-diversity-goals-results","title":"Pinterest misses, then lowers goal for female tech hires","title_tag":null,"author":"Patrick Kulp","post_date":"2016-12-16T21:53:11+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 21:53:11 +0000","formatted_date":"12/16/2016","formatted_shares":"562","sort_key":"1Ci2FC","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/12/16/pinterest-diversity-goals-results/","content":{"plain":"Pinterest has fallen short of its own goal to hire more women in tech roles, despite modest overall progress towards a more diverse workforce in the past year.\nThe social scrapbooking site released a yearly update on employee demographics in a blog post Friday.\nSEE ALSO: New customizeable book helps girls smash tech stereotypes\nIn it, the company stacked the diversity of its hires over the past year against ambitious target stats it had set for itself.\nPinterest said it managed to boost the portion of women in its tech departments from 21 percent to 26 percent  -- a marked improvement from the year before, when the number remained stagnant. \nBut the rate at which it hired women engineers -- 22 percent of all successful candidates -- undershot the 30-percent mark the company had hoped to reach.\nChief Executive Ben Silbermann claimed in the post that the discrepancy was in part due to a focus on placing women in senior positions, for which the hiring process tends to take longer.\nThe same goal for the next year was lowered to 25 percent to reflect that shortcoming.\n\"We still aspire to 30%—but realize it’s likely going to take more than 12 months to get there,\" Silbermann wrote.\nThe company had more success in other categories. The rate of new hires among underrepresented ethnicities exceeded the 8 percent goal for engineering roles by a percentage point and matched the 12-percent target for non-tech jobs. \nWhile the company brought on a few new top leaders of minority descent this year, its senior slate remains 70 percent white and 22 percent Asian without a single black employee.\nPinterest's workforce as a whole also remains predominantly white -- 49 percent of total employees -- and Asian -- 41 percent. The company did however manage to double its small fractions of black and Hispanic employees from 1 to 2 percent and 2 to 4 percent respectively.\nThe company credits the improvement in large part to a new executive hiring policy modeled after the \"Rooney Rule\" -- an NFL mandate that requires that at least one minority candidate be interviewed for every head coaching position. Silbermann says the policy will be expanded to more parts of the company in the upcoming year.\nActivism and critical media attention around the scarcity of women and minorities among tech workers has forced Silicon Valley businesses to be more forthcoming about disclosing hiring practices and diversity within their ranks in recent years.\nPinterest has been seen as a leader in this arena since one of its engineers, Tracy Chou, publicly posted an employee spreadsheet and called on other tech companies to do the same in 2013.  \nIt is also one of the few major companies to publicly divulge internal goals.\nWhile much progress has been made towards transparency in this regard among tech companies, improvement in the actual numbers has been much slower. The vast majority of these regular reports tend to show minimal steps forward at best.\nMany of these companies are already dragging their feet in releasing year-end stats. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Twitter, Pinterest and Salesforce had all delayed their planned announcements -- some even until the new year.\n\n   \n  "},"shares":{"facebook":138,"twitter":415,"google_plus":9,"total":562},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/70hFdEawyv0tM2JEoJrlgZ_rayA=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F321296%2F11c2c7bc-e5ee-4db0-a56c-ca970df8db20.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Wdw-xlWbHvmMvrpWW2hSYiQAQyM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31181%2Fbb6ea055-7fe1-47a8-b150-0e55606e29ca.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/doQKedK5njsf75wxrDWQ10hUDcU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31181%2Fbb6ea055-7fe1-47a8-b150-0e55606e29ca.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XEUT9DMmf1Mp7Rnlv89RkoKGld8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31181%2Fbb6ea055-7fe1-47a8-b150-0e55606e29ca.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2E3DDjtBV6FGUf_cj29MIgwkTIk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31181%2Fbb6ea055-7fe1-47a8-b150-0e55606e29ca.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0A-iyq_n8KMVChEbGLMdi5YhMmc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31181%2Fbb6ea055-7fe1-47a8-b150-0e55606e29ca.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hQa3Jy","display_title":"Pinterest misses, then lowers goal for female tech hires","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The company showed improvement in other categories.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Pinterest misses, then lowers goal for female tech hires"},{"_id":"58512abff11b2c6bcf000396","id":"2016/12/14/top-pinterest-trends-2017","title":"These are the hottest trends for 2017 according to Pinterest","title_tag":null,"author":"Rachel Thompson","post_date":"2016-12-14T11:19:24+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 11:19:24 +0000","formatted_date":"12/14/2016","formatted_shares":"1.1k","sort_key":"1Ch8rY","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/12/14/top-pinterest-trends-2017/","content":{"plain":"LONDON -- Out with the old, in with the new. As 2016 draws to a close, we can kiss farewell to hygge, unicorn eyeliner, and bejewelled crocs. \nSEE ALSO: Unicorn eyeliner is 2016's latest mythical beauty trend\nAs 2017 beckons, we're making room for the new -- and very exciting -- trends that will define the coming year. \nFrom distressed denim and slip dresses to fruit as a meat replacement, Pinterest is already predicting the biggest fashion, food and home trends of 2017 based on current search data. \nHere's what's in store for us trend-wise for the coming year.\nFASHION \n1. The bell sleeve\n\nFarewell off-the-shoulder, it's all about the romantic bell sleeve in 2017. Just try not to dip them in your coffee. \n2. Pins, patches and stickers\n\nAdorn your jackets, coats and tops with the most colourful array of pins, buttons and badges.  \n3. Slip dresses\n\nDon't worry about getting dressed in the morning, you can just wear your pjs. Just kidding. But the slip dress and top combo is what it's all about. \n4. Camel coats\n\nNude is the new black. Wear neutral tones like khaki and nude to nail this trend. \n5. Distressed denim\n\nThe devil's in the detail when it comes to denim. Go for lighter hues, higher waists and distressed details. \nFOOD\n1. Fruit as a meat substitute \n\nDon't bother topping your nachos with pork or chilli. Jackfruit has been dubbed the \"pulled pork for vegetarians\" and it's set to be the next big food craze. \n2.  Set-it-and-forget-it cooking\n\nSous vide is the lazy person's cooking hack. All you need to do is seal your ingredients in a plastic bag, cook them in a saucepan of water and then kick back and relax while it does all the work. \n3. Vegetable crisps\n\nAccording to Pinterest, healthy snack searches are up 200 percent this year, and \"clean eating chips,\" like zucchini chips are one of the most popular picks.\n4. Quinoa bowls\n\nThere is nothing more inviting that a bowl packed full of hearty ingredients. Pile on the superfoods and pepper with guac, cheese or whatever takes your fancy. \n5. Octopus\n\nOctopus is not as difficult to cook as it might seem. Try grilling it with a generous dose of lemon.\n\nHOME\n1. Climbing indoor plants\n\nIt's too cold to go outside, so why not bring the outdoors inside? Climbing plants are a great way to cheer up a bare shelf or lonely corner. \n2. Into the blue \n\nScandi style might have favoured white walls and surfaces, but 2017 is about to get an injection of navy and deep blue. Dark feature walls against a lighter backdrop are set to make an entrance next year. \n3. Reclaimed wood tiling\n\nA rustic alternative to subway tile.\n4. Make-your-own nightstand\n\nDon't bother with IKEA. Turn your hand to a touch of DIY and have a go at making your own nightstand. \n5. Farmhouse style \n\nStyle up your urban studio apartment with some countryside vibes. \nBONUS: This super precise handwriting robot is so satisfying to watch"},"shares":{"facebook":476,"twitter":552,"google_plus":14,"linked_in":9,"pinterest":1,"total":1052},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Fwkqh1aMst6EwU2CvT2OQg6ovoE=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30858%2Fpinterest.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-o4Ifk-UWsYFtkZoAynrGN2TZ8s=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30858%2Fpinterest.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ijFlVzA0RyIRmo5q6odaC6tEBIM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30858%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q61IB1xlNmVqjWliRcnHWrpzv7I=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30858%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Tp-_ITLLPqmh4zAFVJK33OcPVbo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30858%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/8y99VdwpPw_SL_xFVHk4IyXS_qw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30858%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hkRAn4","display_title":"These are the hottest trends for 2017 according to Pinterest","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG2zy0Nv","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Out with the old, in with the new.

Startup studio Betaworks bought a majority stake in the company in 2013 after founder Marco Arment said the app had \"grown far beyond what one person can do.\"\nthe acquisition also raises the question of whether Instapaper could eventually be integrated into Pinterest\nAt first glance, Instapaper, an app that allows users to save articles to read later, may seem like an odd target for the visual bookmarking site. But it appears Pinterest is particularly interested in using the Instapaper team to help build out its search and discovery features. \nThe site has recently doubled down on its shift toward e-commerce, and visual search and better discovery tools have been key to those efforts. The company previewed a new search feature earlier this summer that allows users to search and buy products by taking a photo with their smartphone.\nThe acquisition also raises the question of whether Instapaper could eventually be integrated into Pinterest, as many users already use the site to save articles, recipes, and other content. But it appears the plans is to keep the two separate -- at least for now. A spokesperson for Pinterest tells Mashable there are no current plans to integrate the two products. "},"shares":{"facebook":136,"twitter":579,"linked_in":38,"google_plus":5,"pinterest":6,"total":764},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z_IvT-YHtLZYHLbKqUr9nszbqN0=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F186909%2FPinterest_save_button.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/F20fQmVnMlI060o41MB2pNsFOZA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F18473%2FPinterest_save_button.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UAELGzvyho-FKZPvJSVIlyjmsJY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F18473%2FPinterest_save_button.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FoFGDu5xU694HWTb5Dii7fSnrZY=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F18473%2FPinterest_save_button.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/pJ-IJzDrJajVe5SAAPkAwM3Q6EU=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F18473%2FPinterest_save_button.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/OFk95-qtksN-HFoQZqEmQCHz6Fg=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F18473%2FPinterest_save_button.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bzzQDb","display_title":"Pin it for later?

During the trial, ads from entertainment and financial services brands proved especially effective, Bidgoli says. (He declined to reveal which finance companies participated.)\n\nThis isn't Pinterest's first stab at video advertising. The company released a similar product last spring called \"Cinematic Pins\" that autoplayed only when a user scrolled.\nThe move comes as many of Pinterest's rivals have become increasingly reliant on mobile video, where advertisers will pay a premium for a more comprehensive message than text or photos can offer. Facebook's juggernaut growth is credited to its success at growing a hub of video content, and Instagram has similarly doubled down on the format.\n\"There’s so much demand in the space,\" Bidgoli said. \"This is probably the biggest headline we’ll have this year.\" \nPinterest's aspirational nature makes it uniquely suited to many lifestyle and entertainment brands. The video ads can be paired with \"buy\" buttons, and the company suggests that advertisers might best fit the aesthetic of the site with how-to videos, recipes and other product-placement utility posts.\nThe startup was most recently valued at $11 billion in March when it pulled in a new fundraising haul of $367 million.\n   "},"shares":{"twitter":946,"facebook":220,"google_plus":18,"linked_in":157,"stumble_upon":273,"pinterest":6,"total":1620},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7LVQIdtab90I6dS51qRQEMlLGsc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F180875%2Fpinterest.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/JAzWNM0RChlT6GzFgQHgEYsK73A=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17912%2Fpinterest.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Sv_Ydm-FC5yG47ilQoj6mzyGAZ4=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17912%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yBmhJN0KrB5G-1ghWp8suvfNgO8=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17912%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PrQ0OnpwvJv6pn07XRFC5FR9XBo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17912%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wxdhM0Fx8FujJ-83-vsD-T43ixY=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17912%2Fpinterest.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bxd7nG","display_title":"Pinterest launches promoted clips in bid to cash in on video posts","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The company says there's more demand than ever for video ads.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/","tweet_text":"Pinterest launches promoted clips to cash in on growing number of video posts"},{"_id":"57addcb59111ae76f4000d4f","id":"2016/08/12/tech-wildlife-trade","title":"Tech companies vow to prevent illegal wildlife trading via their networks","title_tag":null,"author":"Kerry Flynn","post_date":"2016-08-12T14:26:56+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 14:26:56 +0000","formatted_date":"08/12/2016","formatted_shares":"2.4k","sort_key":"1Byf81","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/08/12/tech-wildlife-trade/","content":{"plain":"Looking to buy an elephant tusk on eBay? Might not be so easy. \nThe e-commerce giant, along with Etsy, Gumtree, Microsoft, Pinterest, Tencent and Yahoo, have signed on to a new commitment to prevent the sale of illegal wildlife products on their services. \nThe initiative is in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund, the International Fund for Animal Welfare and TRAFFIC, and was announced Friday to coincide with World Elephant Day. \nUnder the new policy, companies are seeking to prohibit the sale of wild live animals and animal body parts that are sourced illegally, species that are threatened by extinction and other protected animals. That includes rhino horns, pangolin parts and turtle meat.\nSEE ALSO: Finding things to buy on Pinterest is about to get a lot easier\nIt's the first time that conservation organizations have partnered with multiple tech companies. Prior, the WWF, for example, has worked with other organizations individually. \n”It is tremendously encouraging to see that leading online marketplaces and social media platforms are fighting back against wildlife cybercriminals to stamp out the illegal sale of endangered wildlife from their sites,\" Peter LaFontaine, campaigns manager for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said in a statement.\nNot every e-commerce company is listed as part of the initiative. Notable absences include Amazon and Facebook. \nBut that doesn't mean Facebook is not taking its own steps to curb illegal trading on the network. A quick search on Facebook's Shop section shows that \"elephant tusk\" is not searchable. \nFacebook Groups, however, have previously served as marketplaces for selling protected animals, according to a report from TRAFFIC in March. These private groups have also been platforms for selling guns, despite Facebook's effort to ban the practice. \n\"We are in dialogues with other companies too and some may be adopting the policy in future,\" Crawford Allan, senior director of TRAFFIC, told Mashable. \"We encourage companies to do so and are ready to support them.\""},"shares":{"twitter":1586,"facebook":762,"linked_in":36,"google_plus":13,"pinterest":6,"total":2403},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/fXRxhoF_JsG-M9a_UCaD-SUdBYc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F176297%2FGettyImages-158087294__1_.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/cRaXDGvghpMNIYEtvXjJ52WUc8U=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17513%2FGettyImages-158087294__1_.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3ygLtWXVU2x7I_ZaK9dp3GaCUA0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17513%2FGettyImages-158087294__1_.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/m1DIyq-bJ81o3FcnAvZyxaWef9s=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17513%2FGettyImages-158087294__1_.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_Y7sr5ImqVAF237dRDMoj5u3ioQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17513%2FGettyImages-158087294__1_.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ba8pXi8jo_kaLHZ3qp_XpaHmAPE=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F17513%2FGettyImages-158087294__1_.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2bcQCbn","display_title":"Tech companies vow to prevent illegal wildlife trading via their networks","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The pledge coincides with World Elephant Day.

In the months ahead, users will have the ability to take a photo of an object in the real world -- or say, a scene (like the decor of a cute cabin you stayed at over the weekend) -- and Pinterest will push out related recommendations based on the style. Mashable got a sneak preview of the feature (captured in the Vine below) and offline-to-online detection was smooth and took less than four seconds.The company also showed off a new automatic object detection feature on iOS that allows users to find products within a pin. For example, if you're looking at a pin of a woman wearing a bracelet, bag and pants, you can tap the visual search icon located at the top of the pin. This will put tiny dots on each item that can reveal more information about each product.\"Since an image can contain dozens of objects, we wanted to make it as simple as possible to start a discovery experience from any of them,\" the company said on its engineering blog. \"In the same way auto-complete improves the experience of text search, automatic object detection makes visual search a more seamless experience. Object detection in visual search also enables enable new features, like object-to-object matching.\"The move is a part of a greater effort to turn the photo-rich site into an e-commerce platform and make it easier for users to find products they like. “People are looking for ideas [on Pinterest]; they’re not looking for news or pictures of friends or family,” a company spokesperson told attendees, adding about 55% of Pinterest users consider it a place to shop.Last year, the company added buyable pins to its mobile platform -- allowing users to make product purchases directly from the site -- but Pinterest announced the feature will now be available on the web version, as well. Pinterest is also adding a shopping bag that follows you from page to page (accessible both on mobile or a laptop) and better viewing tools that show products at different angles. Shoppers will also be able to find new products on new merchant profiles (seen above); these pages show what's new, what's popular and what's on sale.  The company said it continues to work hard on building deeper learning algorithms, especially around the camera, to bridge the gap between offline and online shopping.Have something to add to this story?

And we could all learn a thing or two. In general, what the Internet refers to as \"mom hacks\" are becoming increasingly popular, especially as more millennials and digital natives become parents themselves. You'll find YouTube channels dedicated to sharing ideas and thousands of Pinterest boards. A book called Parenting Hacks became recently became top-rated on Amazon. SEE ALSO: 10 ways to be a happier, more fulfilled parent in 2016\"There are demands to think on our feet and come up with novel solutions to the challenges that seem to come from nowhere,\" says Rachelle Doorley, a proud \"hacking\" mother of two and the author of TinkerLab, a blog dedicated to fun projects and ideas for little inventors. \"Couple that with an understanding that the stages of childhood can pass quickly, and you have a need to find solutions that work, but don't have to last for years and years.\" Doorley has tried all kinds of hacks and says it's all about being productive. \"Since hacks are shortcuts that make our lives easier, anything that helps keep things calm and eliminates some of the chaos of parenting is going to be a lifesaver.\" But in the search to make things easier, parents still don't have time to scour the web for ideas...and compare themselves to moms and dads in the process. \"Begin with what's challenging you the most. If it's getting out the door on time in the mornings, look for ways to make the morning routine easier. If you have a new baby, look for ways to simplify your diaper bag,\" Doorley suggests.She shared some of her favorite and most effective hacks with us. We added our own, too.1. Old wallets make surprisingly effective distractions.\"Carrying the old wallet in my purse was so easy, and a great way to keep my kids entertained when they were little and wanted to root through my purse at the doctor's office,\" says Doorley. She recommends filling it with play money and old cards so the little ones will be entertained with mommy's things without actually damaging her stuff. 2. To-go emergency meds\"Mommy, I have a bellyache!\" When you hear this one hour into a five-hour road trip, come prepared. Taking just a small amount of \"just in case\" meds can prevent emergency stops in the middle of Nowheresville.3. Make snacking easy.\"Fill a basket with kid-approved, grab-and-go snacks such as seaweed, applesauce and crackers. Do the same thing for the fridge with whole fruit, yogurt and cheese sticks,\" recommends Doorley. This way, kids will have easy access to healthy food, rather than having to search for things or ask for help every time.4. Make-it-yourself pushpops.    We've recently discovered my oldest son may have a dairy intolerance and these homemade pushpops filled with fruit, almond milk, hemp seeds, and greens have been a LIFESAVER in getting him good protein in his lunch box! Plus it's 70 degrees today ☀️😎 and the other kids love them as a warm weather \"treat\" #momwin GET THE FULL HOW-TO AT LINK IN PROFILE. A photo posted by Mom Hacks I 🏆 Family Gear (@modrentmessykid) on Apr 1, 2016 at 12:39pm PDTWe love the Modern Parents Messy Kids blog. Steph and her super cute kids post all kinds of creative parent solutions, like fun crafts and organizing tips. For instance, it can be hard for kids to understand why they can't have the same treats as their friends or siblings, so give them a yummy alternative instead.5. DIY sensory boxSensory play is extremely important for early childhood development. This idea,= from Doorley's blog was a \"lifesaver.\" \"When my children were toddlers this came out almost every evening. I would switch out the objects inside to connect with the seasons or their interests.\" She used sand and scoopers, dry wheat berries, funnels, cotton balls, snowy animal figurines, cloud dough and goop.6. Keep track of medicine safely.This simple idea from Lovezilla ensures accurate medication tracking, especially if you have more than one caregiver working different \"shifts.\" 7. Coloring fortStep up the cardboard fort by letting your kids get creative with crayons. This fun, inexpensive toy will keep them occupied for a long time — and you can teach them about upcycling in the process. 8. Make socks slip-proof.    As much as we all enjoy that famous sliding scene Tom Cruise does so gracefully in Risky Business, when my toddler is sliding in his socks I'm a wee concerned. So I took my glue gun and made grips for his socks. All I did was put little dots on the bottom of them and it stops tumbles (well... from socks). Note: if you don't have a hot glue gun, puffy paint works too! #whattoexpect #momhacks #riskybusiness #momlife @emmabingwte A photo posted by WhatToExpect (@whattoexpect) on Apr 29, 2016 at 9:03am PDTThe What To Expect blog has some awesome inspiration for parents, and shares tips from moms like this one on its Instagram.9.

Sure, she might ooh and ahh at the roses and necklace, and even eat up a box of chocolates. But, if you really want to bring a tear to her eye, forget the one-size-fits-all gifts. Every mom is unique, and so shopping for the perfect present requires some thought — but it doesn’t have to take a ton of time.We’ve rounded up the best gift ideas for moms (and grandmas, too). Whether she loves to be pampered or appreciates an unusual present, here’s how you can DIY or buy your way into her heart.For moms who need a spa dayDIY: Jasmine tea body scrubMaybe you can’t afford to send mom to the spa for a day, but she’s guaranteed to be impressed with this DIY body scrub infused with fragrant jasmine tea leaves. Even better, she’ll never have to leave the comfort of her own bathroom to get polished skin and a moment of relaxation (the scent of jasmine tea is proven to have sedative effects).Buy: Lavender aura kimono robeWhat’s a home spa without a luxurious robe? Try this one made of fair trade certified organic cotton in a light purple hue that evokes serenity and will make mom feel like the queen she is.For moms who adore bathsDIY: “Wine” bathVinotherapy is actually a thing. Though we wish it meant pouring wine into the tub and drinking up, the real idea is to harness red grapes’ antioxidant power in soothing body treatments. You can make mom a simple (and ultra skin-softening) bath oil by combining grapeseed oil and another essential oil of your choice (go for her favorite scent). To make: Pour two cups of grapeseed oil into a jar or bottle and add in 40 drops of any essential oil. (Try lavender for relaxation or orange for something more energizing.)Buy: Lavender bubble bathFor a ready-made aromatherapy bath, try this relaxing potion. It’ll have mom dreaming of lavender fields sprinkled with sweet herbs.For moms who hop on beauty trendsDIY: Sheet mask kitIf you’ve got a mom who’s totally in-the-know as far as beauty trends go, she’ll love this handmade Korean sheet mask. The trend has taken the world by storm in recent years, and as it turns out, making them is pretty easy. Simply put the following ingredients together in a cute box and include a card with the instructions:Ingredients2 to 3 drops serum1 tablespoon rosewater1 tablespoon vegetable glycerine3 to 6 cotton pads (or gauze)InstructionsIn a bowl, combine serum, rosewater and vegetable glycerine and mix thoroughly. Soak cotton pads or gauze in mixture. Separate cotton layers and place them over the entire face, including the forehead, nose, cheeks, chin and jawline. Leave on for 20 minutes. Peel off and massage any leftover product into the skin.Buy: Skin brushDry brushing may be a centuries-old practice from Ancient Greece, but modern-day beauty enthusiasts have brought it back into the mainstream. This essential tool enables excellent full-body exfoliation and, in the process, will also increase circulation for positively glowing skin.For moms serious about skin careDIY: Five-step skin care kitFace wash, scrub, toner, moisturizer, eye cream — adhering to a disciplined skin care routine takes a lot of products. But this DIY kit can introduce mom to an easy regimen with all-natural ingredients to boot. All you need are 11 items to create this homemade collection that will leave her with the gift that keeps on giving: a healthy complexion.Buy: Cleanser + scrub + toner + moisturizer + eye creamDon’t have time to DIY? Mom will love these picks just as much, especially when she learns they’re all cruelty-free and made with clean and safe ingredients.For moms with a body butter habitDIY: Whipped vanilla body butterJust because it’s called body butter doesn’t mean it has to smell like food. With this easy-to-make DIY version, there are no nauseating artificial fragrances — just the natural scents of vanilla, cinnamon, almond and coconut that gives mom a real sweet treat.Buy: Shea body butterThis super rich body butter by Nourish Organic will give dry skin deep, decadent moisture. And the price tag is just as nice.For moms obsessed with coconut oilDIY: Whipped coconut oil body butterIt seems like coconut oil is the holy grail of natural beauty ingredients these days. But what some might not know is that you can whip it for a creamy, fluffy texture that feels like a lotion (and will not have the normal rock solid consistency at cold temperatures).Buy: Bliss coconut oil body butterIf you’re in a pinch, buy this body butter that manages to make coconut oil even more luxurious with added shea butter and sunflower oil. Investing in a jar of this fair trade product is also a gift to workers in West Africa who benefit from every purchase.For moms who love hair careDIY: Coconut-rosemary-peppermint shampoo + shea butter conditionerHere’s an herbaceous dynamic duo that will really get mom into all-natural hair care. While the scent of the shampoo fills the shower with irresistible aromas, the vitamin E and healthy fats in the organic coconut base work to replenish hair and promote growth. The conditioner takes it a step further with shea butter and coconut oil to hydrate locks, and vegetable glycerin to add even more moisture to give hair a soft and shiny look and feel.Buy: Moroccan argan oil shampoo + conditionerThese two are bestsellers for a reason. The combo is rich with fatty acids pulled from sea buckthorn and pumpkin seed oils — and the argan oil and argan stem cells further help hair reach its best shine potential.For moms who DIYDIY: Essential oil blendsTinkering moms will definitely appreciate a good DIY gift. Pick up some essential oils, and create mood-boosting blends that she can use to inspire joy, serenity, alertness and even soothe PMS. Or, let her be hands-on by passing along our guide with tips for how to mix up essential oils that she can enjoy every day.Buy: DIY beauty kitPut together a generous goodie box packed with all the essentials she’ll need to whip up as many beauty elixirs as her heart desires. (Better yet, get a mother-daughter day on the books to try some experiments together.) Here’s some DIY beauty staples to include:Grapeseed oilCoconut oilBrown sugarCacao powderApple cider vinegarRaw honeyShea butterCocoa butterTurmericGreen teaLavender oilVitamin E oilRosehip seed oilFor moms who love fragrant candlesDIY: Scented coconut oil candlesMaking your own candles doesn’t take burning the midnight oil. It’s easier than you think, and there’s a major bonus gift: Mom won’t have to breathe in harmful petrochemicals from the paraffin wax. This alternative uses beeswax, which can actually purify the air.Buy: Lavender coconut wax candleIf candlemaking is not your thing, no problem. Scoop up this calming French lavender statement piece made from coconut wax. So fancy.For moms who do tea timeDIY: Herbal and floral tea blendsIf your mom loves sipping a good afternoon tea or partaking in an herbal nightcap, this is the gift for her. Add a personal touch by concocting custom tea blends, including a relaxing combo of lavender with Earl Grey; a fresh digestive tonic with mint, rosemary and lavender; and a spicy dark brew with black tea, rose and cardamom.Buy: Green tea latte mixIf matcha is mom’s favorite, she’s sure to love this creamy green tea mix with hints of coconut (and sans milk if she is dairy-free). Or, you can always make your own sampler box full of a wide variety of tea — and coffee is she goes both ways.For foodie momsDIY: Breakfast pizzaInstead of going out for brunch, make mom breakfast in bed like the old days with this simple yet fulfilling breakfast pizza for two. It’s Paleo and gluten-free with bacon, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes and eggs to make it a hearty start to Mother’s Day — or any day!Buy: SuperfoodsNo matter what cuisine your mom likes best, superfoods like chia seeds, maca, cacao powder and cacao nibs are a must for well-rounded meals (to use her own words).For chocoholic momsDIY: Almond butter cupsWho could say no to a healthy version of the classic peanut butter cup? These special treats are Paleo and vegan-friendly, but also quite tasty. One bite and mom won’t even miss “real candy.” And there will be no guilt for you when she urges you to indulge with her. Win-win!Buy: Dark chocolate trufflesThis DIY or buy choice is a real toss-up because we love these organic truffles just as much as the homemade treats above. The dark chocolate nibbles are made with cacao from Ecuador — one of the most divine sources in the world — giving them an exotic twist on the go-to box of candy.For earthy momsDIY: Herb, fruit and vegetable plantsForget about flowers that wilt in a few days — a plant can last until next Mother’s Day! Just grab some seed packets — popular picks include tomatoes, peppers, squash, basil, arugula, kale and carrots — and sow the seeds in decorative planters (or you can even paint one yourself). Mom will absolutely adore her garden-in-the-making — especially once the goods start to grow.Buy: Bamboo coastersEco-friendly moms will really appreciate these cute motif coasters made from bamboo — one of the strongest, most sustainable and abundant types of wood in the world. Durable and complementary to most home decor, they will forever be a beautiful token of love.For mystical momsDIY: Lavender salt scrubWe all know moms are sages, but those who tap even more into their mystical side will appreciate this scrub that transcends regular spa products with the healing powers of Epsom salt. To make, mix two cups of salt with one cup of carrier oil — olive or coconut are good picks, but we also like almond as a sweet-smelling choice. Then, add 20 to 30 drops of lavender oil. Store in a glass jar with a lid, and tie a bow around the top for the perfect finishing touch.Buy: Himalayan salt lampFew are able to resist the magnetizing glow of a salt lamp. But, this little gadget is functional, too. It emits negative ions that bind to positively charged particles like allergens, dust, pollen, fungus, pet dander and odors, and neutralizes them in the process. The lamp will leave the air in mom’s home so fresh, plus, it’s a pretty cool novelty decoration.For moms who love a unique giftDIY: Upcycled serving trayMom has probably run out of room on her fridge for your artwork, so it’s time to start filling up another room. Try this multi-functional serving tray that will easily be the piece de resistance.First, you’ll want to find a new or vintage serving tray or board (whatever style she likes best). Then, head to the craft store and pick up non-toxic chalkboard paint, chalk, a paintbrush and masking tape. Place the masking tape along the edges of the tray wherever you want the paint to stop.To decorate, start with the paint. Follow the directions on the container — typically you can do a couple of coats, wait one hour, add a third coat and then let dry for 24 hours. Then doodle away with the chalk or add a sweet message (or, you can wrap it up for her to use later, like when she wants to label her cheese tray). Gift wrap the tray with brown paper and a simple black ribbon for a chic and rustic presentation.Buy: Emote throw blanketUnconventional moms will love the quirky design of this soft blanket. (Seriously, it feels like getting the warmest hug on Earth — something she should know all about.) For even more effect, go all out with the matching pillow cover.Got your favorite gift for mom picked out? Whether you opt for homemade or store-bought, she will definitely never forget the time you started her edible garden or gave her that funky little salt lamp. So, leave the roses and jewelry for the amateurs."},"shares":{"facebook":79,"linked_in":18,"twitter":852,"google_plus":12,"total":961},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/BkiW-cOWf2oo5UgBkQCiZecBB64=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F79438%2FThumb2.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kReBrtN84qYI7QOEiE2ra3ryEwU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F7759%2FThumb2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XDOsJ8B2MedmfMLvKazi12xLMU0=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F7759%2FThumb2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9Pr4fuZnt5EQ1miQ80ZCpkp2mTM=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F7759%2FThumb2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/FlMgBy8Qg0KzeNSMtA_7m4Grrac=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F7759%2FThumb2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7vX8fepb-R8HgvqlHwZ4-W4__as=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F7759%2FThumb2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/21zLKMU","display_title":"25 thoughtful DIY gift ideas that every mom will love","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"If you really want to bring a tear to your mom's eye, time to forget the one-size-fits-all gifts.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Lifestyle","channel_label":"Lifestyle","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/lifestyle/","tweet_text":"25 thoughtful DIY gift ideas that every mom will love"},{"_id":"5721d20097b2f84f8c000b17","id":"2016/04/28/pinterest-featured-collections","title":"Pinterest launches featured collections as international growth soars","title_tag":null,"author":"Karissa Bell","post_date":"2016-04-28T09:03:10+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 09:03:10 +0000","formatted_date":"04/28/2016","formatted_shares":"1.4k","sort_key":"1AVHQO","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/04/28/pinterest-featured-collections/","content":{"plain":"Pinterest is growing like crazy. The company, which passed 100 million users last fall, now says most of its users are from outside of the United States -- a significant milestone for the San Francisco-based startup. Now, the company is launching featured collections -- curated collections of trending topics localized to the UK, France, Germany, Brazil and Japan -- to further entice its international users.SEE ALSO: Pinterest makes DIY easier with new How-to PinsThe collections, which are chosen by Pinterest editors, brands and other \"tastemakers\" are meant to help people find relevant content in their language. Each featured collection will be made up of pins, boards, searches and pinners that are trending in their region. Pinterest users in the UK, France, Germany, Brazil and Japan can find featured collections in the app's explore section. The company plans to roll them out to more countries in the next few months.For Pinterest, the new feature highlights just how important international markets are as it looks to grow. If the startup hopes to start selling ads in new markets, then it will need to attract more users outside of the United States, where the company currently sells most of its ads. Pinterest began a big push earlier this month to ramp up its advertising in the UK and plans to open its ad business to Canada, Australia and Ireland later this year, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Pinterest said in a blog post Wednesday that Germany, Brazil, France and Japan are among the fastest growing countries for the company so it's not surprising they would choose to bring featured collections to those markets first. (Russia, South Korea and Mexico are also seeing \"significant growth,\" according to the company.) Pinterest didn't provide a specific breakdown of how many of its 100 million users are located outside on the United State but noted that international expansion has been \"our most important challenge since transitioning from desktop to mobile in 2012.\" Have something to add to this story?

Clean your drainWith just a few simple incisions you can avoid the dreaded smell and toxic fumes of drain cleaner and make your own de-clogger. 2. Wasp trapWe all need to help save the bee population, but wasps are a bit different. You definitely want to rid of the stinging, house-eaters before it turns into something like this monster nest. 3. Paint dabbersAn easy craft for kids or if you've finished your adult coloring books already. You can also use the bottom of soda bottles to make a cherry blossom painting. 4. Glass pasta (or anything) holdersThe water that comes in glass jars tends to be more expensive, so get the most bang for your buck and turn them into super convenient and stylish storage containers.  5. No-sew zipper bottle containersA simple way to organize your art supplies, travel makeup brushes, or even snacks. Anything \"no-sew\" you can sign us up for. 6. DIY spray paint containerIf you have the perfect color in a regular can but need to convert it to a spray, this is much simpler (and cheaper!) than bringing it to a hardware store to be put into a spray can. 7. SprinklerThere is certainly no age limit on summer fun, and if you're too ashamed to go to a toy store and buy one for yourself, this is an easy craft. Anyone can enjoy this idea, even a moose looking to cool off. 8. Dog toyDogs should be supervised when using this just in case they break through the sock to the plastic; ingesting plastic is potentially dangerous. However, for the curious pups that like to go hunting for their fun or treats, they'll love burrowing into this DIY toy.9. PlanterThis planter is self watering, as the holes in the cap absorb the water at the bottom half of the bottle. This is especially great for grasses and other fairly leafy plants. 10. Glass bottle mini ecosystemA super cool idea! All you need for this DIY project is some shells or stones, water, a freshwater arthropod and pond scum. You know, things you have lying around the house.

The strategy started with the introduction of Rich Pins, which allow certain content to be hosted right in the Pin instead of linking outside. This includes anything from an app download button to maps and recipes.The exclusivity of the new feature could possibility lift with a paywall in the future, creating a pretty clear divide between bigger content producers on Pinterest and regular users. Pinterest bringing in the big-name brands for the How-to Pins also shows its move into more revenue-building avenues. The How-to Pins are now available in the U.S., UK, France and Germany on the web and on Android. Pinterest said it will launch on iOS soon. Have something to add to this story?

And let's face it, baby ducks and pastel colors can be irritating to anyone. But baby shower themes that more inclusive for men are on the rise, says Pinterest. Traditionally masculine themes that include beer, poker and BBQ are emerging, as well as pins about \"Huggies and Chuggies\" or \"Beer, Dudes and Diapers.\"Some are dubbing these baby showers \"Dad-chelor parties.\"SEE ALSO: How to throw a gender-neutral baby showerIn 2015 Pinterest searches for the term \"man showers\" increased by 149%, and \"co-ed showers,\" celebrations for both moms and dads, increased by 255%. (Don't worry, these search terms should be SFW on Pinterest.)While the differences in themes risk reinforcing gender stereotypes, some people nonetheless prefer alternative showers regardless of gender norms — ones with dip, chicken wings and diaper cakes. Whether parents want one co-ed shower, two distinct showers or none at all, it's your party and you can customize if you want to. Here is how some dads are doing it.Mashable spoke to a father-to-be named Jon who threw his own \"Dad-chelor Party.\" \"It was a good excuse to get all of my friends together before my 'availability' becomes a little more limited,\" he said. \"We talked, drank beer and ate food.\"Jon and his friends rented out a local restaurant. They didn't play any games or have a theme, and he didn't receive any gifts other than advice about being a father. \"There's a lot of 'American' tradition around bridal showers and baby showers for women, so it was nice to put something on the calendar for my friends. I'm sure a lot of other men would enjoy the same. Some of my guy friends who are now parents had planned something similar (like a gathering or a weekend trip with their friends).\"A male-only shower might be a good equivalent when parents choose to divide parties by gender. Some women feel it's important to retain a female-only tradition as an opportunity for candid discussions of pregnancy and body issues. Baby showers are often thrown by friends or family of the parents-to-be, who may be more traditional in who they invite to the festivities.But don't forget the co-ed or partnered shower, which can be valuable option for same-sex as well as heterosexual parents. Recently, New York-based party planner Seri Kertzner of Little Miss Party Planner designed a shower for Megan Kopf, head of PR at NBC. With the help of TODAY hosts Savannah Guthrie and Natalie Morales, the party included the father, Britt, in the festivities. The prospective parents played a game where each answered baby-related questions, such as \"Who gained more weight during pregnancy?\" If it was Megan, they held up the pink paddle, if it was Britt they held up the blue.There's a lot to be said about incorporating a father-to-be into the baby shower tradition, something that is still primarily seen as a female-only event. The opportunity to celebrate, voice fears and spend time with loved ones is something all parents can benefit from, after all. From there, it can be beer or champagne, pastel or army green — as long as you're having fun.Have something to add to this story?

This fashion dilemma can haunt us, from fashion lovers to trend observers and everyone in between.TechInsider's Caroline Moss thought she'd found the solution, hiding in plain sight on Pinterest. Instead of creating outfit inspiration boards like many Pinterest users, Moss decided to play a kind of game. We dubbed her experiment \"Pinterest Roulette.\" Every morning Moss would choose an article of clothing from her closet, then type it into Pinterest search alongside the word \"outfit\" and let the inspiration wash over her.\"I had just purchased a new pair of leopard skinny pants, but I had no idea what to wear with them,\" Moss wrote. \"In a desperate attempt to keep the pants hanging in my closet, I plugged a description into Pinterest's search bar, and ... I saw the platform begin to change.\"SEE ALSO: The differences between what men and women search on PinterestLike Moss, I often consult Pinterest with questions of how to construct outfits more creatively. I just approach it differently, typing in style-oriented tags like \"grunge,\" or \"90s\" into the search bar and comb through pins until I find what I want. Moss's \"[clothing item]\" plus \"outfit\" approach seemed more streamlined and efficient, so I decided to give it a try for a week.Monday: Casual and sportyI began my quest simply, by searching \"flannel outfit.\" Flannel shirts have become a staple of my wardrobe, and I was excited to find new ways to wear them. But the problem I ran into time and time again was the prescriptive brand of style that lurks on Pinterest's \"outfit\" tag. It's cute. It's classy. It's chic. But it's not me.It's also — dare I say — very basic. There's nothing wrong with pairing a flannel shirt with a tee and jeans and calling it a day, but I've seen it all before. I've also seen the seemingly innovative flannel-tied-around-waist look and the whole flannel-over-dress situation. There's nothing wrong with these outfits — they're just not particularly fresh.Mithya Srinivasan, who works in the consumer communications department at Pinterest, shared the top 10 pins on the outfit tag with Mashable. Unsurprisingly, these outfits feature ballet flats paired with blazers, polka dot tops paired with mint cardigans and striped dresses paired with army jackets. These pins don't challenge me to see my wardrobe differently; they reiterate the sense of style I've seen on the pages of a J.Crew catalog.  To me, the outfits are boring.It wasn't until I gave up on my \"flannel\" search and began my \"snapback\" one that I found an innovative way to style my favorite shirt. The outfits on the \"snapback\" tag were more creative, and pinners combined patterns and colors in more daring ways. The outfit that drew me in paired a flannel shirt with a snapback, which excited me because I realized I could kill two birds — or outfit tags — with one stone. Plus, the colors I saw on the tag inspired me to mix two bold pieces with similar tones, creating a playful, casual look.Tuesday: Blazer up I came across a handful of genuinely interesting outfits I wanted to recreate, but they were geared toward warmer weather. Open-toed heels just aren't my friend when the temperature is in the 40s, nor are crop tops or lightweight t-shirts.Srinivasan told Mashable the spring tag has been trending lately, and pins about spring outfits, fashion and nails have all been on the rise. She said, \"Pinners are planners, so they're usually looking forward.\"Unfortunately for me, I needed inspiration for the now, not the future. Adapting spring outfits for cold weather wasn't a terribly challenging task, but having to do so certainly wasn't ideal.I wanted a new way to wear my gray shift dress — a staple I assumed would work perfectly in Pinterest Roulette. The problem? The \"shift dress\" tag was overflowing with spring inspiration. So I had to add the \"winter\" tag to get anything remotely weather-appropriate. I ended up pairing my go-to basic with a blazer, chain necklace and booties, thanks to this pin. Though this wasn't far off from how I would normally style the dress (I would do the same with a cardigan), the blazer added a nice, professional touch — transforming the look from comfy cute to classy cute. (This was also the most classically Pinterest look I wore all week. I tried to edge it up with darker neutrals, though.)Wednesday: The chokerIn a couple of cases, I found killer outfits but didn't have the means to imitate them. Maybe I was lacking a colorful faux fur coat Kendall Jenner wore or missing the drapey knit needed to finish off a look. In any case, Pinterest Roulette sparked in me a little retail envy — something Moss said she didn't experience.\"One of the most surprising things I've learned about using Pinterest in this way is that it doesn't make me feel like I need to go shopping all of the time,\" Moss wrote.This just wasn't the case for me. For Moss, Pinterest outfit inspiration invited her to see new ways to wear her wardrobe. For me, it did the same, but other elements were required to pull off the outfits I was going for. This is likely a difference in personal style preferences.Still, I was able to land on an awesome Kendall Jenner look that I did have the resources to create. I appreciated that Pinterest provides an intersection of layperson and celebrity street style, because it gives pinners more options to choose from. Though I stayed true to Jenner's silhouette, I was pretty liberal with the colors and patterns. This led to an outfit that was clearly inspired by — and not an exact replica of — Jenner's look. And I have to say, I was pretty happy with the end result.Thursday: Downtown girlI own a pretty sweet grandpa cardigan that is two parts comfort, one part vintage. It features a colorful teal, blue and white print that I can't put into words, and that proved to be an issue when I tried to find outfit inspo for it via Pinterest Roulette.It didn't matter what combination of tags I typed into the search bar, I kept drawing a blank. \"Vintage,\" \"patterned,\" \"grandpa,\" \"oversized,\" — nothing helped. And I was left with a Pinterest Roulette failure reiterated by several pins featuring basic knits. I even tried Moss's instructions for how to prevail in this specific situation. \"Make your search terms as vague as possible and use the suggestions Pinterest comes up with as a jumping off point,\" she wrote. Unfortunately, no luck. My pink printed joggers didn't go over very well either.By this point, I'd grown tired of the straightforward outfits I'd been wearing and wanted to experiment with bolder pieces. When the joggers and the cardigan didn't pan out, I decided to go full grunge.I knew my \"beanie\" would be more successful in the Pinterest Roulette game than my statement pieces were, simply because it was easier to describe. But I was disappointed to find the outfits on the tag uninspiring.I resorted to my old ways, adding the \"grunge\" tag to \"beanie outfit,\" and immediately found more success. Outfit after outfit inspired me, and I decided on one with a full skirt — knowing I could pull in a leather circle skirt I'd thought of including in my experiment. Again, I played with patterns and colors — straying from the outfit in the original pin. I maintained the vibe, however, and created a look that echoes the inspiration without copying it.I also came to the conclusion that perhaps the way to play this game was to throw in an adjective tag (\"grunge,\" \"edgy,\" \"athletic\") after all.Friday: Mix and matchDay 5 was all about finding a fun way to wear a \"leather skirt\" I just bought. I worried I might have to add \"pencil\" to the equation — fearing I'd draw pins of leather circle skirts, like the one I wore Thursday.But this process ended up going more seamlessly than I'd expected. In no time, I'd surfaced plenty of ways to style my recent purchase and settled on one that was straightforward and professional.Though the outfit construction is pretty basic (tee + skirt + jewelry), pairing this skirt with this specific tee hadn't come to mind. So in this case, Pinterest Roulette worked in my favor. I had to add my oversized jacket to swag up the classic outfit, though.For experimentation's sake, I put myself in the shoes of a man trying to play the Pinterest Roulette game. I typed in masculine clothing items like \"tie\" and \"suit\" with \"outfit,\" and continued to get pins of women. (\"Suit\" came up with many images of swimsuits, which given the season, I should have anticipated.)The problem is usually alleviated with the simple addition of the \"man\" tag, though men will likely have to sort through some lady fashion photos anyway.Sorry, guys. Maybe this will inspire you to hop aboard the androgynous train making its way through fashion lately.End of week thoughtsI want to be clear: This approach isn't horrible. Moss has found much success in her Pinterest Roulette experience, and I'm sure plenty of others — especially those who thrive off the classic Pinterest sense of style — would as well. I, myself, was inspired to create a few outfits I might not have otherwise thought of.The issue is it's not as one-size-fits-all as Moss's original post implies. This wasn't the one-stop solution to that closet-full-of-clothes dilemma I'd always dreamed of. It was yet another semi-solution — an alleviation of wardrobe-induced boredom that involves time, effort and scrolling. Pinterest Roulette was an interesting experiment for a week. Will I play again? Maybe. But I anticipate regressing back to my \"grunge,\" \"90s,\" \"edgy\" search terms and carefully crafted outfit inspiration boards more than anything.And so, the quest for creative styling ideas continues. Have something to add to this story?

He then publicly revealed a long series of frustrations with Twitter's diversity efforts.\n\nIn particular, he lamented an executive's ill-advised suggestion to solve the problem of too few non-white faces by \"creating a tool\" that would analyze job candidates' last names to pinpoint ethnicities in the hiring pool.\n\n\"There was very little diversity in thought and almost no diversity in action,\" Miley explained in a remarkably candid post about a hot button issue in Silicon Valley.\n\nSo it was that much more mind-boggling when Twitter, shamed by this issue in November, revealed its new head of diversity was... a white man. \n\nThe social network, long run by a board of all white men and a procession of CEOs who are white men, had disappointed again. The reactions were swift and damning.\n\n\"The choice of that particular person definitely matters,\" says Monique Woodard, executive director of Black Founders, a non-profit focused on building opportunities in the technology world for black entrepreneurs. \"The African American community loves to use Twitter, but we are not seeing the same makeup reflected in the company.\"\n\nSuch is the challenge that the biggest names in tech face heading into 2016 as they look to prove to potential recruits, customers, legislators and, yes, themselves that Silicon Valley is more than just a bunch of white dudes wearing hoodies.\n\nLike Twitter, many of the best known companies were founded by young white men who hired more of the same in their early days. As they expanded and matured, industry watchers say that simple fact left its imprint on each company's DNA and hiring mentality. White men there early rose up the ranks and hired other people who went to school with them, worked with them, had the same background as them, looked like them. \n\nTake one glance at the senior leadership chart for Apple, another company that has pushed publicly for greater diversity, and you'll see the problem.\n\nTwo years ago, however, tech companies began releasing a steady drip of transparency reports shedding light on their gender and racial breakdowns. They earned praise for the transparency, but scrutiny for the disappointing numbers. \n\nSince then, public and private tech companies have struggled to find the right roadmap to show momentum.\n\n\"To be honest, no one is really getting it right,\" says Candice Morgan, who earlier this month was name the first head of diversity at Pinterest, a social bookmarking startup valued at $11 billion. \"I think that intentions are good, but because this is a younger focus for this industry, all of us have a lot to do.\"\n\nSilicon Valley forced to re-program itself\n\nPinterest, or more accurately one of its few female engineers at the time, helped kickstart the conversation around greater transparency for diversity in tech with a single, critical post published on Medium in 2013. \n\n\"The actual numbers I’ve seen and experienced in industry are far lower than anybody is willing to admit,\" Tracy Chou wrote at the time, calling for companies to release more diversity data. \"But it’s hard for companies to admit that they’re working through any issues when they want to paint the rosy picture for recruiting.\"\n\nJesse Jackson, a prominent civil rights activist, began showing up at shareholder meetings for each of the major publicly traded tech companies, calling for them publicize their diversity numbers. In 2014, Google, LinkedIn, Yahoo and Pinterest did just that, creating more pressure for the rest to follow in their footsteps.\n\nJust as Chou anticipated, these reports shattered the industry's long coveted \"rosy picture.\" Silicon Valley, the numbers showed again and again, is mostly white and mostly male. \n\n\"The first step of any 12-step program is acknowledging that we have a problem,\" says Anne Toth, who oversees diversity efforts as VP of people and policy at Slack, the popular workplace messaging startup. It is one of the few private technology companies to disclose diversity numbers.\n\nAcknowledging that problem, she says, represents a \"sea change\" for Silicon Valley, which has long pretended that anyone and everyone can get ahead on brains alone, omitting the fact that skin color, gender and age play a role. Tech industry employees must now re-program the way they think about their own success.\n\n\"In Silicon Valley, there's a notion that we exist in a meritocracy. It assumes an even-playing field. It assumes everyone is being measured very quantitatively and analytically, and that success and achievement here is based on some uniform calculation,\" Toth says. \"I think what we’re starting to see now is that may not necessarily be true.\"\n\nAs with most things in this industry, it required data to make a change. \n\n\"It was lack of awareness,\" says Pat Wadors, SVP of global talent at LinkedIn, who launched the dialogue about diversity by presenting data on it to the CEO. \"They didn't know they had a problem until they saw it.\"\n\nCan you \"disrupt\" diversity?\n\nOnce the tech companies acknowledge they have a problem, they often turn to Joelle Emerson.\n\nEmerson started her career as a women's rights lawyer, but grew tired of focusing only on the fallout from workplace discrimination issues rather than the causes. In 2014, she launched Paradigm, a small organization that consults with businesses like Pinterest, Slack, Airbnb on building better diversity strategies. \n\nThe most common issue she sees when first meeting with these companies is as obvious as it is detrimental: there is simply no firm company-wide structure in place to determine the best way to interview job candidates, where to recruit from, how to set compensation and when to promote staffers.\n\n\"A lot of that lack of structure is going to be filled in with unconscious bias,\" Emerson says. Much of the early diversity efforts have focused on this area. \n\nFacebook tested the practice of interviewing at least one minority for certain positions to broaden the pool of candidates. \n\nLinkedIn trained managers to be more mindful of performance evaluations, recognizing that women are sometimes more reluctant to raise their hands for promotions. \n\nPinterest began reviewing all of its job postings to eliminate phrases like \"quarterback\" and \"rock star engineer,\" which may unintentionally box out female candidates. \n\nAnd Slack did away with seemingly benign interview questions (ex: \"What do you do for fun?\"), which could make candidates from certain backgrounds feel awkward.\n\nFor better or worse, nearly all the tech companies we spoke with have also done some form of unconscious bias training internally, which seek in a matter of hours to make staff members more aware of unintentional prejudices they've carried for years.  \n\n\"Unconscious bias training is the hot thing right now. If you look at the research, there's not much saying that training them to know they are biased will make them unbiased,\" says Katherine Phillips, senior vice dean and a professor of leadership at Columbia Business School. Emerson counters that training can at least get staff to \"act differently\" even if they don't \"think differently.\"\n\nDiversity 2.0\n\nProgress on the diversity front has been remarkably slow going, especially for an industry accustomed to the \"move fast and break things\" philosophy Facebook once touted as its motto.\n\nApple, for example, saw the percentage of black and female employees grow by just 1% each from 2014 to 2015. \n\n\"The bigger you get, the harder it becomes to put the ingredients in place,\" Emerson says, expressing optimism for the precedent set by young businesses like Slack.\"The earlier you start, you’re not having to go back and change processes and change culture.\" \n\nSize isn't the only problem for Silicon Valley. There are also issues of thinking too narrowly about the problem.\n\n\"Whenever we talk to tech companies, at least in our initial conversations, they immediately cite the need to build a more inclusive engineering team. That’s great, but credibly committing to diversity within a company means doing a lot more,\" says Porter Braswell, CEO and cofounder of Jopwell, a startup that helps companies recruit more diverse candidates. \"It means looking at the engineers and beyond.\"\n\nWoodard, from Black Founders, echoes Braswell's concern, noting that these companies must boost diversity among executives, not just engineers.\n\n\"If you can’t hire diverse talent at the top, it's often very difficult to hire and retain diverse talent at other levels of the organization,\" she says, \"because the talent you’re bringing in the door doesn’t see anyone who has moved up the ladder and see a future for themselves at the company.\"\n\nSilicon Valley is willing and eager to \"iterate\" more with these diversity efforts -- one of the industry's favorite words and one used by Paradigm's Emerson too -- until it shows meaningful results just as it attempts to do with products.\n\nWadors at LinkedIn admits that she has not always communicated well with the homegrown employee resource groups that represent blacks, hispanics, women and other demographics LinkedIn wants to recruit and retain. \n\nShe's now working to be clearer with them \"about their role\" helping to foster and maintain diversity.\n\nMorgan, the new diversity chief at Pinterest, touted the company's plans this year to go after underrepresented minorities through new internship and apprenticeship programs and recruiting applicants from a broader range of schools whose names don't rhyme with Manford.\n\n\"A lot of industries are saying we really care about this, and many of them are genuine, but they just don’t know what to do, so they don’t give diversity and talent programs the proper support needed to make a difference,\" Morgan says. \n\n\"If you are not actually investing in real accountability, getting leadership really looking at this as a business issue in the same way they are looking at marketing their products, there's no follow through.\""},"shares":{"facebook":543,"twitter":1191,"linked_in":1099,"google_plus":20,"pinterest":5,"total":2858},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kr1yLDnDfxZO5VSw3fcbJC3E04c=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2016%2F01%2F19%2Fc1%2Flinkedindiv.bbfa0.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KEiqDLr0N4pFiaJshQ-qUHj0GNg=/1438x0/2016%2F01%2F19%2Fc1%2Flinkedindiv.bbfa0.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/VBecSg-j2ckBPCYxvg31IrEvXxk=/356x205/2016%2F01%2F19%2Fc1%2Flinkedindiv.bbfa0.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ydJrfNG-VgNs5b6McmFJ3eB6yks=/712x410/2016%2F01%2F19%2Fc1%2Flinkedindiv.bbfa0.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gkuQbi7xRcHMtgir2AQ3QAabSxI=/280x157/2016%2F01%2F19%2Fc1%2Flinkedindiv.bbfa0.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/juuDP_nu1JUmk1aM-j3O8LDowWY=/560x314/2016%2F01%2F19%2Fc1%2Flinkedindiv.bbfa0.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1ndJrAU","display_title":"Inside Silicon Valley's struggle for diversity","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Apple, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest are all trying to make their companies welcoming to diverse candidates.

Pinterest supplied all statistics to Mashable.\n\nBullet journals\n\nThis analog organizational system wants to rid you of your 7,000 organizational apps. The customizable system is based around putting all your tasks, events and notes in one space so you can see everything in a clean layout that makes sense to you. It uses a quaint little thing called a notebook that you might not have seen since the iPhone first came into your life.  It seems almost too simple to work, but its Pinterest interest has increased by 67% so far this year. \n\nMeditation Space\n\nThis trend has seen a pinning increase of 49% in the past few weeks, and that isn't just because people were desperately trying to have some alone time during the holidays. This trend points to focusing on serenity, focus and whole-body wellness instead of just fitting into a smaller pair of pants. \n\nCloud bread\n\nNo carbs, no gluten, no flavor? That's not what cloud bread enthusiasts say and with pins up 73% so far this year, fans seem to be multiplying at record speed. The small rounds of bread are made with eggs, cheese and sweetener of some sort. Though it won't replace biscuits, it's a way to keep turkey sandwiches in your life without resorting to lettuce wraps. \n\nDry brushing\n\nA 41% pinning increase means people don't just want to eat better, they want to treat their bodies better in every way. Schirmer tells Mashable, \"proponents of this treatment will tell you that dry brushing the skin in a certain pattern with a dry brush before showering helps release your body's toxins,\" by unclogging pores. All you  need is a natural bristled brush, a circular brushing motion and enough time to enjoy the experience. \n\nJiu jitsu\n\nThis martial arts form has been pinned 39% more this year than last year, thus far. This term can encompass the Japanese, Brazilian and German forms of the art. Jiu jitsu not only burns calories and raises your heart rate, but is useful for self defense. Plus, it makes you feel like a badass.\n\nGoing minimal\n\nThis concept has increased in pins 19% in one month and its cousin \"declutter\" has increased 35%. The idea of taking stock of what one really needs to be happy was a huge deal in 2015 thanks in part to Japanese organizational superstar Marie Kondo and the trend continues to rise in popularity.  With the excess of the 1980s and the gadget obsession of the 1990s in the past, people are now embracing a simpler lifestyle in an effort to make life more enjoyable and meaningful."},"shares":{"facebook":269,"twitter":816,"linked_in":10,"google_plus":17,"pinterest":30,"total":1142},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RFWaQ9WxFJLeoqzViQkN3AGG9S4=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/2016%2F01%2F08%2F06%2Fmeditating.68f5f.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AoDjyjjtZLkViLoHXQMTMCj0gOI=/1438x0/2016%2F01%2F08%2F06%2Fmeditating.68f5f.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nmjWDlgexSNVfgVBRgTBttvQMmE=/356x205/2016%2F01%2F08%2F06%2Fmeditating.68f5f.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1HlWMFB3jzHMelNx0IjW54SUpME=/712x410/2016%2F01%2F08%2F06%2Fmeditating.68f5f.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/QokfdwzJwGb2bOtkGtxLpv_PpTg=/280x157/2016%2F01%2F08%2F06%2Fmeditating.68f5f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/j7TxHRhambk6Qi4sufUFA1DfmAw=/560x314/2016%2F01%2F08%2F06%2Fmeditating.68f5f.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1mIqZ31","display_title":"The 2016 health and wellness trends, according to Pinterest","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/12/06/food-trends-2016/"}],"wp_shortcode_manager":[{}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Have fun burning your library of \"Get Skinny Quick\" books.
