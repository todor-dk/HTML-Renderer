						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>This article provides a simple way to choose between
						<em>you and I</em> and <em>you and me</em>.
					</div>

					<P>Consider the following sentence: <em>You and I should have lunch.</em>

					<P>Is the correct form of this sentence <em>You and I ...</em> or <em>You and me ...</em>? This is a common source of
					confusion in English.

					<P>Fortunately, there's an easy way to decide whether to use <em>I</em> or <em>me</em> in such sentences. All you have to
					do is drop the word <em>you</em> then try the sentence with <em>I</em> and <em>me</em> one at a time. For example:
					<p class="indented">I should have lunch.
					<p class="indented">Me should have lunch.


					<P>Clearly the preferred form in this case is <em>I</em>; thus, the original sentence was
					correct to use <em>you and I.</em>

					<P>Here's another example: <em>He'll blame you and I.</em> Drop the word
					<em>you</em> then try the sentence with <em>I</em> and <em>me</em> one at a time, like so:
					<p class="indented">He'll blame I.
					<p class="indented">He'll blame me.

					<P>You can see that the second of these is correct. This means that the original sentence
					should have been: <em>He'll blame you and me.</em>

					<P>Easy.


					<P>On a related note, when using phrases such as <em>you and me</em>, <em>you
					and I</em> or <em>them and us</em>, it has traditionally been considered courteous to place the
					reference to yourself last. For example, we prefer:

					<p class="indented">He'll ask you and me later.

					<P>over:
					<p class="indented">He'll ask me and you later.
