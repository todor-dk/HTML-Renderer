Because it is a few years old, its lines are leaner than those of current models, which have been expanded to accommodate the modern habit of perching a laptop on the armrest.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="177"><em class="small" data-reactid="178"><!-- react-text: 179 -->KIVIK<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 180 -->—along with a profusion of things I use every day—is made by <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="181"><!-- react-text: 182 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 183 -->, the Swedish home-furnishings company. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="184"><!-- react-text: 185 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 186 --> has three hundred and twenty-six stores in thirty-eight countries.

When <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="190"><!-- react-text: 191 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 192 --> stopped selling incandescent light bulbs, last year, six hundred and twenty-six million people became environmentalists.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="193"><!-- react-text: 194 -->The prevalence of <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="195"><!-- react-text: 196 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 197 --> in my apartment is more the result of circumstance than of desire or discernment. Since graduating from college, nine years ago, I have moved eight times, propelled by the usual vicissitudes of money, romance, and work. My first encounter with <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="198"><!-- react-text: 199 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 200 --> was in the freshman-year dormitory, where I marvelled at the profligacy of classmates who, that September, and each one thereafter, ordered a new couch from <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="201"><!-- react-text: 202 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 203 -->—and paid the ninety-nine-dollar delivery fee! (My roommates and I settled for a hand-me-down, which we covered with a sleeping bag and doused in Febreze.) By the time I was a senior, I had my own room and had acquired my first piece of <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="204"><!-- react-text: 205 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 206 --> furniture, an only slightly shopworn navy-blue love seat. A shared apartment in Manhattan followed. It suffered from a plight that <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="207"><!-- react-text: 208 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 209 --> has acknowledged in an internal report titled “Life in Rental Accommodation”: the tragedy of the common room is that it often is a dump. There were several apartments in the West Village, and one, farther south, in which my parents and I spent a long night trying to assemble an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="210"><!-- react-text: 211 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 212 --> bookshelf with the guidance of only a stick man with a mute smirk. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="213"><!-- react-text: 214 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 215 --> omits words from instruction booklets, because words make instruction booklets thicker, which makes them more expensive. The screws strip easily. Amy Poehler once said that <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="216"><!-- react-text: 217 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 218 --> is Swedish for “argument.” In Tribeca, I pridefully refused <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="219"><!-- react-text: 220 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 221 -->, like a child announcing that she no longer plays with dolls. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="222"><!-- react-text: 223 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 224 --> can also be Swedish for feeling like you’re never going to grow up.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="225"><!-- react-text: 226 -->The apartment I live in now is a rental in west London. Like many rentals here, it comes furnished—which means that, instead of your having to go to <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="227"><!-- react-text: 228 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 229 --> and get the stuff yourself, the landlord goes to <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="230"><!-- react-text: 231 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 232 --> and gets it for you. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="233"><!-- react-text: 234 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 235 --> offers more than nine thousand products, divided into four “style groups”: Traditional, Scandinavian, Modern, and Popular. (These are subdivided into such categories as Continental Dark, Continental Light, Contemporary, and Ethnic.) I moved into the London apartment in January. The person I live with had added to the mostly Modern infrastructure a few personal touches, for an effect one might call Itinerant Indifferent: a picture frame with no picture, various gifts from his mother, no knife that could penetrate meat. I put the picture frame in a drawer. The knives I cared enough about to buy a decent set from a department store. In a paper called “On the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="236"><!-- react-text: 237 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 238 -->nization of France,” a sociologist named Tod Hartman suggests that <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="239"><!-- react-text: 240 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 241 --> resolves the conundrum posed by Georges Perec in his 1965 novel, “Les Choses,” about a young couple consumed with unhappiness at the discrepancy between the dismal home they have and the tasteful one they think they deserve. “Question your teaspoons,” Perec later wrote.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="242"><!-- react-text: 243 -->Eventually, we drove to the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="244"><!-- react-text: 245 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 246 --> store in Wembley, where we picked out some throw pillows and a phalaenopsis orchid. We liked the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="247"><!-- react-text: 248 -->SNÄRTIG<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 249 --> bud vase, the surface of which is dotted with tiny bubbles, like eyelet lace. It cost fifty-nine pence, which makes it what <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="250"><!-- react-text: 251 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 252 --> calls a “breathtaking item”—so affordable that you can’t afford not to buy it. We took two. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="253"><!-- react-text: 254 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 255 --> offers the serendipity of the yard sale without the mothballs.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="256"><!-- react-text: 257 -->Bill Moggridge, the director of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in New York, calls <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="258"><!-- react-text: 259 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 260 -->’s aesthetic “global functional minimalism.” He said, “It’s modernist, and it’s very neutral in order to avoid local preferences, to get the economies of scale they need in order to keep the prices good.” <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="261"><!-- react-text: 262 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 263 --> products are intended to work as well in Riyadh as they do in Reykjavík.

Last year, <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="264"><!-- react-text: 265 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 266 -->’s business in China, where it has eight stores, grew by twenty per cent. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="267"><!-- react-text: 268 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 269 --> sells a few products (water fountains, chopsticks, mosquito nets) tailored to a Chinese clientele, but ninety-five per cent of the product range is standard. It is said that one in ten Europeans is conceived in an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="270"><!-- react-text: 271 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 272 --> bed.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="273"><!-- react-text: 274 -->People have cared intensely about the decoration of their houses since cavemen began painting on walls.

Are we to hang our hearts on such little things? Yes, and without hesitation.<!-- /react-text --></p></blockquote><p data-reactid="278"><!-- react-text: 279 -->Our curio cabinets and chesterfield sofas are the backdrops of domesticity, forming the unchanging indoor landscape—mahogany mountains, meadows of chintz—against which we go about life. Choosing a piece of furniture was once a serious decision, because of the expectation that it was permanent. It is said that Americans keep sofas longer than they keep cars, and change dining-room tables about as often as they trade spouses. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="280"><!-- react-text: 281 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 282 --> has made interiors ephemeral. Its furniture is placeholder furniture, the prelude to an always imminent upgrade. It works until it breaks, or until its owners break up. It carries no traces. (Jonathan Coulton’s song “<!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="283"><!-- react-text: 284 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 285 -->”: “Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen / Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men.”) In David Fincher’s 1999 movie, “Fight Club,” the character played by Edward Norton flips through an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="286"><!-- react-text: 287 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 288 --> catalogue while sitting on the toilet. “Like so many others, I had become a slave to the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="289"><!-- react-text: 290 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 291 --> nesting instinct,” he says, in a voice-over. “If I saw something clever, like a little coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.” The ease of self-invention that <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="292"><!-- react-text: 293 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 294 --> enables is liberating, but it can be sad to be able to make a life, or to dispose of it, so cheaply.<!-- /react-text --></p><div class="Callout__feature-small___1KziP" data-type="callout" data-callout="feature-small" data-reactid="295"><div class="ImageEmbed__container___1S6AV " data-reactid="296"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te Figure__fullHeight___3uICS " data-reactid="297"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl Figure__image___1hDvt ImageEmbed__image___VwXNk" role="false" tabindex="false" data-reactid="298"><div class="component-lazy pending" data-component="Lazy" data-reactid="299"></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI  ImageCaption__default___3TPB5" data-reactid="300"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO" data-reactid="301"><p>Ingvar Kamprad holding an ÖGLA café chair, launched in 1961. <em class="credit">Courtesy IKEA</em></p>

In recent months, middle-aged singles have taken to congregating in a Shanghai <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="315"><!-- react-text: 316 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 317 --> in such numbers that management has been forced to cordon off a designated “match-making corner.” Shen Jinhua, an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="318"><!-- react-text: 319 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 320 --> employee, told the <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="321"><!-- react-text: 322 -->Shanghai Daily<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 323 -->, “Before we set up an isolated area for them, they occupied the seats in the dining area for a long time, and thus other guests could not find a seat.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="324"><!-- react-text: 325 -->Each <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="326"><!-- react-text: 327 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 328 --> store is carefully laid out to stimulate certain behaviors. Johan Stenebo, who worked at <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="329"><!-- react-text: 330 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 331 --> for twenty years, writes in “The Truth About <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="332"><!-- react-text: 333 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 334 -->” (2009), “One could describe it as if <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="335"><!-- react-text: 336 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 337 --> grabs you by the hand and consciously guides you through the store in order to make you buy as much as possible.” In June, I visited <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="338"><!-- react-text: 339 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 340 -->’s new store in Hyllie, a suburb of the Swedish city of Malmö. The store, which opened in September, 2010, is <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="341"><!-- react-text: 342 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 343 -->’s “everyday best practice” store. Martin Albrecht, the store’s manager, agreed to give me a tour of the premises. “All the knowledge and wisdom of our stores is built into this one,” he said.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="344"><!-- react-text: 345 -->A bin of blue-and-yellow tarpaulin bags stood at the store’s entrance. Albrecht explained that a customer, wherever he is, should always be able to see the next bin of bags. We were standing on the gray path that guides customers through an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="346"><!-- react-text: 347 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 348 --> store. “We call this the Main Aisle,” Albrecht said. “You should feel safe that you can walk it and you won’t miss anything.” The Main Aisle is supposed to curve every fifty feet or so, to keep the customer interested. A path that is straight for any longer than that is called an Autobahn—a big, boring mistake. Those customers who would like to veer off the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="349"><!-- react-text: 350 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 351 -->-approved route often cannot find the exit. <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="352"><!-- react-text: 353 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 354 --> stores have secret doors, like those in “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”: one can step through them and go directly from Living Rooms (which an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="355"><!-- react-text: 356 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 357 --> store always starts with) to Children’s Rooms (“Cots are our ticket to building a lifelong relationship with our core customers,” according to an internal report) without having to look at two hundred bath mats on the way.

In a letter that prefaces “A Furniture Dealer’s Testament,” the company’s constitutional text, Ingvar Kamprad, <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="409"><!-- react-text: 410 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 411 -->’s founder, wrote, “A well-known industrialist/politician once said that <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="412"><!-- react-text: 413 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 414 --> has had a greater impact on the democratization process than many political measures combined.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="415"><!-- react-text: 416 -->The capital of <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="417"><!-- react-text: 418 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 419 --> is Älmhult, a small village on Sweden’s southern peninsula.

Älmhult lies halfway between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, in Småland, a remote region of barren, rocky flatland. Smålanders are known, more or less, as the Scots of Sweden. Faced with the area’s harsh winters and lack of arable soil, many of them immigrated to Minnesota in the nineteenth century. Those who didn’t are renowned for their obstinacy and thrift. The Småland ethos is central to <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="423"><!-- react-text: 424 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 425 -->’s self-mythology. “Like Småland’s farmers, our values are down-to-earth,” an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="426"><!-- react-text: 427 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 428 --> ad from 1981 read. “We have toiled hard in a difficult field to produce sweet harvests.” Clogs and a lip full of <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="429"><!-- react-text: 430 -->snus<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 431 --> are still the favored uniform of Kamprad loyalists.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="432"><!-- react-text: 433 -->Kamprad’s paternal grandparents, Achim and Franziska, arrived in Småland in the winter of 1896. Immigrants from Germany, they had bought a timber estate of four hundred and forty-nine hectares near Agunnaryd, about twelve miles from Älmhult, after seeing an advertisement in the back of a hunting magazine. They established a farm there. They didn’t speak Swedish. The farm, called Elmtaryd, foundered. In the spring of 1897, after the local savings bank rejected his loan application, Achim Kamprad shot his hounds and then killed himself. His widow continued to run the farm, which in 1918 passed to her eldest son, Feodor. He married the daughter of the proprietor of the area’s biggest country store, “the old kind with four or five assistants, the smell of herring and toffees and leather,” as Ingvar Kamprad described it to Bertil Torekull in his authorized biography, “Leading by Design,” published in 1998. Ingvar was born in 1926. At Elmtaryd, Torekull writes, “the silence is still more likely to be broken by the bark of a roebuck than the sound of a tractor or a car.” I.-B. Bayley, a Kamprad cousin, recalled young Ingvar’s life there:<!-- /react-text --></p><blockquote data-reactid="434"><p data-reactid="435"><!-- react-text: 436 -->We taught him to dance to the gramophone beneath the thick foliage of the oaks down by the church. . . .

The cover featured an image of a stone wall built in the Småland style, along with a head shot of Kamprad, like a Mao or a Padre Pio. Kamprad has said that he engineered his first business deal at the age of five, when he contracted with an aunt in Stockholm to buy a hundred boxes of matches. “Then I sold the boxes at two or three öre each, sometimes even five öre,” Kamprad told Torekull. “Talk about profit margins, but I still remember the lovely feeling.” Eventually, Kamprad branched out into Christmas cards and wall hangings. He caught fish and picked lingonberries. At eleven, he made a killing in garden seeds. As Kamprad tells it, he was an Agunnarydian Iacocca: “In my last year at middle school, my first rather childish business was beginning to look rather like a real firm.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="455"><!-- react-text: 456 -->Kamprad founded <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="457"><!-- react-text: 458 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 459 --> at his uncle Ernst’s kitchen table, in 1943. (The “I” is for “Ingvar,” the “K” is for “Kamprad,” the “E” is for “Elmtaryd,” and the “A” is for “Agunnaryd.”) He sold fountain pens, encyclopedias, table runners, udder balm, reinforced socks. In 1948, in imitation of a competitor, he added furniture to his portfolio. The business was mostly mail-order: at six-fifty every morning, the milk bus came by the farm’s churn stand and picked up goods that had been ordered, carrying them on to the train station. In 1949, Kamprad published a circular in the national farmers’ newspaper. His appeal, “To the People of the Countryside,” read:<!-- /react-text --></p><blockquote data-reactid="460"><p data-reactid="461"><!-- react-text: 462 -->You may have noticed that it is not easy to make ends meet.

In 1952, Kamprad bought a joinery in Älmhult—his grandfather’s general store had once occupied the site—and set up a showroom, where people could come and see the goods. “At that moment, the basis of the modern <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="469"><!-- react-text: 470 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 471 --> concept was created, and in principle it still applies: first and foremost, use a catalogue to tempt people to come to an exhibition, which today is our store,” Kamprad later said.

Abandoned crofts bordered wooden cottages painted Sweden’s traditional Falu red. Two and a half hours later, I reached Älmhult’s station. The town was quiet, as though a storm had just blown through. I walked across the tracks and, in five minutes, arrived at what is known as the “<!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="481"><!-- react-text: 482 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 483 --> village”: a large parking lot surrounded by <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="484"><!-- react-text: 485 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 486 --> corporate offices, an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="487"><!-- react-text: 488 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 489 --> store, a museum, and an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="490"><!-- react-text: 491 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 492 --> hotel.

According to an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="499"><!-- react-text: 500 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 501 --> brochure, “At first sight, Älmhult seems very normal.

Visiting the store at Wembley one day, I came across an interesting item: a black half-moon of polypropylene, with a gray beanbag-ish underbelly. Inspection revealed that it was <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="943"><!-- react-text: 944 -->BRÄDA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 945 -->, a “laptop support.” The TV tray of our moment, <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="946"><!-- react-text: 947 -->BRÄDA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 948 --> was developed in 2004 by Hanna Ahlberg, then a student at Lund Technical University.

The <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="974"><!-- react-text: 975 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 976 --> catalogue is a self-help manual for a certain kind of life.

Selin Hult, an information manager, and Henrik Palmberg, who said he was a “competence matrix owner,” showed me around. We enjoyed <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="985"><!-- react-text: 986 -->fika<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 987 -->, the Swedish coffee break, with summer cake and mugs of tea, and then set off on a tour. First, we walked through a vast warehouse lined with towering racks of <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="988"><!-- react-text: 989 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 990 --> products—a sort of furniture lending library, where an interior designer can check out whatever crib or dresser he needs. It looked as though an entire high-rise had disgorged its contents. All around us, I could see three-sided rooms, like sitcom sets. “At full capacity, we can do twenty-five at once,” Palmberg said.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="991"><!-- react-text: 992 -->In a far corner, a room set had been built and furnished to resemble a bed-and-breakfast in the Swedish countryside. Whenever an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="993"><!-- react-text: 994 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 995 --> designer creates a room set, for the catalogue or in a store, he or she writes up a detailed treatment. The treatment for the bed-and-breakfast read, “Story: a weekend hobby that turned into a full-time business, this B. and B. is nestled in the countryside untroubled by tourists. It is popular among those taking a break from the city and looking for peace and quiet. Despite its rural setting, this B. and B. is tastefully decorated to appeal to its urban guests.” The room’s designer, Sara Bohlin, had appointed the time of day “Morning/Breakfast.” The price, “Medium.” She had even mocked up a brochure for the place, which she had named Alanda. She was still putting on final touches. “I’m in a bit of a panic,” she said.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="996"><!-- react-text: 997 -->The kitchen looked rustically inviting, with wide white floorboards and white walls. The focal point was a large <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="998"><!-- react-text: 999 -->STORNÄS<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1000 --> dining table, in gray, with <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1001"><!-- react-text: 1002 -->STEFAN<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1003 --> chairs and a <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1004"><!-- react-text: 1005 -->MÅNLJUS<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1006 --> pendant lamp. There were board games and a stack of woollen blankets on shelves, for the guests. A spotlight simulated a beam of morning light hitting the table. (You will find three types of lighting schemes in the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1007"><!-- react-text: 1008 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1009 --> catalogue: Let the Sun In, Lamps Lit, and Middle of the Day.) A carpenter had installed a real wood-burning stove, which the designer had found, into a “brick” hearth made of plywood. On the table sat a ceramic milk pitcher. To complete the tableau, Bohlin had gone out to fetch fresh bread and marmalade.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1010"><!-- react-text: 1011 -->Just as the goal of a real room is to look like a fake one, the goal of a fake room is to look like a real one. At the catalogue headquarters, Hult and Palmberg showed me into a large room filled with kitchen supplies. I marvelled at bins of plastic food: mushrooms, strawberries, apples, lemons, bell peppers, bunches of green grapes. “When we go close, we go fresh,” Palmberg said. “Otherwise, we go fake.” A loaf of sourdough in the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1012"><!-- react-text: 1013 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1014 --> catalogue will have a slice taken out.

You’ll see a friendly golden retriever curled up by the dining-room table in the British catalogue, but not in the Emirati one. Europeans like to sit on their furniture while Americans prefer to sit <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="1023"><!-- react-text: 1024 -->in<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1025 --> it. “A Swedish bed should be soft and inviting and open, so that you almost want to crawl in,” Hult explained. (Despite the influx of duvets in the seventies, most Americans remain wedded to the top sheet.) In the kitchen-supplies room, I counted fifteen coffee machines. Hult said, “For example, in Sweden we brew our own coffee, but perhaps if it’s in Italy you want an espresso machine. It’s these things that can make a difference. Small things, but quite important.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1026"><em class="small" data-reactid="1027"><!-- react-text: 1028 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1029 --> believes that it can make your sleep better and that it can enhance your family life.

The pedagogical impulse can get a bit overweening. “We want to be the leader in life at home,” Albrecht told me, in Malmö. “Not just be the leader in home furnishings, but show you how to live!” A few minutes later, he was pointing out an item that, he said, had not sold very well, because <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1039"><!-- react-text: 1040 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1041 --> had not sufficiently illuminated its use. “If you don’t show the customer the function, the customer won’t understand it,” he said.

In hindsight, I know that early on I should have included this in my fiascos, but that is now spilled milk.” The employees responded with a letter, signed by hundreds. “Ingvar, we are here whenever you need us.” Bertil Torekull, Kamprad’s handpicked biographer, writes, “Then the father of the family broke down and wept like a child.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1127"><!-- react-text: 1128 -->After more revelations of Nazi associations, Kamprad wrote an apology, which appeared in Torekull’s book, in a section entitled “A Youth and His Errors.” He explained that, growing up at Elmtaryd, he had been especially close to his grandmother, Grossmutter Franziska, who was from the Sudetenland. (Torekull writes that Kamprad didn’t come clean about all of his Nazi affiliations, because he had forgotten about them.) Kamprad concludes the chapter by asking, “As I have lain awake at night pondering this dismal affair, I have asked myself: when is an old man forgiven for the sins of his youth? Is it a crime that I was brought up by a German grandmother and a German father?”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1129"><!-- react-text: 1130 -->Still, Kamprad enjoys a hero’s status in Sweden. “Everything that is about Ingvar Kamprad is big news,” Fredrik Sjöshult, a reporter for <!-- /react-text --><em data-reactid="1131"><!-- react-text: 1132 -->Expressen<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1133 -->, told me. “He’s lived, like our version of the American dream, the Swedish dream.” Last year, the Malmö City Theatre premièred “Ingvar! A Musical Furniture Saga.” In the production, the Kamprad character is crucified on a Maypole. He sings, “Do you think this can stop Ingvar?”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1134"><!-- react-text: 1135 -->In 2009, Sweden’s largest television station, SVT, revealed that <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1136"><!-- react-text: 1137 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1138 -->’s money—the three per cent collected from each store—does not actually go to a charitable foundation in Holland, as <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1139"><!-- react-text: 1140 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1141 --> had led people to believe. Rather, as Magnus Svenungsson reported, Inter <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1142"><!-- react-text: 1143 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1144 --> is owned by a foundation in Liechtenstein, called Interogo, a corporate rainy-day fund.

With his second wife, Margaretha, Kamprad has three sons, Peter, Jonas, and Matthias. None has any public profile. None has distinguished himself particularly within the company. In earlier years, Kamprad spoke of a sort of battle royal in which the son who proved himself most capable would inherit control of the company. More recently, he and his associates have suggested that none of them possess sufficient mettle.<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1149"><em class="small" data-reactid="1150"><!-- react-text: 1151 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1152 --> would tell me only, “Peter, Jonas, and Matthias Kamprad will continue to occupy important board positions and actively participate in the future governance of the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1153"><!-- react-text: 1154 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1155 --> sphere companies. How they will exactly divide up the roles among them is under discussion.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1156"><!-- react-text: 1157 -->Even Bertil Torekull, who has likened Kamprad, as a leader, to “some venerable African freedom fighter,” admitted that Kamprad’s reluctance to anoint a successor endangered the stability of <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1158"><!-- react-text: 1159 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1160 -->. “What he’s doing is risky,” Torekull told me. “It’s definitely time that other people must be more decisive or play a larger role.” He concluded, “Anything can happen when the strong Ingvar Kamprad is gone.”<!-- /react-text --></p><p data-reactid="1161"><!-- react-text: 1162 -->Kamprad’s legacy in the dining room has never been in question. The Sunday that I bummed around on my living-room couch, I went over to a friend’s house for lunch. She served lamb on an <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1163"><!-- react-text: 1164 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1165 --> platter and poured wine into <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1166"><!-- react-text: 1167 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1168 --> wineglasses like the ones that I had earlier neglected to wash. At the end of September, she’s moving in with her boyfriend. She wrote to me, “I’m really torn about the <!-- /react-text --><em class="small" data-reactid="1169"><!-- react-text: 1170 -->IKEA<!-- /react-text --></em><!-- react-text: 1171 --> question. Inevitably, there will be a trip there, but I’m actually really keen to take a bit more time this time around, and not do the ‘quick fix house kit-out’ and try and get some more bits and pieces from antique auctions and so on. But, then, who has the time and the patience (and the money!) to do that?” ♦<!-- /react-text --></p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ" data-reactid="1172"><!-- react-empty: 1173 --><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk" data-reactid="1174"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ" data-reactid="1175"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0" data-reactid="1176"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/lauren-collins" data-reactid="1177"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="false" tabindex="false" data-reactid="1178"><picture class="component-responsive-image" data-reactid="1179"><source srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b7a019dfc3494ea36df/1:1/w_130,c_limit/collins-lauren.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b7a019dfc3494ea36df/1:1/w_260,c_limit/collins-lauren.png 2x" data-reactid="1180"/><img srcset="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b7a019dfc3494ea36df/1:1/w_130,c_limit/collins-lauren.png" data-reactid="1181"/></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false" data-reactid="1182"><li data-reactid="1183"><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB" data-reactid="1184">Lauren Collins began working at <em>The New Yorker</em> in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.

I smoothed the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"DVALA"]," fitted sheet and tucked the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"HENNY CIRKEL"]," quilt beneath four pillows sheathed in matching polka-dot cases. In the kitchen, some lettuce clung to the meniscus of a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"BLANDA BLANK"]," salad bowl. Rouged ",["em",{"class":"small"},"RÄTTVIK"]," wineglasses and dirty ",["em",{"class":"small"},"DRAGON"]," forks waited to be washed. In the living room, I sat down on the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"KIVIK"]," sofa.

",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," has three hundred and twenty-six stores in thirty-eight countries. In the fiscal year 2010, it sold $23.1 billion worth of goods, a 7.7-per-cent increase over the year before. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," calls itself the Life Improvement Store. The invisible designer of domestic life, it not only reflects but also molds, in its ubiquity, our routines and our attitudes. When ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," stopped selling incandescent light bulbs, last year, six hundred and twenty-six million people became environmentalists."],["p","The prevalence of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," in my apartment is more the result of circumstance than of desire or discernment. Since graduating from college, nine years ago, I have moved eight times, propelled by the usual vicissitudes of money, romance, and work. My first encounter with ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," was in the freshman-year dormitory, where I marvelled at the profligacy of classmates who, that September, and each one thereafter, ordered a new couch from ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"—and paid the ninety-nine-dollar delivery fee! (My roommates and I settled for a hand-me-down, which we covered with a sleeping bag and doused in Febreze.) By the time I was a senior, I had my own room and had acquired my first piece of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," furniture, an only slightly shopworn navy-blue love seat. A shared apartment in Manhattan followed. It suffered from a plight that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," has acknowledged in an internal report titled “Life in Rental Accommodation”: the tragedy of the common room is that it often is a dump. There were several apartments in the West Village, and one, farther south, in which my parents and I spent a long night trying to assemble an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," bookshelf with the guidance of only a stick man with a mute smirk. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," omits words from instruction booklets, because words make instruction booklets thicker, which makes them more expensive. The screws strip easily. Amy Poehler once said that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," is Swedish for “argument.” In Tribeca, I pridefully refused ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],", like a child announcing that she no longer plays with dolls. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," can also be Swedish for feeling like you’re never going to grow up."],["p","The apartment I live in now is a rental in west London. Like many rentals here, it comes furnished—which means that, instead of your having to go to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," and get the stuff yourself, the landlord goes to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," and gets it for you. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," offers more than nine thousand products, divided into four “style groups”: Traditional, Scandinavian, Modern, and Popular. (These are subdivided into such categories as Continental Dark, Continental Light, Contemporary, and Ethnic.) I moved into the London apartment in January. The person I live with had added to the mostly Modern infrastructure a few personal touches, for an effect one might call Itinerant Indifferent: a picture frame with no picture, various gifts from his mother, no knife that could penetrate meat. I put the picture frame in a drawer. The knives I cared enough about to buy a decent set from a department store. In a paper called “On the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"nization of France,” a sociologist named Tod Hartman suggests that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," resolves the conundrum posed by Georges Perec in his 1965 novel, “Les Choses,” about a young couple consumed with unhappiness at the discrepancy between the dismal home they have and the tasteful one they think they deserve. “Question your teaspoons,” Perec later wrote."],["p","Eventually, we drove to the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store in Wembley, where we picked out some throw pillows and a phalaenopsis orchid. We liked the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"SNÄRTIG"]," bud vase, the surface of which is dotted with tiny bubbles, like eyelet lace. It cost fifty-nine pence, which makes it what ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," calls a “breathtaking item”—so affordable that you can’t afford not to buy it. We took two. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," offers the serendipity of the yard sale without the mothballs."],["p","Bill Moggridge, the director of the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in New York, calls ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s aesthetic “global functional minimalism.” He said, “It’s modernist, and it’s very neutral in order to avoid local preferences, to get the economies of scale they need in order to keep the prices good.” ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," products are intended to work as well in Riyadh as they do in Reykjavík. (Pigs and skeletons, for example, are banned motifs.) Last year, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s business in China, where it has eight stores, grew by twenty per cent. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," sells a few products (water fountains, chopsticks, mosquito nets) tailored to a Chinese clientele, but ninety-five per cent of the product range is standard. It is said that one in ten Europeans is conceived in an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," bed."],["p","People have cared intensely about the decoration of their houses since cavemen began painting on walls. We are attached to our belongings because they are vessels for our memories and for our aspirations. Freud wrote to Martha, his future wife, during their engagement:"],["blockquote",["p","Tables and chairs, beds, mirrors, a clock to remind the happy couple of the passage of time, an armchair for an hour’s pleasant daydreaming, carpets to help the housewife keep the floors clean, linen tied with pretty ribbons in the cupboard and dresses of the latest fashion and hats with artificial flowers, pictures on the wall, glasses for everyday and others for wine and festive occasions. . . . Are we to hang our hearts on such little things? Yes, and without hesitation."]],["p","Our curio cabinets and chesterfield sofas are the backdrops of domesticity, forming the unchanging indoor landscape—mahogany mountains, meadows of chintz—against which we go about life. Choosing a piece of furniture was once a serious decision, because of the expectation that it was permanent. It is said that Americans keep sofas longer than they keep cars, and change dining-room tables about as often as they trade spouses. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," has made interiors ephemeral. Its furniture is placeholder furniture, the prelude to an always imminent upgrade. It works until it breaks, or until its owners break up. It carries no traces. (Jonathan Coulton’s song “",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"”: “Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen / Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men.”) In David Fincher’s 1999 movie, “Fight Club,” the character played by Edward Norton flips through an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue while sitting on the toilet. “Like so many others, I had become a slave to the

stores, like Chihuahuas and cilantro, provoke extreme reactions. Some people, such as the members of the “Official ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," Is Hell on Earth” Facebook group, can’t stand them. Others treat ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," as a human-size doll house, hanging around its prettily furnished rooms just for entertainment. In recent months, middle-aged singles have taken to congregating in a Shanghai ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," in such numbers that management has been forced to cordon off a designated “match-making corner.” Shen Jinhua, an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," employee, told the ",["em","Shanghai Daily"],", “Before we set up an isolated area for them, they occupied the seats in the dining area for a long time, and thus other guests could not find a seat.”"],["p","Each ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store is carefully laid out to stimulate certain behaviors. Johan Stenebo, who worked at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," for twenty years, writes in “The Truth About ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"” (2009), “One could describe it as if ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," grabs you by the hand and consciously guides you through the store in order to make you buy as much as possible.” In June, I visited ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s new store in Hyllie, a suburb of the Swedish city of Malmö. The store, which opened in September, 2010, is ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s “everyday best practice” store. Martin Albrecht, the store’s manager, agreed to give me a tour of the premises. “All the knowledge and wisdom of our stores is built into this one,” he said."],["p","A bin of blue-and-yellow tarpaulin bags stood at the store’s entrance. Albrecht explained that a customer, wherever he is, should always be able to see the next bin of bags. We were standing on the gray path that guides customers through an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store. “We call this the Main Aisle,” Albrecht said. “You should feel safe that you can walk it and you won’t miss anything.” The Main Aisle is supposed to curve every fifty feet or so, to keep the customer interested. A path that is straight for any longer than that is called an Autobahn—a big, boring mistake. Those customers who would like to veer off the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"-approved route often cannot find the exit. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," stores have secret doors, like those in “The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe”: one can step through them and go directly from Living Rooms (which an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store always starts with) to Children’s Rooms (“Cots are our ticket to building a lifelong relationship with our core customers,” according to an internal report) without having to look at two hundred bath mats on the way. But the hidden portals are almost impossible to find: if sticky eyeballs are the metric of success on the Internet, then ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," rules sticky feet. Alan Penn, a professor of architectural and urban computing at University College London, conducted a study of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," labyrinth and deemed it sadomasochistic. The only comparably vast shopping environment he could think of, he told the London ",["em","Times"],", was the Bazaar of Isfahan, a seventeenth-century Persian marketplace."],["p","Albrecht, an affably earnest man in a blue-and-yellow polo shirt, led the way past several room sets. In the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue, the rooms are always perfectly done, but in stores the quality of their execution varies. Design experts love ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s products but consider going to retrieve them a necessary evil. Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan, a co-founder of the blog Apartment Therapy, praised ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," for “the inventiveness of their designs” and “the usability of their furniture,” but, he added, “A brand-new ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store that’s fully stocked can be a happy place, but one that’s been trampled by the crowds on a Saturday is an ugly place to be.”"],["p","At the Malmö store, Albrecht and I ran into Gabrielle Granath and Linda Eriksson, who were tidying a room set."],["p","“We find things all over the place,” Granath said. “We find trash in the trash bins.”"],["p","“Sometimes in the toilets,” Eriksson added."],["p","Granath and Eriksson explained that their job was to keep the room sets looking fresh. They change the slipcovers once a week. They cut wicks on candles and dust fake computer screens. They make sure that all the price tags aim to the left."],["p","Albrecht indicated a box of green fleece blankets, meant to complement a couch on display. “This we would call an ‘add-on,’ ” he explained. Add-ons are not the only way that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," encourages what it refers to, internally, as “unplanned purchasing.” When we reached the Market Hall section of the store, where ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," sells pots, pans, and other lightweight items, Albrecht declared, “Now it’s the famous Open the Wallet section.” There, an abundance of cheap goods—flowerpots, slippers, lint rollers—encourages the customer to make a purchase, any purchase, the thinking being that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," shoppers buy either nothing or a lot. There is art in the visual merchandising, too.

constitutes a sort of borderless nation-state, with seats of power, redoubts of conservatism, second cities, imperial outposts, creative hubs, and administrative backwaters. In a letter that prefaces “A Furniture Dealer’s Testament,” the company’s constitutional text, Ingvar Kamprad, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s founder, wrote, “A well-known industrialist/politician once said that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," has had a greater impact on the democratization process than many political measures combined.”"],["p","The capital of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," is Älmhult, a small village on Sweden’s southern peninsula. Kamprad, who is eighty-five, opened the first ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store there, in 1953. Älmhult lies halfway between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, in Småland, a remote region of barren, rocky flatland. Smålanders are known, more or less, as the Scots of Sweden. Faced with the area’s harsh winters and lack of arable soil, many of them immigrated to Minnesota in the nineteenth century. Those who didn’t are renowned for their obstinacy and thrift. The Småland ethos is central to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s self-mythology. “Like Småland’s farmers, our values are down-to-earth,” an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," ad from 1981 read. “We have toiled hard in a difficult field to produce sweet harvests.” Clogs and a lip full of ",["em","snus"]," are still the favored uniform of Kamprad loyalists."],["p","Kamprad’s paternal grandparents, Achim and Franziska, arrived in Småland in the winter of 1896. Immigrants from Germany, they had bought a timber estate of four hundred and forty-nine hectares near Agunnaryd, about twelve miles from Älmhult, after seeing an advertisement in the back of a hunting magazine. They established a farm there. They didn’t speak Swedish. The farm, called Elmtaryd, foundered. In the spring of 1897, after the local savings bank rejected his loan application, Achim Kamprad shot his hounds and then killed himself. His widow continued to run the farm, which in 1918 passed to her eldest son, Feodor. He married the daughter of the proprietor of the area’s biggest country store, “the old kind with four or five assistants, the smell of herring and toffees and leather,” as Ingvar Kamprad described it to Bertil Torekull in his authorized biography, “Leading by Design,” published in 1998. Ingvar was born in 1926. At Elmtaryd, Torekull writes, “the silence is still more likely to be broken by the bark of a roebuck than the sound of a tractor or a car.” I.-B. Bayley, a Kamprad cousin, recalled young Ingvar’s life there:"],["blockquote",["p","We taught him to dance to the gramophone beneath the thick foliage of the oaks down by the church. . . .

The cover featured an image of a stone wall built in the Småland style, along with a head shot of Kamprad, like a Mao or a Padre Pio. Kamprad has said that he engineered his first business deal at the age of five, when he contracted with an aunt in Stockholm to buy a hundred boxes of matches. “Then I sold the boxes at two or three öre each, sometimes even five öre,” Kamprad told Torekull. “Talk about profit margins, but I still remember the lovely feeling.” Eventually, Kamprad branched out into Christmas cards and wall hangings. He caught fish and picked lingonberries. At eleven, he made a killing in garden seeds.

(The “I” is for “Ingvar,” the “K” is for “Kamprad,” the “E” is for “Elmtaryd,” and the “A” is for “Agunnaryd.”) He sold fountain pens, encyclopedias, table runners, udder balm, reinforced socks. In 1948, in imitation of a competitor, he added furniture to his portfolio. The business was mostly mail-order: at six-fifty every morning, the milk bus came by the farm’s churn stand and picked up goods that had been ordered, carrying them on to the train station. In 1949, Kamprad published a circular in the national farmers’ newspaper. His appeal, “To the People of the Countryside,” read:"],["blockquote",["p","You may have noticed that it is not easy to make ends meet. Why is this? You yourself produce goods of various kinds (milk, grain, potatoes, etc.), and I suppose you do not receive too much payment for them. No, I’m sure you don’t. And yet everything is so fantastically expensive."],["p","To a great extent, that is due to the middlemen. Compare what you receive for a kilo of pork with what the shops ask for it. . . ."],["p","In this price list we have taken a step in the right direction by offering you goods at the same price your dealer buys for, in some cases lower."]],["p","But the mail-order business proved tricky: customers were not always pleased with the items that arrived on their doorsteps. In 1952, Kamprad bought a joinery in Älmhult—his grandfather’s general store had once occupied the site—and set up a showroom, where people could come and see the goods. “At that moment, the basis of the modern ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," concept was created, and in principle it still applies: first and foremost, use a catalogue to tempt people to come to an exhibition, which today is our store,” Kamprad later said. In 1963, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," opened its first store outside Sweden, in Oslo. Ten years later, ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," was expanding so frantically that German executives accidentally opened a store in Konstanz when they had meant to open one in Koblenz."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIn%20June%2C%20I%20flew%20to%20Copenhagen.%20From%20there%2C%20I%20look%20a%20train%20to%20%C3%84lmhult.%20Out%20the%20window%2C%20I%20glimpsed%20a%20series%20of%20glittering%20lakes%20that%20appeared%20to%20be%20populated%20by%20the%20hardy%20mothers%20and%20cherubic%20children%20of%20La%20Leche%20League%20literature.%20Abandoned%20crofts%20bordered%20wooden%20cottages%20painted%20Sweden%E2%80%99s%20traditional%20Falu%20red.%20Two%20and%20a%20half%20hours%20later%2C%20I%20reached%20%C3%84lmhult%E2%80%99s%20station.%20The%20town%20was%20quiet%2C%20as%20though%20a%20storm%20had%20just%20blown%20through.%20I%20walked%20across%20the%20tracks%20and%2C%20in%20five%20minutes%2C%20arrived%20at%20what%20is%20known%20as%20the%20%E2%80%9C%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20village%E2%80%9D%3A%20a%20large%20parking%20lot%20surrounded%20by%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20corporate%20offices%2C%20an%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20store%2C%20a%20museum%2C%20and%20an%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20hotel.%20Twenty-five%20hundred%20of%20%C3%84lmhult%E2%80%99s%20eighty-five%20hundred%20inhabitants%20work%20for%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E.%20Spending%20time%20in%20%C3%84lmhult%20is%20a%20prerequisite%20for%20advancing%20one%E2%80%99s%20career%20at%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20and%20the%20social%20scene%20is%20as%20intense%20as%20the%20professional%20one.%20%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20a%20very%20strange%20climate%2C%E2%80%9D%20Johan%20Stenebo%2C%20the%20former%20employee%2C%20told%20me.%20%E2%80%9C%C3%84lmhult%20is%20pretty%20much%20what%20you%20get%20if%20you%20live%20in%20the%20middle%20of%20a%20dark%2C%20boring%20forest.%E2%80%9D%20It%20sounded%20like%20a%20mixture%20of%20Lowell%2C%20Massachusetts%2C%20summer%20camp%2C%20and%20%E2%80%9CIce%20Storm%E2%80%9D-era%20New%20Canaan.%20According%20to%20an%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20brochure%2C%20%E2%80%9CAt%20first%20sight%2C%20%C3%84lmhult%20seems%20very%20normal.%20But%20in%20time%20a%20sense%20of%20positive%20madness%20begins%20to%20surface.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMy%20first%20appointment%20in%20%C3%84lmhult%20was%20at%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Ccorporate%20culture%20centre%2C%E2%80%9D%20Tillsammans.%20(It%20means%20%E2%80%9Ctogether%E2%80%9D%20in%20Swedish.)%20Michele%20Acuna%2C%20who%20had%20recently%20moved%20to%20%C3%84lmhult%20from%20Shanghai%2C%20was%20my%20guide.%20A%20native%20Californian%20in%20her%20forties%2C%20she%20spoke%20fluent%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3En.%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%99s%20products%20offered%20%E2%80%9Csolutions%E2%80%9D%20to%20%E2%80%9Cchallenges.%E2%80%9D%20Its%20employees%20were%20%E2%80%9Cco-workers.%E2%80%9D%20Kamprad%20was%20%E2%80%9CIngvar%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20founder.%E2%80%9D%20Rooms%20were%20%E2%80%9Cliving%20situations%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%2C%20a%20circle%20graph%20explained%2C%20are%20occupied%20by%20eight%20categories%20of%20people%3A%20%E2%80%9Cbaby%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Ctoddler%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cstarting%20school%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Ctweens%20and%20teens%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cliving%20single%2Fstarting%20out%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cliving%20single%2Festablished%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cliving%20together%2Fstarting%20out%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cliving%20together%2Festablished.%E2%80%9D%20(The%20uncertainty%20I%20felt%20at%20deciding%20which%20label%20I%20qualified%20for%20reminded%20me%20why%20a%20trip%20to%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20can%20induce%20existential%20dread.)%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EInside%20the%20museum%2C%20I%20played%20a%20magnetic%20matching%20game%2C%20pairing%20products%20with%20their%20designers.%20Traditionally%2C%20the%20names%20of%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%E2%80%99s%20bookcases%20derive%20from%20different%20occupations%3B%20curtains%20are%20given%20names%20from%20mathematics%3B%20and%20bathroom%20products%20are%20named%20for%20lakes%20and%20rivers.%20A%20file%20cabinet%20was%20filled%20with%20cards%20bearing%20unfortunate%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20product%20names%3A%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EANIS%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EDICK%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EFANNY%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EBRACKEN%3C%2Fem%3E%20(a%20homophone%20for%20%E2%80%9Cvomiting%E2%80%9D%20in%20Dutch)%2C%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EGUTVIK%3C%2Fem%3E%20(a%20child%E2%80%99s%20bed%3B%20it%20sounds%20like%20%E2%80%9Cgood%20fuck%E2%80%9D%20in%20German).%20At%20a%20poker%20table%2C%20I%20perused%20cards%20inscribed%20with%20bits%20of%20Kampradiana%3A%20the%20time%20s

June, I flew to Copenhagen. From there, I look a train to Älmhult. Out the window, I glimpsed a series of glittering lakes that appeared to be populated by the hardy mothers and cherubic children of La Leche League literature. Abandoned crofts bordered wooden cottages painted Sweden’s traditional Falu red. Two and a half hours later, I reached Älmhult’s station. The town was quiet, as though a storm had just blown through. I walked across the tracks and, in five minutes, arrived at what is known as the “",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," village”: a large parking lot surrounded by ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," corporate offices, an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," store, a museum, and an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," hotel. Twenty-five hundred of Älmhult’s eighty-five hundred inhabitants work for ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],". Spending time in Älmhult is a prerequisite for advancing one’s career at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],", and the social scene is as intense as the professional one. “It’s a very strange climate,” Johan Stenebo, the former employee, told me. “Älmhult is pretty much what you get if you live in the middle of a dark, boring forest.” It sounded like a mixture of Lowell, Massachusetts, summer camp, and “Ice Storm”-era New Canaan. According to an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," brochure, “At first sight, Älmhult seems very normal. But in time a sense of positive madness begins to surface.”"],["p","My first appointment in Älmhult was at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s “corporate culture centre,” Tillsammans. (It means “together” in Swedish.) Michele Acuna, who had recently moved to Älmhult from Shanghai, was my guide. A native Californian in her forties, she spoke fluent ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"n. ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s products offered “solutions” to “challenges.” Its employees were “co-workers.” Kamprad was “Ingvar” or “the founder.” Rooms were “living situations,” which, a circle graph explained, are occupied by eight categories of people: “baby,” “toddler,” “starting school,” “tweens and teens,” “living single/starting out,” “living single/established,” “living together/starting out,” and “living together/established.” (The uncertainty I felt at deciding which label I qualified for reminded me why a trip to ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," can induce existential dread.)"],["p","Inside the museum, I played a magnetic matching game, pairing products with their designers. Traditionally, the names of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s bookcases derive from different occupations; curtains are given names from mathematics; and bathroom products are named for lakes and rivers. A file cabinet was filled with cards bearing unfortunate ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," product names: ",["em",{"class":"small"},"ANIS"],", ",["em",{"class":"small"},"DICK"],", ",["em",{"class":"small"},"FANNY"],", ",["em",{"class":"small"},"BRACKEN"]," (a homophone for “vomiting” in Dutch), ",["em",{"class":"small"},"GUTVIK"]," (a child’s bed; it sounds like “good fuck” in German). At a poker table, I perused cards inscribed with bits of Kampradiana: the time someone tried to sell the founder an intercom system, and the founder yelled to a co-worker, “We already have one!”; the time the founder was in Romania, looking at a freezer case full of ducks, and wondered, What do they do with all the feathers? (He wanted to use them for pillows.) The feather story is to Kamprad as the cherry-tree tale is to George Washington. In another version I heard, it was China and chickens."],["p","Near a display of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"LACK"]," tables, we ran into an executive—a European with reading glasses and a sweater draped over his shoulders. “It is one of the most copied,” he said, of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"LACK"],". “So many have tried to do the same. But they make it a little more ugly.” He, Acuna, and the P.R. person who had accompanied us dissolved into a round of giggles."],["p","On the way out the door, I noticed a video of Kamprad, in a chambray shirt and gold chain, playing on a nearby screen.

After the war, the ",["em","folkhemmet"]," became manifest in the Scandinavian design movement, which envisaged a world in which beautiful things would be made accessible to everyone through mass production.

It justified the company’s scary-genius approach to cost-cutting, declaring, “Sustained profitability gives us resources to grow further and offer a better everyday life for more of the many people.” Mikael Ohlsson, the C.E.O., promised a new era of transparency. He said that he had decided to publish the report in response to interest from co-workers. However, the ",["em","Financial Times"]," noted, “Mr. Ohlsson’s drive for openness is long overdue, and intended to restore a corporate reputation sullied by a highly critical book by former senior ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," executive Johan Stenebo.”"],["p","Ohlsson, a smiling blond man in rumpled khakis, told me that the purpose of the report was to diffuse some of the mystery surrounding ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],", the ownership of which Kamprad transferred to a private foundation in 1982. “If you don’t tell, people start to wonder,” he said."],["p","Ohlsson seemed almost wounded by the suggestion that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," was a multibillion-dollar business, rather than an altruistic concern. “",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," was and will remain value-driven,” he said. “You see, this is to create a better life for the many people.” ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," attempts to resolve the paradox of its devotion to cost-cutting and its altruistic self-image with team spirit.

If he starts with only your first name it is a sharp request. If the fax starts with ‘Dearest’ you are in his good books.” The atmosphere at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," reminded me of that of a political campaign, with true believers, whispering skeptics, inside jokes, and deflection of even the most innocuous questions.

The plant opened in 2008. As the Los Angeles ",["em","Times"]," reported, locals were, at first, mostly thrilled to hear that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," had chosen to build the plant—its only one in the United States—in Danville, a former textile town where the average annual income is twenty-nine thousand dollars."],["p","Although the company had a reputation as a conscientious employer—it has ranked in ",["em","Fortune’s"]," list of the “Top 100 Companies to Work For”—there was trouble in Danville from the start. Six former employees filed grievances with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging racial discrimination. Employees complained that they were required to work mandatory overtime, often with no notice. Mike Ward, the head of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," USA, acknowledged, when we spoke in July, that mandatory overtime had been a problem.

(",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s code of conduct stipulates that workers be allowed to join unions if they choose to do so.) Several days later, I spoke to Bill Street, who leads the woodworkers’ division of the I.A.M.A.W. He said that conditions in Danville were still unacceptable. “I truly believe that Danville management has a plantation mentality,” he said. “They think that they own these workers and it’s their right to use them any way they so choose.”"],["p","Tawanda Tarpley, a union member who has worked at Swedwood since 2008, was less combative, but her complaints were the same. Swedwood’s managers, Tarpley said, hired their white friends and family members, overlooking black workers, even when they were more qualified. “I think it’s more of a structural unfairness, because

television."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20catalogue%20is%20a%20primer%20for%20the%20sort%20of%20%E2%80%9Cgood%2C%20clean%20living%E2%80%9D%20of%20which%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20approves.%20The%20company%20published%20a%20hundred%20and%20ninety-seven%20million%20catalogues%20last%20year%2C%20in%20twenty-nine%20languages%20and%20sixty-one%20editions.%20As%20reading%20material%2C%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20catalogue%20is%20only%20slightly%20less%20popular%20than%20Harry%20Potter%20books.%20It%20combines%20the%20voyeuristic%20pleasures%20of%20browsing%20albums%20on%20Facebook%20(peeping%20into%20other%20people%E2%80%99s%20houses)%20with%20the%20aspirational%20ones%20of%20%3Cem%3EArchitectural%20Digest%3C%2Fem%3E%20(we%20are%20all%20a%20%2439.99%20bookshelf%20away%20from%20being%20well-read%20Swedish%20architects).%20The%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20catalogue%20is%20a%20self-help%20manual%20for%20a%20certain%20kind%20of%20life.%20The%20French%20singer%20Renaud%20observes%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CLes%20Bobos%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9CTheir%20bedtime%20reading%20is%20.%20.%20.%20next%20to%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20catalogue%20%2F%20They%20like%20Japanese%20restaurants%20and%20Korean%20cinema.%E2%80%9D%20They%20used%20to%20like%20ferns%2C%20but%20now%20they%20like%20orchids.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20%C3%84lmhult%2C%20I%20visited%20the%20offices%20of%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20Communications%2C%20where%20the%20catalogue%20is%20made.%20Selin%20Hult%2C%20an%20information%20manager%2C%20and%20Henrik%20Palmberg%2C%20who%20said%20he%20was%20a%20%E2%80%9Ccompetence%20matrix%20owner%2C%E2%80%9D%20showed%20me%20around.%20We%20enjoyed%20%3Cem%3Efika%3C%2Fem%3E%2C%20the%20Swedish%20coffee%20break%2C%20with%20summer%20cake%20and%20mugs%20of%20tea%2C%20and%20then%20set%20off%20on%20a%20tour.%20First%2C%20we%20walked%20through%20a%20vast%20warehouse%20lined%20with%20towering%20racks%20of%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20products%E2%80%94a%20sort%20of%20furniture%20lending%20library%2C%20where%20an%20interior%20designer%20can%20check%20out%20whatever%20crib%20or%20dresser%20he%20needs.%20It%20looked%20as%20though%20an%20entire%20high-rise%20had%20disgorged%20its%20contents.%20All%20around%20us%2C%20I%20could%20see%20three-sided%20rooms%2C%20like%20sitcom%20sets.%20%E2%80%9CAt%20full%20capacity%2C%20we%20can%20do%20twenty-five%20at%20once%2C%E2%80%9D%20Palmberg%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20a%20far%20corner%2C%20a%20room%20set%20had%20been%20built%20and%20furnished%20to%20resemble%20a%20bed-and-breakfast%20in%20the%20Swedish%20countryside.%20Whenever%20an%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20designer%20creates%20a%20room%20set%2C%20for%20the%20catalogue%20or%20in%20a%20store%2C%20he%20or%20she%20writes%20up%20a%20detailed%20treatment.%20The%20treatment%20for%20the%20bed-and-breakfast%20read%2C%20%E2%80%9CStory%3A%20a%20weekend%20hobby%20that%20turned%20into%20a%20full-time%20business%2C%20this%20B.%20and%20B.%20is%20nestled%20in%20the%20countryside%20untroubled%20by%20tourists.%20It%20is%20popular%20among%20those%20taking%20a%20break%20from%20the%20city%20and%20looking%20for%20peace%20and%20quiet.%20Despite%20its%20rural%20setting%2C%20this%20B.%20and%20B.%20is%20tastefully%20decorated%20to%20appeal%20to%20its%20urban%20guests.%E2%80%9D%20The%20room%E2%80%99s%20designer%2C%20Sara%20Bohlin%2C%20had%20appointed%20the%20time%20of%20day%20%E2%80%9CMorning%2FBreakfast.%E2%80%9D%20The%20price%2C%20%E2%80%9CMedium.%E2%80%9D%20She%20had%20even%20mocked%20up%20a%20brochure%20for%20the%20place%2C%20which%20she%20had%20named%20Alanda.%20She%20was%20still%20putting%20on%20final%20touches.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20in%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20panic%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20kitchen%20looked%20rustically%20inviting%2C%20with%20wide%20white%20floorboards%20and%20white%20walls.%20The%20focal%20point%20was%20a%20large%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ESTORN%C3%84S%3C%2Fem%3E%20dining%20table%2C%20in%20gray%2C%20with%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3ESTEFAN%3C%2Fem%3E%20chairs%20and%20a%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EM%C3%85NLJUS%3C%2Fem%3E%20pendant%20lamp.%20There%20were%20board%20games%20and%20a%20stack%20of%20woollen%20blankets%20on%20shelves%2C%20for%20the%20guests.%20A%20spotlight%20simulated%20a%20beam%20of%20morning%20light%20hitting%20the%20table.%20(You%20will%20find%20three%20types%20of%20lighting%20schemes%20in%20the%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3EIKEA%3C%2Fem%3E%20catalogue%3A%20Let%20the%20Sun%20In%2C%20Lamps%20Lit%2C%20and%20Middle%20of%20the%20Day.)%20A%20carpenter%20had%20installed%20a%20real%20wood-burning%20stove%2C%20which%20the%20designer%20had%20found%2C%20into%20a%2

",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue is a primer for the sort of “good, clean living” of which ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," approves. The company published a hundred and ninety-seven million catalogues last year, in twenty-nine languages and sixty-one editions. As reading material, the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue is only slightly less popular than Harry Potter books. It combines the voyeuristic pleasures of browsing albums on Facebook (peeping into other people’s houses) with the aspirational ones of ",["em","Architectural Digest"]," (we are all a $39.99 bookshelf away from being well-read Swedish architects). The ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue is a self-help manual for a certain kind of life. The French singer Renaud observes, in “Les Bobos,” “Their bedtime reading is . . . next to the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue / They like Japanese restaurants and Korean cinema.” They used to like ferns, but now they like orchids."],["p","In Älmhult, I visited the offices of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," Communications, where the catalogue is made. Selin Hult, an information manager, and Henrik Palmberg, who said he was a “competence matrix owner,” showed me around. We enjoyed ",["em","fika"],", the Swedish coffee break, with summer cake and mugs of tea, and then set off on a tour. First, we walked through a vast warehouse lined with towering racks of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," products—a sort of furniture lending library, where an interior designer can check out whatever crib or dresser he needs. It looked as though an entire high-rise had disgorged its contents. All around us, I could see three-sided rooms, like sitcom sets. “At full capacity, we can do twenty-five at once,” Palmberg said."],["p","In a far corner, a room set had been built and furnished to resemble a bed-and-breakfast in the Swedish countryside. Whenever an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," designer creates a room set, for the catalogue or in a store, he or she writes up a detailed treatment. The treatment for the bed-and-breakfast read, “Story: a weekend hobby that turned into a full-time business, this B. and B. is nestled in the countryside untroubled by tourists. It is popular among those taking a break from the city and looking for peace and quiet. Despite its rural setting, this B. and B. is tastefully decorated to appeal to its urban guests.” The room’s designer, Sara Bohlin, had appointed the time of day “Morning/Breakfast.” The price, “Medium.” She had even mocked up a brochure for the place, which she had named Alanda. She was still putting on final touches. “I’m in a bit of a panic,” she said."],["p","The kitchen looked rustically inviting, with wide white floorboards and white walls. The focal point was a large ",["em",{"class":"small"},"STORNÄS"]," dining table, in gray, with ",["em",{"class":"small"},"STEFAN"]," chairs and a ",["em",{"class":"small"},"MÅNLJUS"]," pendant lamp. There were board games and a stack of woollen blankets on shelves, for the guests. A spotlight simulated a beam of morning light hitting the table. (You will find three types of lighting schemes in the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue: Let the Sun In, Lamps Lit, and Middle of the Day.) A carpenter had installed a real wood-burning stove, which the designer had found, into a “brick” hearth made of plywood. On the table sat a ceramic milk pitcher. To complete the tableau, Bohlin had gone out to fetch fresh bread and marmalade."],["p","Just as the goal of a real room is to look like a fake one, the goal of a fake room is to look like a real one. At the catalogue headquarters, Hult and Palmberg showed me into a large room filled with kitchen supplies. I marvelled at bins of plastic food: mushrooms, strawberries, apples, lemons, bell peppers, bunches of green grapes. “When we go close, we go fresh,” Palmberg said. “Otherwise, we go fake.” A loaf of sourdough in the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," catalogue will have a slice taken out. If the photograph shows something frying, there ought to be grease in the pan, but not all over the stove. Some splashes in the sink are nice."],["p","“Pillows should be a bit squished,” Bohlin said. “If you have a teacup, maybe there should be some smoke showing.”"],["p","Palmberg added, “And water on the floor outside the bathroom!”"],["p",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," attempts to make the room sets generically pleasing, but in some cases cultural differences necessitate tweaks. “We say we need to be as global as possible and as local as necessary,” Palmberg said. You’ll see a friendly golden retriever curled up by the dining-room table in the British catalogue, but not in the Emirati one.

He lives in the Swiss village of Epalinges, near Lausanne. “Kamprad has only very little taxes to pay,” Yvan Tardy, the mayor of Epalinges, told the Dutch newspaper ",["em","Algemeen Dagblad"],". “Unfortunately, he has never done anything for our village.” Kamprad’s nickname in town is the Miser."],["p","A bigger blow to Kamprad’s reputation came in 1994, when the Swedish newspaper ",["em","Expressen"]," published evidence revealing that Kamprad had once been active in the Swedish Nazi movement. The stories, by Pelle Tagesson, showed that Kamprad, between the ages of sixteen and twenty-five, had been a disciple of Per Engdahl, the leader of the Neo-Swedish movement. In 1948, Kamprad paid to publish a book of Engdahl’s political writings. In 1950, he invited Engdahl to his wedding, writing that he was proud to be a part of the Neo-Swedish circle. After ",["em","Expressen’s"]," revelations, Kamprad faxed a handwritten letter to his employees, entitled “",["em",{"class":"small"},"MY GREATEST FIASCO"],".” “Dear ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," family,” it read. “You have been young yourself, and perhaps you find something in your youth now, so long afterward, that was ridiculous and stupid. In that case, you will understand me better. In hindsight, I know that early on I should have included this in my fiascos, but that is now spilled milk.” The employees responded with a letter, signed by hundreds. “Ingvar, we are here whenever you need us.” Bertil Torekull, Kamprad’s handpicked biographer, writes, “Then the father of the family broke down and wept like a child.”"],["p","After more revelations of Nazi associations, Kamprad wrote an apology, which appeared in Torekull’s book, in a section entitled “A Youth and His Errors.” He explained that, growing up at Elmtaryd, he had been especially close to his grandmother, Grossmutter Franziska, who was from the Sudetenland. (Torekull writes that Kamprad didn’t come clean about all of his Nazi affiliations, because he had forgotten about them.) Kamprad concludes the chapter by asking, “As I have lain awake at night pondering this dismal affair, I have asked myself: when is an old man forgiven for the sins of his youth? Is it a crime that I was brought up by a German grandmother and a German father?”"],["p","Still, Kamprad enjoys a hero’s status in Sweden. “Everything that is about Ingvar Kamprad is big news,” Fredrik Sjöshult, a reporter for ",["em","Expressen"],", told me. “He’s lived, like our version of the American dream, the Swedish dream.” Last year, the Malmö City Theatre premièred “Ingvar! A Musical Furniture Saga.” In the production, the Kamprad character is crucified on a Maypole. He sings, “Do you think this can stop Ingvar?”"],["p","In 2009, Sweden’s largest television station, SVT, revealed that ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],"’s money—the three per cent collected from each store—does not actually go to a charitable foundation in Holland, as ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," had led people to believe. Rather, as Magnus Svenungsson reported, Inter ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," is owned by a foundation in Liechtenstein, called Interogo, a corporate rainy-day fund. Interogo, which has amassed twelve billion dollars, is controlled by the Kamprad family."],["p",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," is in the midst of a succession crisis. With his second wife, Margaretha, Kamprad has three sons, Peter, Jonas, and Matthias. None has any public profile. None has distinguished himself particularly within the company. In earlier years, Kamprad spoke of a sort of battle royal in which the son who proved himself most capable would inherit control of the company. More recently, he and his associates have suggested that none of them possess sufficient mettle."],["p",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," would tell me only, “Peter, Jonas, and Matthias Kamprad will continue to occupy important board positions and actively participate in the future governance of the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," sphere companies. How they will exactly divide up the roles among them is under discussion.”"],["p","Even Bertil Torekull, who has likened Kamprad, as a leader, to “some venerable African freedom fighter,” admitted that Kamprad’s reluctance to anoint a successor endangered the stability of ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],". “What he’s doing is risky,” Torekull told me. “It’s definitely time that other people must be more decisive or play a larger role.” He concluded, “Anything can happen when the strong Ingvar Kamprad is gone.”"],["p","Kamprad’s legacy in the dining room has never been in question. The Sunday that I bummed around on my living-room couch, I went over to a friend’s house for lunch. She served lamb on an ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," platter and poured wine into ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," wineglasses like the ones that I had earlier neglected to wash. At the end of September, she’s moving in with her boyfriend. She wrote to me, “I’m really torn about the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"]," question. Inevitably, there will be a trip there, but I’m actually really keen to take a bit more time this time around, and not do the ‘quick fix house kit-out’ and try and get some more bits and pieces from antique auctions and so on. But, then, who has the time and the patience (and the money!) to do that?” ♦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/house-perfect","categories":{"formatting":{"ledeImageLayout":{"id":"5904907fc9e5b50e348ceb2c","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Lede Image Layout","parent":[{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"formatting"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902aba007071543e751a993","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Formatting","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"formatting"},"slug":"lede-image-layout","subcategories":{"ledeImage":"rightAligned"}}},"sections-toc":[{"id":"590412649f91e567e06eca93","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Reporting","parent":[{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections - TOC","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections - TOC","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections-toc"},"slug":"sections-toc"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections - TOC","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902abaf27562e4d156e37e1","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections - TOC","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections-toc"},"slug":"sections-toc"},"slug":"reporting"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907ef12019dfc3494e9c8f2","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5902ab3b07071543e751a992","modelName":"category","contributors":{},"name":"Sections","parent":[],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sections"},"slug":"sections"},"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Amy Poehler","url":"/tag/amy-poehler"},{"name":"China","url":"/tag/china"},{"name":"David Fincher","url":"/tag/david-fincher"},{"name":"Financial Times","url":"/tag/financial-times"},{"name":"Fortune","url":"/tag/fortune"},{"name":"Home Furnishings","url":"/tag/home-furnishings"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Lauren Collins","type":"author","title":"Lauren Collins began working at <em>The New Yorker</em> in 2003 and became a staff writer in 2008.
