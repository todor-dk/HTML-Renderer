<p>Step 1 &#8211; If you’re in India or any other country where the game haven&#8217;t been released yet, then go ahead and download Pokemon Go APK first. You can use the previous heading in this guide to get it.</p>

<p>Step 4 &#8211; Right click on the APK file you just downloaded and then you’ll have an option to click on. Yes, open it with the BlueStacks app player.</p>
<p>Step 5 &#8211; Now, go ahead and install the app using the Pokemon GO APK method. It will not take any longer than a minute.</p>
<p>If you live in a country where Pokemon Go is already available, then instead of installing it via its APK, you can go ahead and use the search tool of BlueStacks app player to get the game from Google Play store. In any case, you’ll be asked to login with a Google account. It is mandatory as we’re going to use the Google Play services.</p>
<h3 id="Game_Play">Pokemon GO Download: Game Play</h3>
<p>The game is simple to understand but not that easy to master as it requires you to go out in the outdoors and find and collect new one.

<p>There are different species of Pokemon residing in different areas of the world. These depend on the weather and the environmental surroundings of the area you’re currently in and it will be really challenging to get those different kinds of Pokemon.</p>
<p>But, once you have a lot of different breeds, it will help your profile to raise upwards.</p>

<p>The concept is to implement the Pokemon in the real life. This adds and puts Pokemon at different places in real life and a user with a smartphone can catch them all. But, before catching them, one has to find them in real life. This requires a lot of walking in the outdoor locations and this is the concept of this game, the primary one.</p>
