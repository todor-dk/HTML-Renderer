If that's the case, there's no need to worry. We've got you covered.\nSEE ALSO: The 'Third Thumb' prosthetic for anyone makes me really want an extra finger\nEach week we round up the most important app news along with some of the coolest new and updated apps to help you stay on top of it all. Here's what caught our eye this week. And if you're looking for more, be sure to take a look at last week's roundup.\nEnlight Photofox\nIntroducing #EnlightPhotofox. Here to amaze you with the #art you'll create on #iPhone. Get now for free: https://t.co/stO6UsD3gg pic.twitter.com/Y7mYRaWzcp— Enlight Photofox (@EnlightPhotofox) July 6, 2017\n\nEveryone wants their photos to be the coolest on the feed. But it's not always easy to get the look you want with the relatively small array of free options provided on each form of social media. Enlight Photofox is a premium photo editing app, and it's free! The brand has taken on the idea of making the app free and including features anyone can purchase within it.\nIf you really want to be serious about your photo editing, you might just want to buck up and shell out. Any subscriber who spends at least $3.99 a month, $19.99 a year, or $39.99 up front will have access to all of Enlight's features. The optional subscription lets you add photoshop-style layers and graphic elements to your photos. \nYou can also dive into the \"Darkroom\", a subscription-only mode with more filters and the ability to change tonal parameters. So give Enlight Photofox a shot if you're trying to become the top dog on the photo feed. \nGoogle Earth\nNew (and fuzzy) on @googleearth: live Alaskan Brown Bear cams from @exploreorg! We can bearly wait to spot one! https://t.co/iVGrcVkozF pic.twitter.com/09HxsvCrnh— Google (@Google) July 5, 2017\n\nGoogle Earth just graced the world with something we didn't know we needed. But now that it's here, we can never go back. This beautiful addition to Google Earth is the live stream of dozens of environments. \nThe app gives you a realtime, up-close look at some of your favorite habitats. You can watch lazy walruses in Alaska or swimming sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. And you can't forget the brown bears of Katmai National Park fishing during the salmon rush.\nWhichever habitat you like best, check it out on Google Earth. Even if you're not a huge animal buff, the natural ebb and flow of these environments running continuously on your screen is quite soothing. \nPokémon Go Anniversary\n\nPokémon Go: The game the world will never forget for making police departments and MTA workers post signs reminding people the world around them still exists IRL. It turned one year old this week. \nTo celebrate, players can wear Ash Ketchum's hat to catch special Pikachus from now until July 24. There are also discount anniversary boxes with raid passes, ultra balls, max revives, and incubators. But that's not all. \nA number of cities will be hosting anniversary events. One in particular is Pokémon Go Fest at Chicago's Grant Park on July 22. There will be new Pokémon that have never appeared in the park before, a new medal to add to your profile page, and -- of course -- three team lounges so you can relax with your fellow Insinct, Mystic, or Valor mates.\nBe sure to check if your city is hosting an event, get out there, and keep collecting!\nElsewhere\n\nEver wanted to feel the thrill of flying a plane, but your lack of a pilot license means you'll never be able to? Airplane Flight Pilot Simulation is a free iOS app that's ready to take you into the sky. \nYou'll have your choice of aircraft designs to zip through the 3D skies, for everything from leisure flights to rescue missions. The realistic flight physics, on-screen controls, and sound effects will really get you into the game. So hop in the cockpit and take off!\n\nPanoramic pictures are fun and easy to create on your smartphone, and they provide a way to capture a huge portion of the space around you. But when you try to post your creations on Instagram, they either appear so small that you can't really see what's in the photo, or part of your cool view ends up getting cut off. \nUnsquared, a free app, is here to take the stress out of posting panoramas. You just choose how many pieces you want your photo to be split into, do some cropping, and post away! It's super easy and it'll make you look like a professional on Instagram.\n\nKeep the world safe from an undead menace by bringing an AC-130 gunship's powerful arsenal to bear on the walking corpses. Building on the successes of the original game, Zombie Gunship Survival, a free app, introduces more hooks -- such as base-building -- to keep you invested in fending off the imminent apocalypse.\n\nFrequent travelers, this one's for you. The free HelloGbye app helps you stay organized before, during, and after your trips. You can schedule travel plans, make changes to your itinerary, keep all your confirmation details in one place, manage budgets for solo and group trips, and take advantage of the app's built-in search features to weed out less popular picks. \nPaying subscribers enjoy additional benefits, including preferred hotel rates, no booking fees, and cash back on hotel stays.\n\nLast but not least is Sticky AI! It's all about selfie stickers purely to add a little bit of fun to your messaging apps. You can use the app to make animated or still stickers. Then save the brightly colored comic or cartoon-style designs to your sticker pack to use in the future. Download Sticky AI and start having a little more fun with your social networks.\nThat's all we've got for this week. But be sure to check back next week for all of your app-related updates.\nWATCH: Someone has reinvented the surfboard, and it can 'fly' on water"},"shares":{"google_plus":19,"linked_in":31,"facebook":145,"twitter":397,"total":592},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uuJlI1wAPji4iD8lKIlqRlK72cs=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F528450%2F12f82d18-4cdf-4566-bca2-d337f889f7ad.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/mVsQ3sLNrYc0A71wF5_UT1FejB4=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KnBiI0U_qxUImBS1rDlZqPjTZ1Q=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_K1HSHXgswxtpxjW12BwMS8yDgI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/yXdtlh-n9M3xaky-CV_kcnFaZiI=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3X_VOi5vtFWAOBITnTY7h6XRXak=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50692%2F0259b965-2ba4-4c36-9fe2-47549456d02b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2tDTL9m","display_title":"This week in apps: 'Pokémon Go' turns one, Google Earth live streams, and photo tricks","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"gjnL5DMl2q","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Unlimited fun.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"This week in apps: 'Pokémon Go' turns one, Google Earth live streams, and photo tricks"},{"_id":"595f7eb5f11b2c2a2a0007c4","id":"2017/07/07/pokemon-go-new-2017-features-you-missed-out-on","title":"'Pokémon Go' has totally transformed one year on and you should tap back in","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-07-07T12:29:40+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 12:29:40 +0000","formatted_date":"07/07/2017","formatted_shares":"587","sort_key":"1DttgV","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/07/pokemon-go-new-2017-features-you-missed-out-on/","content":{"plain":"It makes me kind of sad to think that Pokémon Go is now a year old.\nActually sad is probably the wrong word -- more nostalgic, maybe. When I think back to July and August last year it seemed like absolutely everyone in the world was playing it: friends, colleagues, family, random people in the street.\nYou'd go out on your lunch break and you'd see people doing it: gleeful kids, surreptitious businessmen, strangers chatting to each other outside virtual gyms. The game created a frantic energy that makes this summer's fidget spinner craze look positively tiny in comparison.\nSEE ALSO: 7 things 'Pokémon Go' badly needs in 2017\nAnyway, it's now a year on and I'm still doggedly playing. So's my uncle. I introduced it to him last July, and he became even more obsessed with the game than me. He's now level 37, and I'm level 35.\nObviously the game is nowhere near the same as it used to be in the weeks that followed its release. But anyone who tells you it's \"dead\" clearly hasn't seen thriving Reddit communities like The Silph Road (which has almost a quarter of a million subscribers), or felt the renewed buzz of excitement when Niantic released a huge gym update a couple of weeks back.\nAnyway, I'm not going to waffle on too much about why the game's still relevant. If the anniversary nostalgia has given you any urge at all to re-open the app, though, here are some of the cool new things you'll be greeted by.\nGeneration 2 Pokémon\n\nGeneration 2 was finally launched back in February, and saw over 80 new Pokémon get added to the game.\nThe big pink one above and on the left is Blissey, who'll you'll see a lot of in gyms nowadays (she may look friendly, but she's one of the toughest 'mon in the game now).\nSweet new items\n\nThe most recent big update came a couple of weeks ago, and it introduced a bunch of awesome new stuff. One surprise addition was a handful of new items -- Golden Razz Berrys make Pokémon way easier to catch, Rare Candy can be fed to a specific Pokémon and turned into a candy of that type, and TMs -- a cool addition that anyone who played the Game Boy games will remember -- let you teach a Pokémon a new move.\nGym badges\n\nAnother thing anyone who played the Game Boy games will remember is gym badges. Since the gym revamp that came with the big June update, these can now be collected like medals. You can upgrade them to bronze, silver, and gold by attacking and defending gyms, and they can be spun like Pokéstops to give you items.\nHuge, collaborative battles\n\nThis is easily the coolest new thing Niantic has introduced to the game since its launch. Raids basically involve you and a team of up to 20 players taking on a super badass Pokémon that hatches out of a giant egg above a gym: if you beat the Pokémon, you get rewarded with the new items and you get a one-off chance to catch a smaller version of the monster. It's a great incentive to chat to random people or play the game in a group, and all in all it's a huge step towards what Niantic initially promised in the game's trailer (remember that group of people in Times Square battling Mewtwo)? \nWhich finally brings us on to...\nThe hint of legendaries around the corner\n\nThe introduction of Raids has finally introduced a game mechanic that make legendary Pokémon a real, near-future possibility. There are currently four Raid levels of difficulty, but there have been hints of a fifth \"legendary\" level in the pipeline, which will finally allow players to get hold of Pokémon like good 'ol Mewtwo. We don't know exactly when or how these legendaries will be introduced, but the beginning of real-world events like the upcoming Pokémon GO Fest Chicago could be just the place to kick things off...\nOK: so ultimately the game is nothing like what it was last summer. It'll never be quite like that again. \nBut if you do have an itching to dust off that Pokédex, now is a better time than ever before.\nWATCH: How crazy your office gets when 'Pokémon Go' crashes"},"shares":{"facebook":125,"twitter":447,"google_plus":10,"linked_in":5,"total":587},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/p7OXwJX_0sCfE0GLFpwHRk4btik=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F529023%2F6613e1a9-adfd-4f91-8e83-c7013f13b91d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/UTNmALW8OU7Y0Ly-EtU3hCGwMAI=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50760%2F1ef35a71-dc7e-4153-9412-3cd51ad8912b.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/4RnCJ_LcIc9-ir1-Sp-WypRQmCQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50760%2F1ef35a71-dc7e-4153-9412-3cd51ad8912b.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Dp2MIvwPNnZUciN3fK8Uy_dmJ-w=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50760%2F1ef35a71-dc7e-4153-9412-3cd51ad8912b.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/X_nhD3mtCuj4M06dnqkyzKwqd5E=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50760%2F1ef35a71-dc7e-4153-9412-3cd51ad8912b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SwcwA-pAvR8G2g4-LW-44srSYjw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F50760%2F1ef35a71-dc7e-4153-9412-3cd51ad8912b.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2txofd9","display_title":"'Pokémon Go' has totally transformed one year on and you should tap back in","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"3O4oKYpndV","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Not dead yet.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Pokémon Go' has totally transformed one year on and you should tap back in"},{"_id":"595e5d6df11b2c0dab000f6d","id":"2017/07/06/pokemon-go-birthday","title":"'Pokémon Go' celebrates its first birthday by giving Pikachu a hat","title_tag":null,"author":"Kellen Beck","post_date":"2017-07-06T15:55:23+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:55:23 +0000","formatted_date":"07/06/2017","formatted_shares":"344","sort_key":"1Dt97J","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/07/06/pokemon-go-birthday/","content":{"plain":"Pokémon Go is celebrating its first birthday this month with discounts on items and something for fans of the original Pokémon TV show: Pikachu, donning Ash's hat.\nSEE ALSO: 'Pokémon Go' is branding Pokémon caught by cheaters\nStarting today and running through July 24, Pikachus found in the wild will be wearing Ash's hat from the first season of the Pokémon anime.

We are humbled by the excitement for all the new features we announced yesterday.

With it comes a revamped Gym system and...raids! \nSEE ALSO: A major new 'Pokémon Go' update is on the way\nUnder the shade of some trees just outside the Los Angeles Convention Center last week, I got a tour of the new features coming in the Pokémon Go updates that will be slowly rolling out as of today.  \nGyms, Your Defending Pokémon, and Gym Badges \nIn an attempt to balance Gyms, Niantic will be introducing a few changes, summarized in these two paragraphs from a press release: \nThe new Gyms will add a spinnable Photo Disc (just like PokéStops) that will distribute unique items. Trainers will also receive Gym Badges—mementos of adventures that they can level up, increased rewards, and bonus items at Gyms. \n\nGyms will now feature six permanent slots that can be filled by the controlling team’s Pokémon, and opposing teams will battle Pokémon in the order they were assigned to the Gym. The new motivation system introduces an interactive factor for Pokémon assigned to a Gym that will impact their potential Combat Power (CP). Pokémon defending a Gym will lose motivation over time and as they are defeated, lowering their CP and making it easier for opposing teams to defeat them. Trainers from the same team can give defending Pokémon some Berries to keep them motivated.\n\nYou’ll be able to see all six defending Pokémon in one shot, as opposed to the current Gym system which has players swiping through them one at a time. Of the six, each has to be of a different species to ensure variety in each Gym.  \nNiantic has also decided to do away with the Prestige system -- the current system that lets players train their Pokémon which raises their prestige and, therefore, their Gym level, and secures that Gym more Pokémon slots -- because it was apparently too complicated. \nIn place of that prestige system is the new “motivation” system teased in the press release. A Pokémon’s motivation meter will diminish the longer you leave them in a Gym, or if they’ve been defeated. Giving that Pokémon berries will increase their motivation. The stronger the Pokémon, the faster its motivation and CP will drop. In combination with this change, you’ll now battle Pokémon in order of which have been at that Gym the longest, which Niantic hopes will give casual players a better chance to win battles, since those Pokémon will likely have a lower motivation score and therefore be easier to defeat first. \nRaids and Catching Legendaries \nNiantic representatives handed a group of reporters loaner Pixel phones loaded with Pokémon Go updates for the 30-minute outdoor demo session. They had us look at the map on our loaner and Raid Bosses appeared on the map. These Raids are Niantic’s new, cooperative social mechanic that allows up to 20 trainers to take on Gyms together. They see this as their higher level content. \nHere’s the official, Niantic press release word on raids: \nRaid Battles are timed in-game events that will temporarily take over a Gym, providing Trainers from all teams the chance to visit the Gym and group up together to defeat the Raid Boss and earn special new items along with an opportunity to catch these Pokémon. Friends can also create Private Raid groups via a customizable code system that allows Trainers to invite their friends to a specific Raid group.\nWhen a Gym goes into this raid mode, it’ll spawn an egg and one to four raid boss icons. The countdown represents how long that raid boss will stick around for you to take them on. You don’t have to own the Gym to compete, but you will get an extra chance to capture the raid boss at the end of the battle if you do own that Gym. \n\nEvery player gets a raid pass once a day to participate in raids, but you will -- no surprise -- be able to purchase premium passes, as well, if you feel inclined to take on more than one raid a day. And then there are invitation-only raids -- sent out randomly -- which will involve rare and powerful Pokémon, including legendaries.  \nDefeating raid bosses also gets you a few new items. As stated in a blog post: \nAfter defeating a Raid Boss, you’ll receive fantastic rewards, including some new items obtained only by defeating a Raid Boss: Rare Candies, Golden Razz Berries, and two types of Technical Machines—Fast and Charged. A Rare Candy is a mysterious candy that, when used on a Pokémon, turns into that Pokémon’s Candy. Golden Razz Berries will greatly increase your chances of catching a Pokémon you encounter in the wild and can also be given to a Pokémon assigned to a Gym to fully recover its motivation meter. Technical Machines are items you can use to permanently teach a Pokémon a new Fast Attack or Charged Attack at random.\nThe update is still in beta as of now, and it sounds like everything will be rolling out slowly. Raid features will be coming last, after the Gym updates -- Niantic is still polishing up and figuring out exactly how many raids there will be and which Pokémon to put in them. Until the Gym features roll out worldwide, they’ll be temporarily disabling Gyms in its current form. And even once raids are rolled out in beta, only high level players will have access to them. Happy eventual raiding, everyone!\nWATCH:"},"shares":{"google_plus":8,"twitter":307,"facebook":41,"linked_in":7,"pinterest":1,"total":364},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wequ-vIXx8v0BLcOQPXqHGpx3NE=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F512285%2F64bc35df-db93-4ff9-93a4-387ca8917b28.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uLUnf45Xu-WDVPyjNaBqTbqMYBA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49047%2F3ed513d3-47ea-4172-9214-41216b1d9941.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/v14bIN_TrzY5LLMC6yumgdYin6s=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49047%2F3ed513d3-47ea-4172-9214-41216b1d9941.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6GEOSZPWIRVeC_KbACMAzqfyhks=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49047%2F3ed513d3-47ea-4172-9214-41216b1d9941.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/edzUWYo2Zpp2ILXqzWPb8eU4_tk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49047%2F3ed513d3-47ea-4172-9214-41216b1d9941.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ajLp0ssQ0DYDlvDEmzLfXRRvaOQ=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F49047%2F3ed513d3-47ea-4172-9214-41216b1d9941.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sOD7Gk","display_title":"'Pokémon Go' is getting raids","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"yMVlQJroNR","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Here's to all the legendary captures.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Pokémon Go' is getting raids"},{"_id":"59395c2928cc364dbe000224","id":"2017/06/08/pokemon-go-major-gym-update-news","title":"A major new 'Pokémon Go' update is on the way","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-06-08T14:16:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:16:07 +0000","formatted_date":"06/08/2017","formatted_shares":"279","sort_key":"1DiYej","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/06/08/pokemon-go-major-gym-update-news/","content":{"plain":"Brace yourselves, trainers -- the biggest Pokémon Go update since the release of Gen II is well on its way.\nSEE ALSO: A beginner's guide: How to play 'Pokémon Go'\nWe've known for a while that Niantic were planning a big overhaul to the current gym system (it was due a change, to be fair), and with today's announcement we now have a clearer idea of timings.\nThe good news?

Basically, from 13 June (1pm PDT) to 20 June (1pm PDT) we'll be seeing an increase in ice and fire Pokémon in the game.\nThere will also be \"huge\" XP bonuses for special types of throws (great, curveball, etc.), and a handy discount on lucky eggs.\nA big new gym update\nNiantic has previously said that \"three major releases\" will be coming to Pokémon Go in 2017. The update that will follow the Solstice event is the first of these.\nAccording to the announcement it will focus on \"collaborative group gameplay features that will get you playing Pokémon Go in fun new ways\". A new gym system, in other words.\nIn the build-up to this update, gyms will temporarily be disabled in the game (Niantic has confirmed they'll give us warning before this happens, though).\nReal-world events\nThe first real-world Pokémon Go event will be held in Chicago, Illinois on 22 July 2017 at Grant Park. There are no details on what exactly this will involve yet, but you can sign up on the Pokémon Go Live website for updates.\nThere will also be shopping centre-based events across Europe throughout the summer, and a \"Pikachu Outbreak\" event in Japan in August.\nWATCH: How crazy your office gets when 'Pokémon Go' crashes"},"shares":{"facebook":68,"google_plus":6,"twitter":202,"linked_in":2,"pinterest":1,"total":279},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XYciyORtAEH9gJnNylc2xCUDzuo=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F501754%2Fd4510f48-300e-4b0b-8e9d-a03acb1431e6.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/LZJesUAhxtrDIgYfvfGv1pfxmcc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48116%2Fe46b2c58-077e-48dd-a135-3529e9521c69.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Z35lsivJp35qj4PsLBEqpVhjp88=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48116%2Fe46b2c58-077e-48dd-a135-3529e9521c69.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bDo6QgyQIJDsRDY-oZ9WTAHaXkU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48116%2Fe46b2c58-077e-48dd-a135-3529e9521c69.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/kxFFMXmBfUpUze2liG_xqmFbaBQ=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48116%2Fe46b2c58-077e-48dd-a135-3529e9521c69.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ngSQ0PRkL85Ao2xET8RxADWqn00=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F48116%2Fe46b2c58-077e-48dd-a135-3529e9521c69.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2sXroBI","display_title":"A major new 'Pokémon Go' update is on the way","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"3O4oKYpndV","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Gyms will never be the same again.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"A major new 'Pokémon Go' update is on the way"},{"_id":"5924c08cf11b2c7dca000173","id":"2017/05/23/pokemon-go-anti-cheat","title":"Clever anti-cheat feature subtly makes 'Pokémon Go' worse for offenders","title_tag":null,"author":"Kellen Beck","post_date":"2017-05-23T23:06:51+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 23 May 2017 23:06:51 +0000","formatted_date":"05/23/2017","formatted_shares":"386","sort_key":"1DdiT9","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/23/pokemon-go-anti-cheat/","content":{"plain":"UPDATE: May 25, 2017, 9:09 a.m. EDT Niantic confirmed that people who violate the Pokémon Go terms of service (including using third-party software or cheats) may have their gameplay affected and may not be able to see all the Pokémon around them.\nPokémon Go is cracking down on players manipulating the game with third-party software, offenders claim. Instead of banning the players, though, developer Niantic is just making the game slightly worse for them.\nPlayers who are caught using third-party software to find rare Pokémon in Pokémon Go are not seeing the same kind of Pokémon that regular players are seeing, Pokémon Go Hub reported earlier this week. Ironically, the players using third-party software say they're only seeing boring, common Pokémon, no rare Pokémon.\nSEE ALSO: A Russian blogger may spend 3.5 years in jail for playing 'Pokémon Go' in a church\nHere's a photo example that Pokémon Go Hub shared. The left screen, an account flagged for manipulating the game, only shows a Geodude, while the normal account on the right shows three additional (and rarer) Pokémon in the same location.\n\nThe offending programs that could get an account flagged are called mappers and trackers. They augment the Pokémon Go app with extra information, showing players where certain Pokémon are likely to spawn and removing some of the mystery from the game.\nThis is an interesting way for Niantic to deter cheaters. Instead of outright banning players, Niantic is encouraging them to stop cheating and play the game as intended. The method they're using is called shadowbanning.\nAccording to one Reddit user, players who are flagged for cheating also receive this message, just in case they don't realize that the game isn't as good as it used to be.\n\nWATCH: Norwegian politician caught playing 'Pokémon Go' during defense hearing"},"shares":{"twitter":342,"google_plus":3,"facebook":36,"linked_in":4,"pinterest":1,"total":386},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/H6zzTraNhQ9cZbjt0qqNbjfmClc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F486260%2F9571e250-aef2-4516-98e9-6a902f720ee8.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/E1wmj0EB2zItnng90ZqQ0-AHtM8=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46618%2F6e3399c8-a907-43ea-ab20-dbdaca7c8d11.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/46SqIp8FN2H7HQ9E4DttHRAZmgE=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46618%2F6e3399c8-a907-43ea-ab20-dbdaca7c8d11.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PT_sLGW4exC0Um3pUVpHnS8zSK4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46618%2F6e3399c8-a907-43ea-ab20-dbdaca7c8d11.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YI2dA9PrqRappbwewKhYuctwzBo=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46618%2F6e3399c8-a907-43ea-ab20-dbdaca7c8d11.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-AroMpwKLo69JmZ_3pxhPZFX_Vo=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F46618%2F6e3399c8-a907-43ea-ab20-dbdaca7c8d11.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2rO0lc4","display_title":"Clever anti-cheat feature subtly makes 'Pokémon Go' worse for offenders","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"qeGlveYnkX","data-source":"blueprint","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Don't cheat, people.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Clever anti-cheat feature subtly makes 'Pokémon Go' worse for offenders"},{"_id":"591af7d128cc3636510000b3","id":"2017/05/16/pokemon-go-adventure-week-event","title":"'Pokémon Go' is holding a weeklong 'adventure' event","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-05-16T13:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 16 May 2017 13:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"05/16/2017","formatted_shares":"763","sort_key":"1DaFnw","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/16/pokemon-go-adventure-week-event/","content":{"plain":"Splendid news, trainers: starting Thursday, Pokémon Go will be running yet another event -- and this one's a whole week long.\nSEE ALSO: A Russian blogger was sentenced for playing 'Pokémon Go' in a church\nPokémon Go Adventure Week will run from Thursday 18 May (1 p.m. PDT) until Thursday 25 May (1 p.m. PDT). Continuing in the type-based theme of recent grass and water events, this one will be all about rock Pokémon.\nSo what exactly will the event involve?\nThere are four main points from Niantic's press release about the Adventure Week event:\n1. More rock-type Pokémon.\nAll rock-type Pokémon -- such as Omantye, Kabuto, Aerodactyl, Onix, and Sudowoodo -- will spawn more frequently during the event.\nNiantic list the specific Pokémon mentioned above as their examples, but the implication is that every Pokémon that's rock-type will be more common (including, we can only hope, Larvitar).\n\n2. More items from PokéStops.\nThroughout Adventure Week \"more items will be available at each PokéStop to help Trainers stock up for their adventure\".\n3. Faster buddy candy.\nThis is a nice one. The distance you have to walk with your buddy Pokémon to find a candy will be quartered during the Adventure Week event (it'll be the perfect time to start walking your newly-captured Larvitar, in other words).\n4. A brand new hat.\nLast but by no means least, there will be a brand new Adventurer's Hat item in the avatar wardrobe (because what good is going on an adventure if you can't do it in style, eh?).\nWATCH: How crazy your office gets when 'Pokémon Go' crashes"},"shares":{"google_plus":12,"twitter":437,"linked_in":3,"facebook":308,"pinterest":3,"total":763},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oB8Kyb3F3dxbDDqhISG-7BDRFTg=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F478165%2F400ce05f-06f5-4126-b880-a517ac89772d.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jikgJvTooDYJdWZkR2re2Fx6dCw=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45840%2F2270f6ff-40b2-46ed-865f-fabbad7699a9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MsuwkyDqTcdZ09LxX6z6n6JWi-k=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45840%2F2270f6ff-40b2-46ed-865f-fabbad7699a9.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/EKd_Q8zFLi9zHStl5Uwt6iKj0Hw=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45840%2F2270f6ff-40b2-46ed-865f-fabbad7699a9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Gdl4oyl_xHc9-XB9FMGdZN6tvrk=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45840%2F2270f6ff-40b2-46ed-865f-fabbad7699a9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/9cet1aMQRNjN1AfQJDs-MNVoSPA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F45840%2F2270f6ff-40b2-46ed-865f-fabbad7699a9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2qnAhGw","display_title":"'Pokémon Go' is holding a weeklong 'adventure' event","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"eYUYGOVE","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"More rock-type Pokémon are on their way....","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Pokémon Go' is holding a weeklong 'adventure' event"},{"_id":"590780d8f11b2c3058000066","id":"2017/05/01/pokemon-go-russia-church-arrest","title":"A Russian blogger may spend 3.5 years in jail for playing 'Pokémon Go' in a church","title_tag":null,"author":"Kellen Beck","post_date":"2017-05-01T18:39:18+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 01 May 2017 18:39:18 +0000","formatted_date":"05/01/2017","formatted_shares":"694","sort_key":"1D5gzm","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/05/01/pokemon-go-russia-church-arrest/","content":{"plain":"In Russia, playing Pokémon Go inside a church is apparently worthy of jail time.\nA 22-year-old Russian blogger was detained in September after publishing a video he took of himself playing Pokémon Go inside the Church of All Saints in Yekaterinburg, Russia. Prosecutors requested a sentence of 3.5 years in jail on Friday for \"inciting religious hatred,\" The Washington Post reported, and the final verdict will be delivered May 11.\nRuslan Sokolovsky posted the video in question in direct response to news that people can be fined or imprisoned in Russia for playing Pokémon Go in churches. Along with trying to catch Pokémon (and finding out that the church is in fact a PokéStop), he joked about Jesus in the video.\n\n\"But, you know, I didn't catch the rarest Pokémon that you could find there -- Jesus,\" he said in the video. \"But I couldn't help it. They say [he] doesn't even exist, so I'm not really surprised.\"\nSokolovsky has been on house arrest since being detained in September. \nSEE ALSO: 10 very inappropriate locations for Poke Stops in Pokémon Go\nAfter prosecutors requested his prison sentence Friday, Sokolovsky compared his punishment to those who were imprisoned for joking about communism under Stalin's rule, Meduza reported.\n\"I may be an idiot, but I am by no means an extremist,\" Sokolovksy said.\nThe charges levied against Sokolovsky stem from the arrest of two members of the punk collective Pussy Riot for staging a protest against Vladimir Putin at a Russian Orthodox church. After those arrests, the Russian government created a law that basically made it illegal to offend religious people.\nBack in September, Amnesty International called Sokolovsky's arrest an example of Putin's free speech crackdown.\n\"Ruslan is a prisoner of conscience, punished for peacefully expressing views – which he is perfectly entitled to do,\" the organization said.\nWATCH: Norwegian politician caught playing 'Pokémon Go' during defense hearing"},"shares":{"twitter":515,"linked_in":10,"facebook":158,"google_plus":8,"pinterest":3,"total":694},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/0osXryYf0oSlSSAiijt0x1zxr2E=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F463053%2F3bfdd0fa-4c6c-4b29-8d53-67a05b4e686e.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ilHItZj7tjZc5nwUpoCUESYrPeg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44363%2F4322d568-89bd-4459-a4f5-e9a6c654c4c2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/-r5cGtl7xglFKqGhIGyXVSrsrnY=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44363%2F4322d568-89bd-4459-a4f5-e9a6c654c4c2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SXTwsvAQzMqg7cBV6Wt3vaSY1-Y=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44363%2F4322d568-89bd-4459-a4f5-e9a6c654c4c2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YDiSJT87RSPSzJjHiM_XfgRiw7c=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44363%2F4322d568-89bd-4459-a4f5-e9a6c654c4c2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/vZ78XOKfYeRcFHFjBuPaRW8hwbU=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F44363%2F4322d568-89bd-4459-a4f5-e9a6c654c4c2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2oQCif3","display_title":"A Russian blogger may spend 3.5 years in jail for playing 'Pokémon Go' in a church","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"02vccCeF","data-source":"jwplayer","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"This punishment is extreme.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"A Russian blogger may spend 3.5 years in jail for playing 'Pokémon Go' in a church"},{"_id":"58efc41228cc3666ff000530","id":"2017/04/13/pokemon-go-easter-eggs","title":"Easter comes to 'Pokémon GO' with egg-stravagent bonuses","title_tag":null,"author":"Kellen Beck","post_date":"2017-04-13T18:31:40+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:31:40 +0000","formatted_date":"04/13/2017","formatted_shares":"433","sort_key":"1CYJwU","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/04/13/pokemon-go-easter-eggs/","content":{"plain":"Easter is just around the corner and Pokémon GO is celebrating with a limited-time Eggstravaganza.\nNo, you don't get any free eggs, but between April 13 to April 20 there will be double XP as well as some generous egg-related bonuses. \nThroughout the week, your 2 km eggs will have a chance to hatch more than just the low-tier Pokémon they currently do.

The most iconic shiny Pokémon, in the likes of Gold and Silver, was a red Gyarados that players encountered at the Lake of Rage -- the introduction of shiny Magikarp and Gyarados in Pokémon Go appears to be a homage to this.\nSo where are these shiny Pokémon hiding?\n\nIt's worth noting that the only shinies that appear to be available in the game, at least at the time of writing, are Magikarp and Gyarados. Chances are the rest will be rolled out soon, but for the time being -- probably until after the water event is over, if we had to guess -- it's just those two.\nThe other thing to note is that shiny Magikarp appear to look the same as regular Magikarp until you've tapped on them (you won't know they're a different color until you enter the capture screen, in other words).\nHappy hunting!\nWATCH: Pikachu looks amazing as a hologram"},"shares":{"facebook":70,"twitter":383,"google_plus":7,"linked_in":1,"pinterest":1,"total":462},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/q9wFTmJEMcGgKmaFrKuLbSmqBeM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40609%2F10d4c9f4-8cac-4a84-a5e4-e7d67511cf51.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/RY53vut33rCaXY7QAs0Zpha2zRU=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40609%2F10d4c9f4-8cac-4a84-a5e4-e7d67511cf51.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/PSTwaiUc6RNmBhf3vE_KnENA6dM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40609%2F10d4c9f4-8cac-4a84-a5e4-e7d67511cf51.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/icgFGkub8HLKDYDecJN09z68YAk=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40609%2F10d4c9f4-8cac-4a84-a5e4-e7d67511cf51.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/jrqOFo3sTDsI4uexUmJatD-HkIA=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40609%2F10d4c9f4-8cac-4a84-a5e4-e7d67511cf51.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/hhn6R5Aw7pLNeZezAb8ZCFnb0G4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F40609%2F10d4c9f4-8cac-4a84-a5e4-e7d67511cf51.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2mUodaz","display_title":"New shiny Pokémon have started appearing in 'Pokémon Go'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"OUzvbkAt","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"That is one badass Gyarados.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"New shiny Pokémon have started appearing in 'Pokémon Go'"},{"_id":"58d293d7f11b2c1864000212","id":"2017/03/22/pokemon-go-water-festival","title":"For the next week, 'Pokémon Go' makes it easier to find Water-type critters","title_tag":null,"author":"Adam Rosenberg","post_date":"2017-03-22T15:10:07+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:10:07 +0000","formatted_date":"03/22/2017","formatted_shares":"337","sort_key":"1CQIM5","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/03/22/pokemon-go-water-festival/","content":{"plain":"It's time for a Pokémon Go pool party.\nThe latest in-game event for The Pokémon Company's hit mobile game connects to the Water Festival.

If a player wins enough battles against a gym's leader(s), they take control of it (or join it if their team already has control of it) and select a Pokémon to defend the gym against other players.\nWhile it can feel cool to take over a gym, the battle system is very rudimentary and not particularly enjoyable, and players never actually interact with the players they are attacking or defending against. \nNiantic CEO John Hanke told Wired earlier this year that the gym feature is very limited and that the developer intends to change the gym system, mentioning more teamwork and better rewards to incentivize players.\nPolygon said Niantic is expecting to rework the gym system sometime in 2017.\nWATCH: Norwegian politician caught playing 'Pokémon Go' during defense hearing"},"shares":{"google_plus":24,"linked_in":11,"twitter":575,"facebook":100,"pinterest":3,"total":713},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GYemID4tZjyXS4dGw4w_ZbKTWUw=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F410569%2F04759d41-06e7-44eb-b340-43ec6fd45203.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6ChXrfBf1FtgGtQU-jCtCKmNsKA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39323%2F2c6b671a-2a23-471d-be5e-88d62ecdfbcd.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3z3O2shaj2g85C1mcQmupmwG3wM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39323%2F2c6b671a-2a23-471d-be5e-88d62ecdfbcd.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/6kYkbh9egOlECwoklZ97y6xZtpw=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39323%2F2c6b671a-2a23-471d-be5e-88d62ecdfbcd.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/KWO9_-dnHT14r0f9AOIaA6iRkB4=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39323%2F2c6b671a-2a23-471d-be5e-88d62ecdfbcd.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/HsMz71UW9VOrlz-FPsiOWpPYtx4=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F39323%2F2c6b671a-2a23-471d-be5e-88d62ecdfbcd.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2msrJtS","display_title":"'Pokémon Go' developers feel you: Gyms need to be improved","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"02vccCeF","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"The competitive part of 'Pokémon Go' isn't very fun.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Pokémon Go' developers feel you: Gyms need to be improved"},{"_id":"58a7286028cc362cac000429","id":"2017/02/17/cincinnati-cemetery-pokemon-go","title":"Local Cincinnati cemetery wants 'Pokémon Go' players out","title_tag":null,"author":"Tina Amini","post_date":"2017-02-17T16:44:08+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:44:08 +0000","formatted_date":"02/17/2017","formatted_shares":"484","sort_key":"1CELDG","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/17/cincinnati-cemetery-pokemon-go/","content":{"plain":"Pokémon Go players have found themselves wandering all over the world in search of resources, new Pokémon and battles with or against friends. But not everyone is happy to see the uptick in wandering players with their noses buried into their phones.\nSEE ALSO: 'Pokémon Go' craze leads to new permit requirements for ARGs\nAccording to local news channel WKRC, The St. Joseph's Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, hasn't been too pleased that Pokémon Go players are showing up for PokeStops. It's also apparently not the first time the cemetery has tried to post signs to discourage players from entering.\n\nIn the local channel's news report above, superintendent Joe Windt explains that players will drive through services unfazed, even running into trees. It wouldn't be the first time a Pokémon Go player accidentally wandered off too far because they didn't look up from their phone.\nBut, seriously, how fast could they have been going to produce this damage? How old was this tree??\n\nIt's also not the first cemetery to react against Pokémon Go players' presence. Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum, for example, was once frequented by Pokémon Go players due to the plentiful virtual resources that could be found there. Though the stops have since been removed, the cemetery's vice president of operations, Gerald Wantz, decided to handle matters differently at the time. According to a Cincinnati report on his press release, Wantz simply asked that anyone entering the cemetery wear a shirt and exhibit a modicum of respect for others not there for the ripe Pokémon action. Definitely reasonable enough.\nAnother Cincinnati gravesite actually embraced the Pokémon presence. Zachary Henzerling, who is buried at Arlington Memorial Gardens, was a big fan of Pokémon himself, and his family was delighted to find out that his tombstone was actually a gym where other players would gather to battle. They even left a sweet note welcoming those players.\n\nNiantic, the developer behind the game, has yet to directly address St. Joseph's Cemetery's request to have the PokeStops removed, but their general policy in their terms of service requires that players \"will not inflict emotional distress on other people, will not humiliate other people (publicly or otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people, will not enter onto private property without permission...\" \nThe company generally selects locations for their stops and gyms that are both safe and public property, though there are means by which people can request them to be taken down.\nMany other cemeteries across the U.S., not just Cincinnati, have posted signs trying to ban Pokémon Go players from entering. Some have managed to get their PokeStops removed. Others find ways to bond with the bigger community of players out there who enjoy peaceful (and respectful) walks through the sites.\nBONUS: Nintendo has reinvented the party game"},"shares":{"facebook":164,"twitter":312,"google_plus":6,"pinterest":2,"total":484},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lMir4-lgJ8E50aFSdi0ZMtVgCas=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F387375%2Fe5d14529-db7d-4ebe-9958-0ff27ad50ddd.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Zcnd3GW5WBU3LWteAarN5y_7Plg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37184%2F15a734a2-79f5-45ef-b0d3-3b3d761ea0b4.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/quJpEjwPpcopnlCJ0WId8pBMVw8=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37184%2F15a734a2-79f5-45ef-b0d3-3b3d761ea0b4.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Cqi4wEq_i4VImN_xxz9QvLdX7Y4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37184%2F15a734a2-79f5-45ef-b0d3-3b3d761ea0b4.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3pIntvtirMEPedjyVWJAz7MyeAs=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37184%2F15a734a2-79f5-45ef-b0d3-3b3d761ea0b4.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2t6XRgPalWBY07qxdx4-WNAzXdA=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F37184%2F15a734a2-79f5-45ef-b0d3-3b3d761ea0b4.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2lrhzM7","display_title":"Local Cincinnati cemetery wants 'Pokémon Go' players out","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"wukZvOqc","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"They're posting signs to keep them out.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Local Cincinnati cemetery wants 'Pokémon Go' players out"},{"_id":"58a478e7f11b2c62c800037c","id":"2017/02/15/professor-willow-pokemon-go-worst","title":"Professor Willow from 'Pokémon Go' needs to be immediately sacked","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-02-15T15:50:52+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:50:52 +0000","formatted_date":"02/15/2017","formatted_shares":"564","sort_key":"1CE1R2","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/15/professor-willow-pokemon-go-worst/","content":{"plain":"LONDON -- As someone who's been life-alteringly addicted to Pokémon Go for over seven months now, I feel I'm as qualified as anyone to make the following statement: Professor Willow, as helpful as he may occasionally seem, needs to lose his job.\nThe guy is literally the worst professor in the world. \nSEE ALSO: Charmander and friends come to life in artist's Pokémon renderings\nTo begin with it sort of seemed like he knew what he was doing.

There are also a whole new set of Gen 2 legendaries that we obviously won't be getting yet (we still don't have the Gen 1 legendaries, after all).\nEven taking into account the eight existing Gen 2s and six legendaries, though, that still leaves seven Pokémon unaccounted for. Our best guess is that these are the likes of Unown and Wobbuffet -- essentially the Gen 2 equivalents of Ditto, which may require special moves or additions that will need to be added over the coming weeks/months.\nTwo new berries\n\nThis is pretty exciting. \nTo increase your options when capturing a Pokémon, Niantic are adding two brand new berries to the game: the Pinap Berry and the Nanab Berry.\nThe Nanab Berry slows down a Pokémon's movements to make it easier to catch, while the Pinap Berry -- which is a bit of a game-changer, in our opinion -- means the candy you receive for a Pokémon will be doubled if your next catch attempt is successful.\nThere's currently no word on the level these berries are unlocked at or how they're acquired (we're assuming they'll come out of Pokéstops like their Razz Berry cousins).\nEvolution stones\nEvolution items were first hinted at in the data mine of the January update, and they've now been officially confirmed.\nDetails are thin at this stage -- we know for sure that these will be used to evolve certain Gen 1 Pokémon (like Onix and Seadra) into their new Gen 2 evolutions, but we don't know exactly how the stones will be acquired in the game.\nAvatar customisation\nWhat's the point in being the best like no one ever was if you can't look cool doing it, right?\nLuckily, the latest update has taken into account our in-game avatars, too, who will soon be able to dress themselves in \"a new selection of hats, shirts, pants, and other items\".\nThese will be available from the in-game shop, according to the press release.\n“Today is a momentous occasion for our team here at Niantic which has been hard at work to deliver these additional Pokémon and build upon the encounter and capture mechanics for our passionate global community of Trainers playing Pokémon Go,” Niantic founder and CEO John Hanke was quoted as saying.\n“Pokémon Go is a live experience which we’ll be continuing to support and evolve in new and interesting ways for years to come with new gameplay features, in-game and live events, more Pokémon to discover and much more.”\nIt's officially time to get excited.\nUPDATE: Feb. 15, 2017, 12:14 p.m. GMT An official update has been published on Pokémon Go Live that confirms Evolution items and new berries will be available from PokéStops, and that Pokémon may \"react in new ways\" when encountered in the wild.\nBONUS: Pikachu looks amazing as a

So if Niantic wants to have active PokeStops and Gyms in a Milwaukee park, for example, it would need to seek approval from the local government.\nSEE ALSO: 7 things 'Pokémon Go' badly needs in 2017\nThe issue first sprung up in July 2016, when Pokémon Go launched. Larger-than-normal crowds turned up to chase Pokémon at Milwaukee's 138-acre Lake Park, and the resulting costs of enforcement and clean-up -- which were higher than normal -- fell to taxpayers.\nThe ordinance was introduced, then, to ensure that liability falls to the right parties. A permitting process gives the local government a mechanism for holding the ARG creator -- in this case, Niantic -- accountable when its game places an unnecessary cost on taxpayers.\nAccording to the text of the ordinance, the large crowds in Lake Park last summer resulted in \"increased litter and waste in the park, inadequate bathrooms to accommodate the high ratio of people, after-hours violations, enhanced security oversight, unauthorized vendors, significant daily traffic congestion, parking violations, trampled grass, and related concerns about sensitive flora and fauna areas.\"\nYou can view video evidence of the Lake Park crowds here and here as well as a Powerpoint doc presenting photographic evidence of the mess that was left behind. \nThe ordinance has been debated a number of times in Milwaukee County: twice by the Parks, Energy, and Environment Committee and twice -- including the most recent debate -- by the Board of Supervisors. You can find video from all but one of these meetings right here.\nIt's important to note that, although the ordinance received a \"yes\" vote in committee, it isn't yet the rule of law. It could still be vetoed at the executive level, though that could be overturned by a committee vote (they'll be meeting again on Feb. 16).\nEven if you're not interested in Pokémon Go, the videos and legal documentation provide a fascinating peek into the inner workings of local government. It's definitely worth a look.\nBONUS: These augmented reality robots will turn your living room into a battlefield"},"shares":{"facebook":152,"twitter":560,"google_plus":17,"pinterest":1,"linked_in":5,"total":735},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/soJHGmiCoyBkFy-g0ESuQvH45-s=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F375725%2F74592ff4-e8d9-48b9-bd52-08abfa435928.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oLb30QRoqaMESqZ_FJJq2n-NBJ0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36093%2Fd628951b-479d-4f96-828b-900d1701f033.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ZY38l95WuexmYpi8yDXoEeD3l-s=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36093%2Fd628951b-479d-4f96-828b-900d1701f033.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/3ZmIFEmvKhV8N5nuz98YLnIX-Fg=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36093%2Fd628951b-479d-4f96-828b-900d1701f033.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/_1_NPSUECPszJQTuvuKcTh1s-VM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36093%2Fd628951b-479d-4f96-828b-900d1701f033.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/XmWoohG6wJ3ip4Qy3DsGBcoEzSs=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F36093%2Fd628951b-479d-4f96-828b-900d1701f033.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2koPp3e","display_title":"'Pokémon Go' craze leads to new permit requirements for ARGs","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"unmtCfUg","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Gotta catch 'em all, without breaking the law.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"'Pokémon Go' craze leads to new permit requirements for ARGs"},{"_id":"58959f1b28cc364772000932","id":"2017/02/04/pokemon-go-game-ideas-2017","title":"7 things 'Pokémon Go' badly needs in 2017","title_tag":null,"author":"Sam Haysom","post_date":"2017-02-04T09:30:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 04 Feb 2017 09:30:00 +0000","formatted_date":"02/04/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1CzXsN","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/02/04/pokemon-go-game-ideas-2017/","content":{"plain":"LONDON -- I feel like I should make one thing clear up front: I love Pokémon Go.\nSEE ALSO: Charmander and friends come to life in artist's Pokémon renderings\nSince I first downloaded the game last July, I don't think a day's gone by without me opening up the app. That might sound sad to some people -- probably the same people who gleefully comment \"dead\" every single time Niantic tweet -- but that doesn't really bother me.\nI still enjoy playing the game, and anyone who's been on thriving Reddit communities like The Silph Road (or read how much money Niantic apparently made in 2016) will know that it's a long way from dead. \nThat's not to say it isn't deeply frustrating, though. Despite Niantic making a bunch of great updates and events in 2016, Pokémon Go is still a long way from the experience showcased in the game trailer released way back in September 2015. A long way.\nI'm not going to bang on about the reasons why here. Instead I've listed below some of the features/improvements that I'd like to see in 2017. I've tried to steer clear of the more obvious ones like Gen 2, because we already know that's on its way...\n\n1.

As a regular player, nothing frustrates me more than Niantic's lack of communication with their audience. I know they've improved since the days of endless silence that accompanied last summer's server issues. But there still seems to be a huge disconnect from their player base, which -- at times -- borders on arrogance.\nTake January for example. It's now been around six weeks since the Christmas event was announced, and in the time since we've heard diddly-squat. There's been a vague newsletter bouncing around for the last month alluding to a \"special message from Professor Willow\" that never arrived, and the meagre release notes accompanying the last two updates... and that's it.\nI understand they're trying to hold things back as surprises, but when I see the negative reaction the lack of information drums up on social media, it seems as though this strategy is doing more harm than good.\n\n2. Global gym rankings.\n\nThere's been a lot of discussion lately about the lack of endgame in Pokémon Go. Because once you've caught all the Pokémon available in your region, what else is there to do?\nLevelling up, strengthening your Pokémon squad and battling in gyms are the current solutions, but they can only go so far. Taking over a gym only to get booted out again 20 minutes later is wearing, and the whole process is ultimately a repetitive one.\nIf there was a bigger picture -- rankings showing the number of gyms your team controls worldwide (or even drilled down by country/city) -- it would be a good start. Longterm there could even be individual player rankings showing how many gyms you control/how many enemy gyms you've taken down compared to your local teammates.\n\n3. TMs and (possibly) HMs.\n\nIf there's one thing my two Twister Gyarados have taught me, it's that this game could really do with some TMs. For anyone who didn't play the original games, TMs are Technical Machines -- essentially single-use items that allow you to teach a specific move to one of your Pokémon which over-rides one of the moves they already know.\nNot only would this cancel out some of the rage associated with finally evolving a strong monster only to discover a useless moveset -- it would also make for a hell of a lot more variety in gym battles.\nLongterm, who knows? Maybe they could even find a way of incorporating HMs (the Hidden Machines that teach Pokémon special ability moves that can be used outside of battle) into the game. I haven't exactly thought this one through, but maybe \"Strength\" could be used to give your squad a power boost for a limited time, or \"Fly\" could be a one-use-a-month power that jumps you to another city in the world for 30 minutes (your avatar could hover over buildings as if you were actually flying while you catch the Pokémon that spawn in that region).\n\n4. Status effects and more sophisticated battles.\n\nA key part of Pokémon battles in the original games were Status Effects -- conditions like paralysis and sleep that could be inflicted on an enemy 'mon during a fight, and which would require berries (or a trip to the Pokémon Center) to cure.\nWhile other berries that are not currently active in the game have been discovered in the code we've yet to see a hint of any items related to Status Effects. But wouldn't they make gyms a lot more interesting? \nPoison, confusion, and sleep would add a whole other dimension to battles, and might make Pokémon with weaker stats that little bit more useful.\n\n5. The introduction of Team Rocket...\n\nIdeas involving Team Rocket -- the ever-present enemies of Ash & Co. who pop up in the games under a variety of different names -- regularly appear in the Pokémon Go subreddit. Reddit user Inkubator suggested that Team Rocket could take over gyms during every nest migration, for example. Others have pitched the idea of a Team Rocket-themed event.\nIntroducing them into the game could certainly add an interesting wild-card element. They could be used to unite opposing teams, level the playing field in terms of gyms, or simply provide an interesting side quest that could work alongside day-to-day play.\n\n6. ...Or another form of NPC.\n\nIn a recent Reddit thread discussing new feature ideas for the game, Reddit user BuckNut2000 pitched the possibility of random non-player character (NPC) battles -- basically computer-controlled trainers who would pop up on the map and give you the chance to battle for items.\nI love this idea. Trainer battles were a key part of the Game Boy games, and their implementation in Pokémon Go would open up a whole new element.\nMaybe Niantic could even take things a step further and introduce a \"rival\" character who pops up once a month to challenge you, and whose squad gets that little bit stronger every time you meet. Perhaps one day the app will even get its own, adapted version of the elite four.\n\n7. Legendary quests.\n\nI don't want the legendary Pokémon -- whenever they do finally get introduced -- to come too easy. If Pokémon Go is to remain faithful to the series, I think we should have to work for those birds and that spooky walking cat.\nThe introduction of some kind of quest -- another term that often crops up in the Reddit forums -- could be a good solution to this. \nMaybe, instead of simply being an extra-rare spawn in the wild, the legendary birds could be hatched from 100K eggs that can only be acquired once you've completed some other mission set by Professor Willow? Maybe we could get notified by Willow that they'll be spawning at a certain point in our local area at a specific time/place, and we have to venture out to battle them?\nOr maybe -- just maybe -- we'll one day see an event like the one advertised in the trailer, where groups of players converge at a meeting point to join forces in an attempt to capture Mewtwo.\nBONUS: Pikachu looks amazing as a hologram"},"shares":{"facebook":430,"google_plus":29,"twitter":702,"pinterest":2,"linked_in":16,"total":1179},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/C7QB_oJxzjhwiX9i_tDjlMErN8M=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F370107%2F7477e589-bc92-494d-b6e2-ac9935d124a5.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/USrY3vJ9pediFObZAzEXIAyQwIg=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F35008%2F6bd285cc-4601-4c8d-a67f-5a74ef0300a5.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/WRpAxysQmx186Sdpjmz93K9CEpM=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F35008%2F6bd285cc-4601-4c8d-a67f-5a74ef0300a5.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AejkBm190_wb3fgRHlpQgrxgLZU=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F35008%2F6bd285cc-4601-4c8d-a67f-5a74ef0300a5.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7T4KdfUGxui6DGNwshMyjUILn_8=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F35008%2F6bd285cc-4601-4c8d-a67f-5a74ef0300a5.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/eQMJ8rlGnxNsXAAEfOxTWEHd888=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F35008%2F6bd285cc-4601-4c8d-a67f-5a74ef0300a5.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2l7dMRo","display_title":"7 things 'Pokémon Go' badly needs in 2017","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"OUzvbkAt","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"TMs, quests, and Team Rocket...","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"7 things 'Pokémon Go' badly needs in 2017"},{"_id":"5886f30df11b2c7996000e96","id":"2017/01/24/pokemon-go-south-korea","title":"'Pokémon Go' finally launches in South Korea","title_tag":null,"author":"Victoria Ho","post_date":"2017-01-24T06:24:09+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 06:24:09 +0000","formatted_date":"01/24/2017","formatted_shares":"500","sort_key":"1CvUwx","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/01/24/pokemon-go-south-korea/","content":{"plain":"Pokémon Go has finally come to South Korea, more than six months after the global phenomenon launched in other regions.\nWhile the South Korean smartphone market is among the more advanced globally, it took months for the mobile game to be released there because of government restrictions on Google Maps, which the game relies on.\nSEE ALSO: 'Pokémon Go' banned in China over public safety concerns\nSouth Korea's national security laws prevent companies like Google from exporting government-provided map data, which is necessary to power Pokémon Go's functions.\nAccording to Korean media, the game's maker Niantic Labs had to figure out a workaround for its map in South Korea, so as not violate the law.

The campaign aims to remind attendees of the world's most pressing issues, and why they should be priorities at the conference.\nSEE ALSO: Your passion for 'Pokémon Go' can help fund your favorite charity\nEach of the 17 new PokéStops — where players can collect items and catch more Pokémon — represents one of the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals, also know as the Global Goals. From ending poverty and hunger to achieving gender equality and taking climate action, these goals act as a blueprint to make a better world by the year 2030.\nThe Davos Congress Centre, which hosts the World Economic Forum meetings every year, is also acting as a Pokémon Go Gym, where the three teams in the game can train and battle.\n\n\"With Pokémon Go, the world is our playground,\" Tsunekazu Ishihara, president of The Pokémon Company International, said in a statement. \"And when the world is your playground, you want it to be as beautiful and safe as possible. That's why we're delighted to play a part in driving the awareness of the Global Goals.\"\n\"When the world is your playground, you want it to be as beautiful and safe as possible.\"\nIn the lead-up to September 2015, when 193 world leaders officially agreed to the goals, Project Everyone helped rebrand them as the \"Global Goals\" to make them more accessible and allow everyone to understand their role in reaching them.\nThe Davos campaign seems to further that mission, pointing toward the impact of younger generations and reminding powerful decision-makers attending the conference of their responsibility to create positive change.\nThis kind of targeting makes sense; the World Economic Forum aims to forge collaborations across public, private and not-for-profit sectors to \"shape the global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year.\" While Davos is often criticized for its extravagance and for amounting to an overwhelmingly male congregation of global elites, social impact frequently factors into the meetings' conversations. This year, the Global Goals feature prominently in branding and badging throughout the conference.\n\"It's brilliant to see Pokémon Go joining the fight to achieve a sustainable world by 2030 and taking the game to Davos,\" said David Nabarro, special adviser to the U.N. Secretary-General on sustainable development and climate change. \"Business and finance are the change agents that will spur innovation, unleash investments and see the SDGs achieved.\"\n\nStarting in spring 2017, there will be additional in-game content available to players, which will continue to promote the Global Goals.\n\"We've always wanted both Niantic and Pokémon Go to be a force for good in the world,\" John Hanke, founder of Niantic, said in a statement.\n\"We are extremely proud to partner with the Global Goals campaign to help remind people of how critically important the Goals are, while hopefully keeping the world's leaders focused on delivering on them.”\n\nYou can find more information on the 17 PokéStops' locations below.\n17 Davos PokéStops\nGoal 1 -

In the main Pokémon games, specific Pokémon that hold these items and are traded to another player will evolve. Here's a breakdown of how the items evolve different Pokémon:\nDragon Scale:\n\n  Seadra evolves into Kingdra\n\nKing's Rock:\n\n  Poliwhirl evolves into Politoed\n  Slowpoke evolves into Slowking\n\nMetal Coat:\n\n  Onix evolves into Steelix\n  Scyther evolves into Scizor\n\nSun Stone:\n\n  Gloom evolves into Bellossom\n\nUp-Grade:\n\n  Porygon evolves into Porygon2\n\nThe code also suggests that the Pokémon called Unknown will be making an appearance in Pokémon Go. Unknown are Pokémon that are shaped like letters of the alphabet (plus two punctuation marks), and all of them from Unknown A to Unknown Z are present in the code.\n\nOutside of the Unknowns, the new Pokémon possibilities fall in line with how Pokémon Go has introduced second generation Pokémon so far, namely, in relation to current Pokémon. \nThe first new batch of Pokémon released in December were all the baby versions of already-present first generation Pokémon like Pichu and Togepi. Continuing to release new Pokémon that already have ties to the current roster wouldn't come as a surprise.\n\nThe datamine also teases some other new features like more customization for players' avatars -- including the addition of belts, glasses and necklaces -- and 38 brand new moves to spice up your Pokémon battles. We'll have to wait on future game updates to know for sure.\nBONUS: Norwegian politician caught playing 'Pokémon Go' during defense hearing"},"shares":{"facebook":450,"twitter":377,"google_plus":6,"pinterest":2,"linked_in":12,"total":847},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/lJXfk5EpLRUDp1qaHiO_ljj6Jac=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F352111%2Fb1189210-c783-4e58-bfc4-81518ec482c3.png","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ePfLfUbZnwafyZzHYqwBmzF7wpM=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F33973%2F381de94e-c4f6-4314-925d-832479180f2f.png","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/AQBNhSbE5gVEP1FNuBPFWG2FLDA=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F33973%2F381de94e-c4f6-4314-925d-832479180f2f.png","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/ONTFGhVhDXBLO4fGfom1i6uXSEI=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F33973%2F381de94e-c4f6-4314-925d-832479180f2f.png","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/oJWO4fpI9qznLFvpjGdBmxXrgfE=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F33973%2F381de94e-c4f6-4314-925d-832479180f2f.png","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Q4RSbBVZCR81bG1GhXDkBpWdpIc=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F33973%2F381de94e-c4f6-4314-925d-832479180f2f.png","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2jLcSsO","display_title":"New Pokémon are coming to 'Pokémon Go', datamine suggests","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"02vccCeF","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"All new gen-two evolution items and more were found in the game's code.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"New Pokémon are coming to 'Pokémon Go', datamine suggests"},{"_id":"5875499b6df6120e28000010","id":"2017/01/10/pokemon-go-banned-china","title":"'Pokémon Go' banned in China over public safety concerns","title_tag":null,"author":"Raymond Wong","post_date":"2017-01-10T20:52:41+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 20:52:41 +0000","formatted_date":"01/10/2017","formatted_shares":"1.2k","sort_key":"1Cr3Qc","link":"http://mashable.com/2017/01/10/pokemon-go-banned-china/","content":{"plain":"The world's most populous country will not be getting Pokémon Go. \nApparently, China thinks the game is just too dangerous to allow due to public safety concerns, according to Reuters.\nSEE ALSO: 'Pokémon Go' will serve up free goodies on Christmas Day\nChina's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television cites \"a high level of responsibility to national security and the safety of people's lives and property\" and a \"threat to geographical information security and the threat to transport and the personal safety of consumers\" as reasons for Pokémon Go's ban.\nIn other words, China thinks you're just not responsible enough to play the game.

Especially following the months-long lull after the game's instantaneous post-launch success seemingly ground developer Niantic's continued work to a halt.\nThe Pokémon Go app for Apple Watch should be available in the App Store now.\nBONUS: These augmented reality robots will turn your living room into a battlefield"},"shares":{"twitter":492,"facebook":126,"google_plus":16,"total":634},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/MStIOI40BJ20cZM0aFABjCEWMwc=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F327297%2F0f816275-47a1-43ce-b8cb-89b0f6b67a4c.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/uaFPtHkwwtVldrbcKqKWtIZXBSc=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31710%2Fcd8853d3-4491-4446-ab8b-a9fbf5be32f1.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/7EU8rdUlWOO8YGWLe1l8su9mcqQ=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31710%2Fcd8853d3-4491-4446-ab8b-a9fbf5be32f1.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/z3SuK1WeJUNhFxrfMmJKEesGSY4=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31710%2Fcd8853d3-4491-4446-ab8b-a9fbf5be32f1.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/SkVgJucLvkLiVJaSdQkrzD9w8rY=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31710%2Fcd8853d3-4491-4446-ab8b-a9fbf5be32f1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/YMsGn7_foXBr8wuIpngXO5BkNYI=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F31710%2Fcd8853d3-4491-4446-ab8b-a9fbf5be32f1.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hZD3y6","display_title":"You can finally play 'Pokémon Go' on an Apple Watch","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-id":"unmtCfUg","data-template":"bonus"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"One, last holiday surprise from 'Pokémon Go' and the team at Niantic.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"You can finally play 'Pokémon Go' on an Apple Watch"},{"_id":"5859a124f11b2c1f72000391","id":"2016/12/20/pokemon-go-mileage-numbers","title":"'Pokémon Go' players have walked around the earth more than 200,000 times","title_tag":null,"author":"Sasha Lekach","post_date":"2016-12-20T21:22:41+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 21:22:41 +0000","formatted_date":"12/20/2016","formatted_shares":"1.6k","sort_key":"1CjDYw","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/12/20/pokemon-go-mileage-numbers/","content":{"plain":"In the six months since the Pokémon Go mobile game dropped, players have been putting in some serious effort. \nEveryone seemed to drop everything when the game was released in July and all that searching for Pokémon has paid off -- users have collectively walked 8.7 billion kilometers, or 5.4 billion miles, according to Niantic Labs (the company behind the game) in a blog post Tuesday.\nSEE ALSO: So much complaining: 'Super Mario Run' will destroy your data and drain your wallet\nThe gaming company made a video to show how far we've gone to catch the digital creatures.

I just felt left out.\"\nOver the course of three months, Pinvidic talked to about 100 people for the film. \nThroughout the filming process, Pinvidic also ends up connecting with his 13-year-old daughter, an avid Pokémon Go player.\n\"It really was a perfectly designed game at a perfectly timed moment,\" Pinvidic said of the mobile game. \"The use of augmented reality with the hunting outside and the community it created was brilliant. I think with everyone so attached to their digital lives and their screens people we hungry for something that would get them to engage with other people sharing a common interest. That is the one thing I really saw throughout making the film, people had something to talk to each other about.\"\nThe film expands on Pinvidic's \"Why I’m Not On ...\" series, which will be developed as a documentary series for 2017 in a partnership with STX Entertainment. Pinvidic first launched with the film Why I'm Not on Facebook in 2015.\n\n\"[While making the movie], I learned to be a better dad to my daughter,\" Pinvidic said. \"I also learned that if something is wildly popular and everyone is enjoying it, there is a very good chance there is a very good reason.

From the looks of their announcement they're planning to gradually roll out the full 100 Pokémon over \"the next few months,\" and they've started with a logical group: the babies.\nGen II, for anyone who is not too familiar, introduced eight \"baby\" Pokémon into the game: six that are essentially mini versions of Pokémon from Generation I, and two that can evolve into new Pokémon.\nAt the time of writing, seven of these appear to be available to hatch in the game...\nPichu.\nI just hatched this from a 5 km egg - NOT a 2 km one. @trnrtips #PokemonGO #Pokemongogen2 pic.twitter.com/7rlkw51R9U— Leia (WhiteLayer) (@darknessdescend) December 13, 2016\n\nThe baby form of Pikachu.

More interestingly, though, he doesn't evolve into a Generation I Pokémon; he evolves into Togetic, a new adult Pokémon from Gen II. At the time of writing, I've yet to see anyone post a picture of Togetic (from the looks of the announcement video Togepi can evolve after 50 candies).\nElekid.\nBut I would walk 500 meters and I would walk 500 more.

But you're missing out Tyrogue @PokemonGoApp ! #PokemonGO pic.twitter.com/m3dsHruK9j— k i r s t . (@teumessianvulpe) December 12, 2016\n\nSo: there are eight babies in Gen II, but only seven are currently available -- what's the deal?\nWell, the eighth baby is slightly more complicated than the others. Tyrogue (pictured above) is a baby that (like Eevee) can evolve into three different possible Pokémon: Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, and -- another new one -- Hitmontop.\nAt the time of writing there's no sign of Tyrogue in the game. If Niantic are going to do this rollout in stages though, he'd be the logical next step. \n\nWhat's next?\nIt's tricky to say how the rest of the Gen II rollout will happen, but it's worth noting there are a bunch of Gen II Pokémon that evolve from existing Gen I Pokémon. Some of these are new third stage evolutions (Seadra evolves into Kingdra, for instance), while others are \"split\" evolutions (in Gen II Slowpoke can evolve into either Slowbro or Slowking).\nThere's a handy Reddit thread detailing all of these here.\nIf we had to guess, we'd say Niantic's next step might be getting the (admittedly quite useless) Professor Willow to \"discover\" these new evolutions. Maybe that'll happen in the New Year, maybe before.\nAnd after that? Well, then it's time to make way for the rest of Gen II...\n\nBONUS: How crazy your office gets when 'Pokémon Go' crashes"},"shares":{"facebook":5796,"twitter":364,"google_plus":11,"linked_in":5,"total":6176},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/nsqpjIaxRyUl4kYNNbS6boAgcSM=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30715%2FNew_Pokemon_Gen_2.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/gLvivswlyEJ77Ka5ruPDHHKpbQA=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30715%2FNew_Pokemon_Gen_2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/l8AArakfNiC4CFgAYxTOzuIQQjU=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30715%2FNew_Pokemon_Gen_2.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/iuAqorEjNZfxXBr5RI-9o2RvH98=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30715%2FNew_Pokemon_Gen_2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/TCVzr9DHwa3KWlMpMT0vh6TOZRc=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30715%2FNew_Pokemon_Gen_2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/wr6TSZHLIbBJII-VAC6j9QVXUjw=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30715%2FNew_Pokemon_Gen_2.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hpNkjJ","display_title":"Here are all the new Pokémon you can get in 'Pokémon Go'","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"3O4oKYpndV","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"Get out and hatch those eggs, people.","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Entertainment","channel_label":"Entertainment","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/entertainment/","tweet_text":"Here are all the new Pokémon you can get in 'Pokémon Go'"},{"_id":"584fd306f11b2c7b3c000f7d","id":"2016/12/13/pokemon-go-india-launch-reliance-jio","title":"'Pokémon Go' is officially launching in India tomorrow","title_tag":null,"author":"Manish Singh","post_date":"2016-12-13T10:52:51+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 10:52:51 +0000","formatted_date":"12/13/2016","formatted_shares":"17.7k","sort_key":"1CgNS8","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/12/13/pokemon-go-india-launch-reliance-jio/","content":{"plain":"Indians can finally join the rest of the world in chasing Pokémons with their smartphones. \nSleeper hit title Pokémon Go is finally coming to India, Reliance Jio announced today. The 4G LTE-only carrier has partnered with Niantic, publisher and developer of Pokémon GO. The game will be available to download in the country starting Wednesday. \nSEE ALSO: New Pokemon are coming to 'Pokémon Go'\nThe partnership between the two companies means that thousands of Reliance Digital Stores and select other partner premises will turn into 'PokèStops' or 'Gyms', places where you’re likely to find most Pokèmon characters.\nUsers will find exclusive Pokèmon Go Channel in Reliance Jio’s social messaging app, JioChat. This will enabled them to socialize with other players and level-up faster, Reliance Jio said. \n\"We are delighted to partner with Jio to launch Pokémon GO in India,” said John Hanke, Chief Executive Officer and founder of Niantic in a press statement.  \n\"It’s exciting to see Pokémon fans in India step out and explore their neighbourhoods in search of Pokémon and Jio’s disruptive high speed 4G LTE Network will be an excellent way to experience the game,” he added. Reliance Jio's offering is also exciting as it is offering a bulk of 4G LTE data to more than 50 million subscribers for free. \nFirst unveiled in July this year, Pokémon Go has become a global sensation with over 500 million downloads. The game disrupted lives of many, pushing some to exercise more, or to go out more often. However, at the same time, so much was its craze that many people put their and others’ lives to risk in their quest of catching virtual monsters. \nThough Pokémon Go wasn’t officially launched in India, many people had force-installed the game and sightings of people running looking at phones in public places became a common thing in India too. \nSo much so, that a Gujarat-based resident went to the court alleging that the augmented-reality game was hurting the sentiment of people by showing eggs in religious places such as temples.\nBONUS: This super precise handwriting robot is so satisfying to watch"},"shares":{"facebook":17178,"google_plus":13,"twitter":463,"pinterest":1,"linked_in":36,"total":17691},"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/B-Vx4pP2AMFkXSnUS5LIacuXMAU=/950x534/filters:quality(90)/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fcard%2Fimage%2F316335%2F2016_2F07_2F21_2F86_2FPokemon_Go.f94c9.jpg","feature_image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/1ZbWRXyzHcxIDPv6sWY10CCedp0=/1438x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30721%2F2016_2F07_2F21_2F86_2FPokemon_Go.f94c9.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/2KyLvCGkP_TyBIc3xtPy0rGBH6A=/356x205/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30721%2F2016_2F07_2F21_2F86_2FPokemon_Go.f94c9.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/Pi4VAj9rRt3r4gb5q8pZXwDhDig=/712x410/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30721%2F2016_2F07_2F21_2F86_2FPokemon_Go.f94c9.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/GMwCzYJE_ZH45EVoqc8EVKOtTOM=/280x157/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30721%2F2016_2F07_2F21_2F86_2FPokemon_Go.f94c9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/bEwGy-3DC1CIL-AMn3p93dkLnZU=/560x314/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F30721%2F2016_2F07_2F21_2F86_2FPokemon_Go.f94c9.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/2hpGYRv","display_title":"'Pokémon Go' is officially launching in India tomorrow","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"weed_in_america":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"ooyala":[{"data-slug":"A6nG2zy0Nv","data-source":"blueprint"}],"gallery":[]},"excerpt":"It's finally here!","show_sponsorship":null,"sponsorship_footer":null,"channel":"Tech","channel_label":"Tech","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/tech/","tweet_text":"'Pokémon Go' is officially launching in India tomorrow"},{"_id":"584c187528cc36412a00077b","id":"2016/12/10/pokemon-zoology-3d-drawings","title":"Charmander and friends come to life in artist's Pokémon renderings","title_tag":null,"author":"Sophie Hirsh","post_date":"2016-12-10T15:00:00+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 15:00:00 +0000","formatted_date":"12/10/2016","formatted_shares":"6.9k","sort_key":"1CfK4o","link":"http://mashable.com/2016/12/10/pokemon-zoology-3d-drawings/","content":{"plain":"Gotta 3D design 'em all.\nJoshua Dunlop, a freelance concept artist based in London, has created incredibly lifelike images of three classic Pokémon.\nCalled Pokemon Zoology, Dunlop's creatures appear to look 3D. The renderings basically show what it would be like if Pokémon Go came to life.\nSEE ALSO: New Pokemon are coming to 'Pokémon Go'\n\nThere were a lot of steps involved in creating the images.\n\"I originally sketched out some rough ideas in Photoshop, using real life animals as reference. Once I was happy, I used a 3D program called 3D-Coat to build and texture the model,\" Dunlop said in an email to Mashable.\n\"I then brought the model into a rendering program called KeyShot which allowed me to get realistic lighting and effects,\" he said. \"Finally I brought everything into Photoshop and built the images using a combination of photo-manipulation and digital painting. It takes a while but it's a lot of fun when you see the finished product.\"\n\nDunlop is a longtime fan of Pokémon, but he was only inspired to create the images recently. \n\"I've always had a soft spot for Pokémon, ever since I first got Pokémon Red for Gameboy. I loved the adventure and fantasy that came with the games,\" he said. \"I always wondered what they might look like if they were real. After watching Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and seeing the fantastic creatures they had brought to life, I was inspired to try and do just that.\"\nDunlop plans to continue with his project by digging even deeper and creating more 3D Pokémon images.\n\"I'm actually looking into possibly making a fan website focusing on Pokémon Zoology. Looking at their diets, habitats, breeding and training, accompanied by my 3D and Digital Artwork,\" Dunlop said. \"I think it would be a great project and would be happy to work with anyone willing to help (starting with a web designer).\"\n\nDunlop is raising money to create his Pokémon Zoology website.
