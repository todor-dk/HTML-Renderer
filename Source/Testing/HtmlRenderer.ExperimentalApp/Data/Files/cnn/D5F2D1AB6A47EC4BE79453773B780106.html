<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

      <div class="description padded"><p>The <b>Cable News Network</b> (<b>CNN</b>) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner. It was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel; however, by April 2016, a CNN executive officially described the channel as "no longer a TV news network" and instead as "a 24-hour global multiplatform network." Upon its launch, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage, and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.</p>
<p>While the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from the Time Warner Center in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as <b>CNN/U.S.</b> (or <b>CNN Domestic</b>) to distinguish the American channel from its international sister network, CNN International. As of August 2010, CNN is available in over 100 million U.S. households. Broadcast coverage of the U.S. channel extends to over 890,000 American hotel rooms, as well as carriage on cable and satellite providers throughout Canada. Globally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.</p>
<p>As of February 2015, CNN is available to approximately 96,289,000 cable, satellite, and telco television households (82.7% of households with at least one television set) in the United States.</p></div>

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","item_count":13501,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":25,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingbytes","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"tech","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":612,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","name":"tech","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-11-28T16:29:17.653637","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/11\/28\/cnn-buys-video-sharing-social-media-app-beme-for","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1026951\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-11-28T17:21:18.989541","latitude":null,"id":1026951,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on nytimes.com","push_content":"CNN buys video-sharing social media app Beme for undisclosed amount - New York Times","longitude":null,"whoas":28,"type":"text","slug":"cnn-buys-video-sharing-social-media-app-beme-for","shortened_url":"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/2gP82wo","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/11\/28\/technology\/cnn-brings-in-the-social-app-beme-to-cultivate-a-millennial-audience.html?_r=2","url_external_text":"Read more on nytimes.com","importance":3,"url_domain":"nytimes.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":{"title":"Jennifer Epstein on Twitter","width":164,"height":431,"id":193417,"html":"","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps\/status\/800762199497121793","thumbnail_width":150,"url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Cxzg17WWEAEUqtT.jpg:large","author_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps","provider_name":"Twitter","type":"photo","provider_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com","oembed":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Cxzg17WWEAEUqtT.jpg:thumb","author_name":"jeneps"},"author":{"username":"rebecca.bratek","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","first_name":"Rebecca","id":29},"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/web\/status\/800762199497121793","date_ap":"Nov 21, 2016, 06:19 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/11\/21\/list-of-tv-executivess-and-anchors-who-have","content":"List of TV executives and anchors who have entered elevators at Trump Tower to go to an off-the-record meeting with Donald Trump, according to press pool - @jeneps","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/ERCg","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

There are additional major offices and production facilities elsewhere in New York City, as well as in Los Angeles and Burbank, California.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2007, when ABC Radio (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. The fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the Big Three television networks, ABC is often nicknamed as \"<b>The Alphabet Network<\/b>\", as its initialism also represents the first three letters of the English alphabet, in order.<\/p>\n<p>ABC originally launched on October 12, 1943, as a radio network, separated from and serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80% interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities\/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.<\/p>\n<p>The television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Most Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity to the Canada–United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider, although most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that allow pay television providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue. ABC News provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by Citadel Broadcasting, which purchased the ABC Radio properties in 2007.<\/p>","item_count":157,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":3696,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/5\/54\/ABC_77_W66_jeh.JPG\/512px-ABC_77_W66_jeh.JPG","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3696","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Broadcasting_Company","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"abc","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":400,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-15T18:20:31.536115","name":"ABC","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=352328","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/bill-shine\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-08-12T17:37:25.264686","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bdos","local_url":"\/topic\/bill-shine\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2016-08-12T17:37:24.728828","image_width":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/352328\/","description":"","item_count":2,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":352328,"image_url":"","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=352328","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bill_Shine","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"bill-shine","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":null,"latest_item_date":"2016-11-21T18:19:55.481023","name":"Bill Shine","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"TVChannel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=193","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cbs\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CBS\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:00:05.135180","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/DH","local_url":"\/topic\/cbs\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2011-06-10T20:23:06","image_width":329,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/193\/","description":"<p><b>CBS<\/b> (an initialism of the network's former name, the <b>Columbia Broadcasting System<\/b>) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation.

It has also been called the <b>\"Tiffany Network\"<\/b>, alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley. It can also refer to some of CBS's first demonstrations of color television, which were held in a former Tiffany &amp; Co. building in New York City in 1950.<\/p>\n<p>The network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc., a collection of 16 radio stations that was purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System. Under Paley's guidance, CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States, and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks. In 1974, CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS, Inc. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting, Inc. in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation. In 2000, CBS came under the control of Viacom, which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies, and re-established CBS Corporation – through the spin-off of its broadcast television, radio and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets – with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation is controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controls the current Viacom.<\/p>\n<p>CBS continues to operate the CBS Radio network, which now mainly provides news and features content for its portfolio of owned-and-operated radio stations in large and mid-sized markets, and affiliated radio stations in various other markets.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

Following the acquisition by GE (which later liquidated RCA), Bob Wright served as chief executive officer of NBC, remaining in that position until his retirement in 2007, when he was succeeded by Jeff Zucker. In 2003, French media company Vivendi merged its entertainment assets with GE, forming NBC Universal. Comcast purchased a controlling interest in the company in 2011, and acquired General Electric's remaining stake in 2013.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-11-21T18:19:55.481023","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/11\/21\/list-of-tv-executivess-and-anchors-who-have","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1018816\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-11-21T18:39:09.479853","latitude":null,"id":1018816,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","push_content":"List of TV executivess and anchors who have entered elevators at Trump Tower to go to an off-the-record meeting with Donald Trump, according to press pool - @jeneps","longitude":null,"whoas":95,"type":"text","slug":"list-of-tv-executivess-and-anchors-who-have","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2fLiDai","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":{"name":"Jennifer Epstein","screen_name":"jeneps","tweet_id":"800762199497121793","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566241898352766976\/9bw5CT8u_normal.png","user_id":"45399148","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps\/status\/800762199497121793","content":"Here are the TV execs and anchors who have entered the elevators at Trump Tower to go to an off-the-record meeting… https:\/\/t.co\/n17sgtoGCY","location":"New York","id":717203,"date":"2016-11-21T18:06:00"},"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/web\/status\/800762199497121793","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","importance":1,"url_domain":"twitter.com","pushed":false},{"sponsor":null,"media":{"title":"Jeff Zucker, Wolf Blitzer and Deborah Turness are among the early arrivals for TV nets' meeting with Trump https:\/\/t.co\/IBIFqQ4lys","width":2048,"height":1536,"id":193407,"html":"","thumbnail_height":150,"original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps\/status\/800753423771500544\/photo\/1","thumbnail_width":150,"url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CxzY3-FWQAAJmRH.jpg","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps","provider_name":"Twitter","type":"photo","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","oembed":{"twittervideo":null,"instagramvideo":null,"instagramphoto":null,"twitterphoto":{"medium_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CxzY3-FWQAAJmRH.jpg:medium","upload_small":null,"medium_width":1200,"large_width":2048,"upload_thumbnail":null,"medium_height":900,"upload":null,"small_width":680,"small_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CxzY3-FWQAAJmRH.jpg:small","small_height":510,"large_height":1536,"type":"twitterphoto","upload_large":null,"upload_medium":null,"id":58730,"large_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CxzY3-FWQAAJmRH.jpg:large"},"type":"twitterphoto","id":58730},"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CxzY3-FWQAAJmRH.jpg:thumb","author_name":"Jennifer Epstein"},"author":{"username":"rebecca.bratek","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","first_name":"Rebecca","id":29},"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps\/status\/800753423771500544\/photo\/1","date_ap":"Nov 21, 2016, 05:38 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/11\/21\/photo-jeff-zucker-wolf-blitzer-and-deborah","content":"Photo: Jeff Zucker, Wolf Blitzer and Deborah Turness are among the early arrivals for TV networks' meeting with Donald Trump - @jeneps","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/ERB1","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":8,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=366239","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/trump-appointments-and-nominations\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":9,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cabinet_of_Donald_Trump\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-23T20:01:58.643390","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BhRF","local_url":"\/topic\/trump-appointments-and-nominations\/","daily_count":1,"created_on":"2016-11-14T17:54:47.236429","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/366239\/","description":"<p>The <b>cabinet of Donald Trump<\/b> will replace Barack Obama's cabinet when each nominee is confirmed by the United States Senate and administered the oath of office, on or after January 20, 2017.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=18826","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/jeff-zucker\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeff_Zucker\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:10:07.569579","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/E3o","local_url":"\/topic\/jeff-zucker\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2010-09-24T15:14:17","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/18826\/","description":"<p><b>Jeffrey Adam \"Jeff\" Zucker<\/b> (born April 9, 1965) is the current president of CNN Worldwide.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-11-21T17:38:21.577728","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/11\/21\/photo-jeff-zucker-wolf-blitzer-and-deborah","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1018775\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-11-21T17:38:22.576983","latitude":null,"id":1018775,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","push_content":"Photo: Jeff Zucker, Wolf Blitzer and Deborah Turness are among the early arrivals for TV networks' meeting with Donald Trump - @jeneps","longitude":null,"whoas":57,"type":"text","slug":"photo-jeff-zucker-wolf-blitzer-and-deborah","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2g9URlm","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":{"name":"Jennifer Epstein","screen_name":"jeneps","tweet_id":"800753423771500544","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/566241898352766976\/9bw5CT8u_normal.png","user_id":"45399148","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps\/status\/800753423771500544","content":"Jeff Zucker, Wolf Blitzer and Deborah Turness are among the early arrivals for TV nets' meeting with Trump https:\/\/t.co\/IBIFqQ4lys","location":"New York","id":717178,"date":"2016-11-21T17:31:08"},"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jeneps\/status\/800753423771500544\/photo\/1","url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","importance":1,"url_domain":"twitter.com","pushed":false},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"tricia.mcdermott","last_name":"McDermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott","first_name":"Tricia","id":23},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/21\/media\/donald-trump-meeting-tv-networks\/index.html","date_ap":"Nov 21, 2016, 04:44 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/11\/21\/representatives-from-5-largest-us-tv-networks-to","content":"Representatives from 5 largest US TV networks to attend off-the-record meeting with Donald Trump Monday afternoon, aide says - CNN","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/ERAx","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","item_count":28200,"kind":"location","latitude":37.167931,"id":10,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","longitude":-95.845016,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"united-states","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":269,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","name":"United States","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"TVChannel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=3696","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/abc\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_Broadcasting_Company\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:43:17.825899","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/7m","local_url":"\/topic\/abc\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2011-04-14T21:09:28","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3696\/","description":"<p>The <b>American Broadcasting Company<\/b> (<b>ABC<\/b>) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is owned by the Disney–ABC Television Group, a subsidiary of the Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company.

In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80% interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities\/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.<\/p>\n<p>The television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Most Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity to the Canada–United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider, although most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that allow pay television providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","item_count":3456,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":109,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"television","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":384,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","name":"television","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":83,"ping_category":[],"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","daily_count":8,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","description":"<p><b>Entertainment<\/b> is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-11-21T16:44:16.965464","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/11\/21\/representatives-from-5-largest-us-tv-networks-to","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1018709\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-11-21T16:44:18.986780","latitude":null,"id":1018709,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on money.cnn.com","push_content":"Representatives from 5 largest US TV networks to attend off-the-record meeting with Donald Trump Monday afternoon, aide says - CNN","longitude":null,"whoas":160,"type":"text","slug":"representatives-from-5-largest-us-tv-networks-to","shortened_url":"http:\/\/cnnmon.ie\/2gdxedB","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/21\/media\/donald-trump-meeting-tv-networks\/index.html","url_external_text":"Read more on money.cnn.com","importance":4,"url_domain":"money.cnn.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"stephanie.clary","last_name":"Clary","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","is_staff":true,"full_name":"Stephanie Clary","first_name":"Stephanie","id":8},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/11\/media\/corey-lewandowski-resigns-cnn\/index.html","date_ap":"Nov 11, 2016, 10:44 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/11\/11\/former-donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey","content":"Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski resigns from CNN, spokeswoman confirms - CNN Money","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EOPe","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, modernists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern States for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 to 1865, when he was assassinated, and the most recent being George W. Bush, who served from 2001 to 2009. The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-11-11T22:44:28.579692","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/11\/11\/former-donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1008088\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-11-11T22:44:29.102283","latitude":null,"id":1008088,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on money.cnn.com","push_content":"Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski resigns from CNN, spokeswoman confirms - CNN Money","longitude":null,"whoas":113,"type":"text","slug":"former-donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey","shortened_url":"http:\/\/cnnmon.ie\/2fYfPsh","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/11\/11\/media\/corey-lewandowski-resigns-cnn\/index.html","url_external_text":"Read more on money.cnn.com","importance":2,"url_domain":"money.cnn.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"stephanie.clary","last_name":"Clary","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","is_staff":true,"full_name":"Stephanie Clary","first_name":"Stephanie","id":8},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/11\/07\/at-rally-in-scranton-pa-donald-trump-criticizes","date_ap":"Nov 07, 2016, 11:28 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/11\/07\/at-rally-in-scranton-pa-donald-trump-criticizes","content":"At rally in Scranton, Pa., Donald Trump criticizes media, crowd chants 'CNN sucks'","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EMkd","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution.

The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-11-07T23:28:24.185462","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/11\/07\/at-rally-in-scranton-pa-donald-trump-criticizes","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1001701\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-11-08T05:31:29.223789","latitude":null,"id":1001701,"ping":null,"url_text":"End of alert","push_content":"At rally in Scranton, Pa., Donald Trump criticizes media, crowd chants 'CNN sucks'","longitude":null,"whoas":123,"type":"text","slug":"at-rally-in-scranton-pa-donald-trump-criticizes","shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EMkd","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"","url_external_text":"End of alert","importance":2,"url_domain":"breakingnews.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"tricia.mcdermott","last_name":"McDermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Tricia McDermott","first_name":"Tricia","id":23},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/10\/cnn-severs-ties-with-donna-brazile-230534","date_ap":"Oct 31, 2016, 04:40 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/31\/cnn-network-never-gave-donna-brazile-access-to","content":"CNN: Network never gave Donna Brazile access to debate questions, is 'completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign'","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EKXk","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active party.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrats' dominant worldview was once classical liberalism, while, especially in the rural South, populism was its leading characteristic. In the 1890s, under the influence of its three-time defeated presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and the Populist Party, the party moved to the left from an economic point of view and, since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, it has promoted a social-liberal platform, supporting social justice.<\/p>\n<p>Well into the 20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s the business wing withered outside the South. After the racial turmoil of the 1960s most southern whites and many northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after 1970. White evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican at the state and local level in the 1990s. However, African Americans became a major Democratic element after 1964. After 2000, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Asian Americans, the LGBT community, single women and professional women moved toward the party as well. The Northeast and West Coast became Democratic strongholds by 1990 after the Republicans stopped appealing to socially liberal voters there. Overall the Democratic Party has retained a membership lead over its major rival the Republican Party (GOP).<\/p>\n<p>Today, the House Democratic caucus is composed mostly of progressives and centrists, with a smaller minority of conservative Democrats.<\/p>\n<p>The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy. The party has united with smaller left-wing regional parties throughout the country such as Farmer–Labor Party in Minnesota and the Nonpartisan League in North Dakota.<\/p>\n<p>Fourteen Democrats have served as president, under fifteen administrations: the first was Andrew Jackson, who served from 1829 to 1837; Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897, and is thus counted as the 22nd and 24th President. The most recent is the incumbent, President Barack Obama, who has been in office since 2009 and whose term expires in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th Congress, following the 2014 elections, Democrats hold a minority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The party also holds 18 governorships and control of a minority of state legislatures, as well as the mayoralty of Washington, D.C.<\/p>","item_count":3622,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":114,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/45\/U.S._Democratic_Party_logo_%28transparent%29.svg\/512px-U.S._Democratic_Party_logo_%28transparent%29.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=114","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"democratic-party","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":512,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T23:01:05.132349","name":"Democratic Party (United States)","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=324932","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donna-brazile\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donna_Brazile\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:54:23.793159","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BWg0","local_url":"\/topic\/donna-brazile\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2016-03-09T03:40:07.075182","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/324932\/","description":"<p><b>Donna Lease Brazile<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'z' in 'Zion'\">z<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; born December 15, 1959) is an American author and political analyst.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-10-31T16:40:25.917167","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/31\/cnn-network-never-gave-donna-brazile-access-to","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/993214\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-10-31T16:40:26.952255","latitude":null,"id":993214,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on politico.com","push_content":"CNN: Network never gave Donna Brazile access to debate questions, is 'completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign'","longitude":null,"whoas":118,"type":"text","slug":"cnn-network-never-gave-donna-brazile-access-to","shortened_url":"http:\/\/politi.co\/2f5aICY","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/10\/cnn-severs-ties-with-donna-brazile-230534","url_external_text":"Read more on politico.com","importance":3,"url_domain":"politico.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"rebecca.bratek","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","first_name":"Rebecca","id":29},"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/donnabrazile\/status\/793119360646643713","date_ap":"Oct 31, 2016, 04:08 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/31\/donna-brazile-writes-on-twitter-thank-you-cnn","content":"Donna Brazile writes on Twitter: 'Thank you CNN.

Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active party.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrats' dominant worldview was once classical liberalism, while, especially in the rural South, populism was its leading characteristic. In the 1890s, under the influence of its three-time defeated presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and the Populist Party, the party moved to the left from an economic point of view and, since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, it has promoted a social-liberal platform, supporting social justice.<\/p>\n<p>Well into the 20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s the business wing withered outside the South. After the racial turmoil of the 1960s most southern whites and many northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after 1970. White evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican at the state and local level in the 1990s. However, African Americans became a major Democratic element after 1964. After 2000, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Asian Americans, the LGBT community, single women and professional women moved toward the party as well. The Northeast and West Coast became Democratic strongholds by 1990 after the Republicans stopped appealing to socially liberal voters there. Overall the Democratic Party has retained a membership lead over its major rival the Republican Party (GOP).<\/p>\n<p>Today, the House Democratic caucus is composed mostly of progressives and centrists, with a smaller minority of conservative Democrats.<\/p>\n<p>The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy. The party has united with smaller left-wing regional parties throughout the country such as Farmer–Labor Party in Minnesota and the Nonpartisan League in North Dakota.<\/p>\n<p>Fourteen Democrats have served as president, under fifteen administrations: the first was Andrew Jackson, who served from 1829 to 1837; Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897, and is thus counted as the 22nd and 24th President. The most recent is the incumbent, President Barack Obama, who has been in office since 2009 and whose term expires in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th Congress, following the 2014 elections, Democrats hold a minority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The party also holds 18 governorships and control of a minority of state legislatures, as well as the mayoralty of Washington, D.C.<\/p>","item_count":3622,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":114,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/45\/U.S._Democratic_Party_logo_%28transparent%29.svg\/512px-U.S._Democratic_Party_logo_%28transparent%29.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=114","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"democratic-party","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":512,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T23:01:05.132349","name":"Democratic Party (United States)","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Person","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=324932","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/donna-brazile\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donna_Brazile\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:54:23.793159","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BWg0","local_url":"\/topic\/donna-brazile\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2016-03-09T03:40:07.075182","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/324932\/","description":"<p><b>Donna Lease Brazile<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'z' in 'Zion'\">z<\/span><span title=\"\/ɪ\/ short 'i' in 'bid'\">ɪ<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; born December 15, 1959) is an American author and political analyst.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-10-31T16:08:39.582594","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/31\/donna-brazile-writes-on-twitter-thank-you-cnn","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/993181\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-10-31T16:08:40.051065","latitude":null,"id":993181,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","push_content":"Donna Brazile writes on Twitter: 'Thank you CNN.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-10-31T16:02:27.494395","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/31\/cnn-says-network-has-accepted-donna-braziles","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/993169\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-10-31T16:56:51.299092","latitude":null,"id":993169,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","push_content":"CNN says network has accepted Donna Brazile's resignation as contributor after leaked email appears to show she sent Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta a debate question","longitude":null,"whoas":140,"type":"text","slug":"cnn-says-network-has-accepted-donna-braziles","shortened_url":"http:\/\/politi.co\/2f5aICY","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":{"name":"Michael Calderone","screen_name":"mlcalderone","tweet_id":"793116899437518848","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/707744338172907520\/sOBnnXo8_normal.jpg","user_id":"63004503","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mlcalderone\/status\/793116899437518848","content":"CNN says its “completely uncomfortable” w\/ Donna Brazile’s interactions with Clinton campaign after email suggests… https:\/\/t.co\/PgDEiCREJr","location":"Brooklyn, NY","id":697512,"date":"2016-10-31T15:46:18"},"url":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/10\/cnn-severs-ties-with-donna-brazile-230534","url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","importance":3,"url_domain":"politico.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"rebecca.bratek","last_name":"Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","first_name":"Rebecca","id":29},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/23\/more-trump-adviser-says-att-time-warner-deal","date_ap":"Oct 23, 2016, 08:00 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/23\/more-trump-adviser-says-att-time-warner-deal","content":"More: Trump adviser says AT&T-Time Warner deal would concentrate too much media power in the hands of 'the few,' also cites concern about Time Warner unit CNN, says its views are 'anti-Trump' - Reuters","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EIG4","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, modernists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern States for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 to 1865, when he was assassinated, and the most recent being George W. Bush, who served from 2001 to 2009. The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation. Once dominant in the Northeast and Midwest, the party's core support now comes from the South as well as conservative Catholics and evangelicals in the South and across the country.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th United States Congress, Republicans have their largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1928 election and a majority of seats in the Senate. The party also holds a majority of governorships and state legislatures. Specifically, 68 out of 98 partisan state legislative chambers have Republican majorities.<\/p>\n<p>According to CBS news, \"The Republican National Committee says the acronym \"GOP\" dates back to 1875, at which time it meant 'Gallant Old Party'.\"<\/p>","item_count":6723,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":118,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/44\/Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg\/512px-Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=118","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Republican_Party_(United_States)","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"republican-party","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":672,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T20:19:05.117092","name":"Republican Party (United States)","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=86519","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/telephones\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Telecommunication\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T16:35:13.710384","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Wfd","local_url":"\/topic\/telephones\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2014-10-13T16:20:23.890060","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/86519\/","description":"<p><b>Telecommunication<\/b> is the transmission of signs, signals, messages, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems.

Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. The term is often used in its plural form, <b>telecommunications<\/b>, because it involves many different technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.<\/p>\n<p>A revolution in wireless communication began in the first decade of the 20th century with the pioneering developments in radio communications by Guglielmo Marconi, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","item_count":13501,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":25,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingbytes","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"tech","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":612,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","name":"tech","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-10-23T20:00:58.082415","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/23\/more-trump-adviser-says-att-time-warner-deal","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/984492\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-10-23T20:00:59.389001","latitude":null,"id":984492,"ping":null,"url_text":"End of alert","push_content":"More: Trump adviser says AT&T-Time Warner deal would concentrate too much media power in the hands of 'the few,' also cites concern about Time Warner unit CNN, says its views are 'anti-Trump' - Reuters","longitude":null,"whoas":66,"type":"text","slug":"more-trump-adviser-says-att-time-warner-deal","shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EIG4","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"","url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","importance":3,"url_domain":"breakingnews.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"jillian.stampher","last_name":"Stampher","email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","id":14},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/thehill.com\/media\/301385-cnn-lands-melania-trump-interview","date_ap":"Oct 17, 2016, 07:08 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/17\/just-in-anderson-cooper-lands-melania-trump","content":"Melania Trump to be interviewed by CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night - The Hill","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EGlm","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, modernists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern States for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 to 1865, when he was assassinated, and the most recent being George W.

The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation. Once dominant in the Northeast and Midwest, the party's core support now comes from the South as well as conservative Catholics and evangelicals in the South and across the country.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th United States Congress, Republicans have their largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1928 election and a majority of seats in the Senate.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active party.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrats' dominant worldview was once classical liberalism, while, especially in the rural South, populism was its leading characteristic. In the 1890s, under the influence of its three-time defeated presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and the Populist Party, the party moved to the left from an economic point of view and, since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, it has promoted a social-liberal platform, supporting social justice.<\/p>\n<p>Well into the 20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s the business wing withered outside the South. After the racial turmoil of the 1960s most southern whites and many northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after 1970. White evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican at the state and local level in the 1990s. However, African Americans became a major Democratic element after 1964. After 2000, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Asian Americans, the LGBT community, single women and professional women moved toward the party as well. The Northeast and West Coast became Democratic strongholds by 1990 after the Republicans stopped appealing to socially liberal voters there. Overall the Democratic Party has retained a membership lead over its major rival the Republican Party (GOP).<\/p>\n<p>Today, the House Democratic caucus is composed mostly of progressives and centrists, with a smaller minority of conservative Democrats.<\/p>\n<p>The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy.

The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.<\/p>\n<p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts. Facebook deems users from the ages of 13 to 18 as being a minor and therefore, sets their profiles to share its content with friends only.<\/p>","item_count":1269,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":1066,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/b\/bf\/Facebook_user_page_%282014%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1066","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"facebook","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":219,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T15:38:44.996829","name":"Facebook","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Company","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=360504","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tv-one\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TV_One_(U.S._TV_network)\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-12T06:00:54.373761","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bfwk","local_url":"\/topic\/tv-one\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2016-10-12T20:02:30.056236","image_width":486,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/360504\/","description":"<p><b>TV One<\/b> is an American digital cable and satellite television network that is owned by Radio One, having acquired Comcast's stake in the TV network in 2015.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

He became well known in 2011 by posting old video clips of politicians, often of them making statements contrary to their current political positions, to YouTube. He was described as \"the [2012] Republican primaries' most influential amateur opposition researcher\". He was hired by BuzzFeed in December 2011. He attended college at Ohio University, but got involved with political reporting and left school without a degree. As of 2012, he was enrolled at St. Johns University to study early American history and did online courses to meet his degree requirement.<\/p>\n<p>At 19, Kaczynski had a bout of pancreatitis leading him to eschew smoking and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Slate political reporter Dave Weigel called him \"the Oppenheimer of archival video research.\"<\/p>\n<p>Kaczynski got his start by emailing reporters' tip boxes with clips he found of politicians contradicting themselves. In 2012, Kaczynski uncovered numerous clips of Mitt Romney supporting an individual mandate, contradicting his then-current campaign position. He also uncovered a clip of Barack Obama protesting at Harvard while at law school over a lack of faculty diversity.<\/p>\n<p><i>Time<\/i> named Kaczynski's Twitter feed one of \"The 140 Best Twitter Feeds of 2013\", one of ten in the Politics category. He has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, CNN, NPR, PBS, and C-SPAN. He was described as a moderate Republican in a New York Magazine profile. It was later revealed Kaczynski was misquoted and called himself \"a political moderate.\" Kaczynski did not graduate from college. He has worked as an intern for the Republican National Committee and was an intern in 2011 in the office of Congressman Bob Turner. In 2013 he was listed on the Daily Beast website's \"Beast Best\" awards for his Twitter Feed. In 2014, New York Magazine named him the 13th most influential Tweeter in New York City.<\/p>\n<p>In November 2013, Kaczynski reported that Kentucky Senator Rand Paul had plagiarized sections of s speech he gave in June 2013 on immigration from the Wikipedia article of the movie Stand and Deliver. Kaczynski subsequently reported Paul's 2012 book <i>Government Bullies<\/i> also contained passages that were plagiarized from articles from the right wing think tank Heritage Foundation and from the libertarian Cato Institute. Further reports by Kaczynski revealed another four instances of plagiarism from an article by Case Western Reserve University professor Jonathan H. Adler and Pacific Legal Foundation attorney Timothy Sandefur. Another section of the book was discovered to be plagiarized from an article written in Forbes Magazine.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, Kaczynski continued with a series of articles chronicling politicians' plagiarism. Kaczynski found more than a dozen examples of politicians running for office in 2014 copying their plans and issues pages verbatim from other candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013, he played a role in accidentally spreading misinformation about the identities of the suspected bombers when he retweeted false reports made by Reddit user Greg Hughes about a particular person who was innocent of the crime.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Politico reported  Kaczynski was leading internal opposition research at BuzzFeed looking to dig up dirt on politicians. NPR reported Kaczynski's team dug up clips of Donald Trump saying he supported – despite statements to the contrary – the Iraq War, a clip of Hillary Clinton referring to some children as \"super predators\", a video of Ben Carson saying he believed the pyramids were used to store grain and a video of Bernie Sanders proclaiming his support for Fidel Castro and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.<\/p>\n<p>Kaczynski subsequently found clips of Donald Trump supporting the 2011 American intervention in Libya, the toppling of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak, and pushing for U.S. action to protect Iranian protesters.<\/p>\n<p>Clips Kaczynski found of Donald Trump on the Howard Stern Show were used in both Democratic and Republican attack ads against Trump and as the basis of a question in the first general election Presidential debate of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>During the campaign for US President in 2016, Kaczynski brought to attention a statement by the chairman of the American Nazi Party that he supports Republican candidate Donald Trump on the grounds that \"if Trump does win ... it's going to be a real opportunity for people like white nationalists.\"<\/p>\n<p>On October 3, 2016 Kaczynski announced he was leaving BuzzFeed and joining CNN.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-10-03T17:40:21.422854","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/03\/buzzfeeds-andrew-kaczynski-and-his-political","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/966284\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-10-03T17:40:22.042394","latitude":null,"id":966284,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on huffingtonpost.com","push_content":"BuzzFeed's Andrew Kaczynski and his political research team are joining CNN -

Protests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to directly enact desired changes themselves. Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.<\/p>\n<p>Various forms of self-expression and protest are sometimes restricted by governmental policy (such as the requirement of protest permits), economic circumstances, religious orthodoxy, social structures, or media monopoly. One state reaction to protests is the use of riot police. Observers have noted an increased militarization of protest policing, with police deploying armored vehicles and snipers against the protesters.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","item_count":3456,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":109,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Cptvdisplay.jpg\/512px-Cptvdisplay.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=109","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Television","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"television","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":384,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T02:11:36.870244","name":"television","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":83,"ping_category":[],"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_last":83,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.385733","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BN","local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","daily_count":8,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","description":"<p><b>Entertainment<\/b> is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","item_count":13941,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":75,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg\/512px-Match_on_TV.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"entertainment","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":592,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:10:28.515343","name":"entertainment","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":2,"ping_category":[],"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_last":2,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","daily_count":27,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-09-16T00:06:47.793607","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/donald-trump-on-presidential-debates-i-dont","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/950580\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-09-16T00:06:48.451050","latitude":null,"id":950580,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on washingtonpost.com","push_content":"Donald Trump on presidential debates: 'I don't think Anderson Cooper should be a moderator because Anderson Cooper works for CNN...

Tracing its heritage back to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republican Party, the modern-day Democratic Party was founded around 1828 by Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active party.<\/p>\n<p>The Democrats' dominant worldview was once classical liberalism, while, especially in the rural South, populism was its leading characteristic. In the 1890s, under the influence of its three-time defeated presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan and the Populist Party, the party moved to the left from an economic point of view and, since Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal coalition in the 1930s, it has promoted a social-liberal platform, supporting social justice.<\/p>\n<p>Well into the 20th century, the party had conservative pro-business and southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s the business wing withered outside the South. After the racial turmoil of the 1960s most southern whites and many northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after 1970. White evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican at the state and local level in the 1990s. However, African Americans became a major Democratic element after 1964. After 2000, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Asian Americans, the LGBT community, single women and professional women moved toward the party as well. The Northeast and West Coast became Democratic strongholds by 1990 after the Republicans stopped appealing to socially liberal voters there. Overall the Democratic Party has retained a membership lead over its major rival the Republican Party (GOP).<\/p>\n<p>Today, the House Democratic caucus is composed mostly of progressives and centrists, with a smaller minority of conservative Democrats.<\/p>\n<p>The party's philosophy of modern liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It seeks to provide government intervention and regulation in the economy. These interventions, such as the introduction of social programs, support for labor unions, affordable college tuitions, moves toward universal health care and equal opportunity, consumer protection, and environmental protection form the core of the party's economic policy. The party has united with smaller left-wing regional parties throughout the country such as Farmer–Labor Party in Minnesota and the Nonpartisan League in North Dakota.<\/p>\n<p>Fourteen Democrats have served as president, under fifteen administrations: the first was Andrew Jackson, who served from 1829 to 1837; Grover Cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms from 1885 to 1889 and 1893 to 1897, and is thus counted as the 22nd and 24th President. The most recent is the incumbent, President Barack Obama, who has been in office since 2009 and whose term expires in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th Congress, following the 2014 elections, Democrats hold a minority of seats in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The party also holds 18 governorships and control of a minority of state legislatures, as well as the mayoralty of Washington, D.C.<\/p>","item_count":3622,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":114,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/45\/U.S._Democratic_Party_logo_%28transparent%29.svg\/512px-U.S._Democratic_Party_logo_%28transparent%29.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=114","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_Party_(United_States)","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"democratic-party","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":512,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T23:01:05.132349","name":"Democratic Party (United States)","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first woman partner at Rose Law Firm the following year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public schools, and served on several corporate boards.<\/p>\n<p>As First Lady of the United States, Clinton led the unsuccessful effort to enact the Clinton health care plan of 1993. In 1997 and 1999, she helped create the State Children's Health Insurance Program. She also tackled the problems of adoption and family safety and foster care. At the 1995 UN conference on women (held in Beijing), Clinton stated in a then controversial and influential speech, that \"human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights\". Her marriage survived the Lewinsky scandal, and her role as first lady drew a polarized response from the public. Clinton was elected in 2000 as the first female senator from New York, the only first lady ever to seek elective office. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, she voted to approve the war in Afghanistan. She also voted for the Iraq Resolution (a vote she later said she regretted). She took a leading role in investigating the health issues faced by 9\/11 first responders. She further voted against the Bush tax cuts, and against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.<\/p>\n<p>As Secretary of State in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013, Clinton responded to the Arab Spring, during which she advocated the U.S. military intervention in Libya. She helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against Iran, in an effort to force curtailment of that country's nuclear program; this would eventually lead to the multinational Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action agreement in 2015. Leaving office after Obama's first term, she wrote her fifth book and undertook speaking engagements.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. She received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016 Democratic primaries, and formally accepted her party's nomination for President of the United States on July 28, 2016, with vice presidential running mate Senator Tim Kaine. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. As part of her 2016 platform, she emphasized raising incomes, improvements to the Affordable Care Act and reform of campaign finance and Wall Street. She favored allowing pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, combating climate change, expanding and protecting LGBT and women's rights, and instituting family support through paid parental leave and universal preschool. However, a controversy relating to a privately hosted email server during her tenure as Secretary of State became a significant issue, including in the closing days of the campaign. On November 8, 2016, Clinton lost to Republican rival Donald Trump, failing to obtain the necessary 270 votes in the electoral college, despite receiving a plurality of the national popular vote. It was the fifth US presidential election where the candidate who received the most popular votes did not win the election.<\/p>","item_count":3543,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":247,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/27\/Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg\/512px-Hillary_Clinton_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait_crop.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=247","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hillary_Clinton","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"off","slug":"hillary-clinton","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":640,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-22T14:14:38.901234","name":"Hillary Clinton","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":2,"ping_category":[],"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_last":2,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","daily_count":27,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-09-13T00:08:48.584901","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/13\/hillary-clinton-in-interview-with-cnns-anderson","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/947842\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-09-13T00:13:34.335397","latitude":null,"id":947842,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on snappytv.com","push_content":"Hillary Clinton, in interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, says is feeling so much better, notes she 'should have gotten some rest sooner' ...

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-08-04T02:49:24.604767","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/08\/04\/cnn-to-host-green-party-presidential-nominee-jill","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/915283\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-08-04T02:49:25.126586","latitude":null,"id":915283,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on adweek.com","push_content":"CNN to host Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein, running mate Ajamu Baraka for town hall on Aug. 17 - TV Newser","longitude":null,"whoas":61,"type":"text","slug":"cnn-to-host-green-party-presidential-nominee-jill","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ajxQ0Q","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.adweek.com\/tvnewser\/cnn-will-host-green-party-ticket-for-live-town-hall\/301346","url_external_text":"Read more on adweek.com","importance":3,"url_domain":"adweek.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"jillian.stampher","last_name":"Stampher","email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","id":14},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/08\/jeff-zucker-praises-corey-lewandowski-slams-vice-and-buzzfeed-226574","date_ap":"Aug 02, 2016, 07:41 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/08\/02\/buzzfeed-editor-in-chief-ben-smith-responds-to-cnn","content":"Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith responds to CNN president Jeff Zucker's comment that Buzzfeed, Vice aren't 'legitimate news organizations,' saying 'I'm happy to put our tough, fair coverage up against CNN's decision to turn its platform over to Jeff's friend Donald Trump' - Politico","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dzv1","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Company","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4021","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/buzzfeed\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BuzzFeed\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:38:14.960878","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BC1","local_url":"\/topic\/buzzfeed\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2013-03-15T18:55:50","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4021\/","description":"<p><b>BuzzFeed<\/b> is an American private Internet media company based in New York City.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Company","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1066","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/facebook\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:57:09.061922","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/RM","local_url":"\/topic\/facebook\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2010-05-12T21:51:00","image_width":390,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1066\/","description":"<p><b>Facebook<\/b> is an American for-profit corporation and online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, California, United States.

Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion.

Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-08-02T19:41:57.222208","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/08\/02\/buzzfeed-editor-in-chief-ben-smith-responds-to-cnn","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/913995\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-08-02T23:16:50.184368","latitude":null,"id":913995,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on politico.com","push_content":"Buzzfeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith responds to CNN president Jeff Zucker's comment that Buzzfeed, Vice aren't 'legitimate news organizations,; saying 'I'm happy to put our tough, fair coverage up against CNN's decision to turn its platform over to Jeff's friend Donald Trump' - Politico","longitude":null,"whoas":44,"type":"text","slug":"buzzfeed-editor-in-chief-ben-smith-responds-to-cnn","shortened_url":"http:\/\/politi.co\/2ayUH5h","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/08\/jeff-zucker-praises-corey-lewandowski-slams-vice-and-buzzfeed-226574","url_external_text":"Read more on politico.com","importance":1,"url_domain":"politico.com","pushed":false},{"sponsor":null,"media":{"title":"CNN TÜRK - CNN TÜRK BİNASINA ASKER GELDİ | Facebook","width":560,"height":315,"id":165025,"html":"<div id=\"fb-root\"><\/div>\n<script>(function(d, s, id) {\n  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];\n  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;\n  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;\n  js.src = \"\/\/connect.facebook.net\/en_US\/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3\";\n  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);\n}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));<\/script><div class=\"fb-video\" data-href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/videos\/10157294590890106\/\"><blockquote cite=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/videos\/10157294590890106\/\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/videos\/10157294590890106\/\"><\/a><p>CNN TÜRK BİNASINA ASKER GELDİ<\/p>Posted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/\">CNN TÜRK<\/a> on Friday, July 15, 2016<\/blockquote><\/div>","thumbnail_height":160,"original_url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/videos\/10157294590890106\/","thumbnail_width":160,"url":null,"author_url":"http:\/\/facebook.com\/235465410105","provider_name":"Facebook","type":"video","provider_url":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com","oembed":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t15.0-10\/p160x160\/13722609_10157294591890106_494267289_n.jpg?oh=affb570fb80e42814d8fe22b47fcc4a9&oe=57F1AE54","author_name":"CNN TÜRK"},"author":{"username":"stephanie.clary","last_name":"Clary","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","is_staff":true,"full_name":"Stephanie Clary","first_name":"Stephanie","id":8},"url_external_link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/videos\/10157294590890106\/","date_ap":"Jul 16, 2016, 12:32 AM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/07\/16\/live-video-military-forces-enter-cnn-turks","content":"Live video: Military forces enter CNN Turk's building - CNN Turk on Facebook","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/DvLE","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=348732","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/military-action-in-turkey-2016\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-13T02:00:25.028879","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bcss","local_url":"\/topic\/military-action-in-turkey-2016\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2016-07-15T20:10:41.738678","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/348732\/","description":"<p>On 15 July 2016, a <i>coup d'état<\/i> was attempted in Turkey against state institutions, including, but not limited to the government and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The attempt was carried out by a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces that organized themselves as the Peace at Home Council. They attempted to seize control of several key places in Ankara, Istanbul, and elsewhere, but failed to do so after forces loyal to the state defeated them. The Council cited an alleged erosion of secularism, the elimination of democratic rule, a disregard for human rights, and Turkey's loss of credibility in the international arena as reasons for the coup. The government accused the coup leaders of being linked to the Gülen movement, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the Republic of Turkey and led by Fethullah Gülen, a Turkish businessman and cleric who lives in Pennsylvania, United States. Erdoğan accuses Gülen of being behind the coup—a claim that Gülen denies—and accused the United States of harboring him. Events surrounding the coup attempt and the purges in its aftermath reflect a complex power struggle between Islamist and ultranationalist elites in Turkey.<\/p>\n<p>During the coup, over 300 people were killed and more than 2,100 were injured. Many government buildings, including the Turkish Parliament and the Presidential Palace, were purposely damaged. Mass arrests followed, with at least 40,000 detained, including at least 10,000 soldiers and, for reasons that remain unclear, 2,745 judges. 15,000 education staff were also suspended and the licenses of 21,000 teachers working at private institutions were revoked as well after the government alleged they were loyal to Gülen. More than 100,000 people have been purged.<\/p>\n<p>Reactions to the event were largely against the coup attempt, both domestically and internationally. The main opposition parties in Turkey condemned the attempt, while several international leaders—such as those from the United States, NATO, the European Union, and other neighboring countries—called for \"respect of the democratic institutions in Turkey and its elected officials.\" International organizations expressed themselves against the coup as well. The United Nations Security Council, however, did not denounce the coup after disagreements over the phrasing of a statement.<\/p>\n<p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused the head of United States Central Command, chief General Joseph Votel of \"siding with coup plotters,\" (after Votel accused the Turkish government of arresting the Pentagon's contacts in Turkey).<\/p>","item_count":633,"kind":"arc","latitude":null,"id":348732,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/e5\/Turkey_adm_location_map.svg\/512px-Turkey_adm_location_map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=348732","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"military-action-in-turkey-2016","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":234,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T12:47:41.931580","name":"Turkey coup attempt, July 2016","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=467","woeid":23424969,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/turkey\/","recent_count":4,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:23:54.792028","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hh","local_url":"\/topic\/turkey\/","daily_count":16,"created_on":"2012-12-12T21:41:28","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/467\/","description":"<p><b>Turkey<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"\/ɜːr\/ 'ir' in 'bird'\">ɜːr<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Turkish: <span lang=\"tr\"><i>Türkiye<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈtyɾcije]<\/span>), officially the <b>Republic of Turkey<\/b> (Turkish: <span><span><span> <\/span><i>Türkiye Cumhuriyeti<\/i><\/span> <\/span>; <small>pronounced <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈtyɾcije d͡ʒumˈhuɾijeti]<\/span>), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly on the Anatolian peninsula in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location between Europe and Asia has retained its geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey has been inhabited since the Paleolithic by various ancient Anatolian civilisations, as well as Assyrians, Greeks, Thracians, Phrygians, Urartians and Armenians. After Alexander the Great's conquest, the area was Hellenized, a process which continued under the Roman Empire and its transition into the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century, starting the process of Turkification, which was accelerated by the Seljuk victory over the Byzantines at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish beyliks.<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-14th century the Ottomans started uniting Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, becoming a major power in Eurasia and Africa during the early modern period. The empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century, especially during the reign (1520–1566) of Suleiman the Magnificent. The empire remained powerful and influential for two more centuries, until important setbacks such as the Great Turkish War (1683–99) and the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) forced it to cede strategic territories in Europe, signalling the loss of its former military strength and wealth. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which aimed to modernise the Ottoman state, proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire.<\/p>\n<p>Suspended by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1878, the Ottoman constitution and parliament were restored with the Young Turk Revolution on 24 July 1908. Taking advantage of the chaos, Bulgaria formally declared its independence on 5 October 1908, and Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina on 6 October 1908. The Italo-Turkish War (1911–1912) encouraged the Balkan League to declare the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), which caused the Ottoman Empire to lose the majority of its remaining territories in Europe and triggered the largest ethnic cleansing of Turks in the Balkan peninsula since the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), resulting in the mass migrations of Turks to Anatolia. The disappointment in these losses led to the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état which effectively put the country under the control of the Three Pashas, who decided to join the Central Powers of World War I (1914–1918) which were ultimately defeated by the Allied Powers. During the war, the Ottoman government committed ethnic cleansing or genocide against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontic Greek citizens. Following the war, the conglomeration of territories and peoples that formerly comprised the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new states.<\/p>\n<p>The Turkish War of Independence (1919–1922), initiated by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and his colleagues in Anatolia against the occupying Allies, resulted in the abolition of monarchy in 1922 and the establishment of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923, with Atatürk as its first president.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey's official language is Turkish, a Turkic language spoken natively by 84.5% of the population. According to polls, between 78.1% and 81.3% of the country's citizens identify themselves as ethnic Turks. Other ethnic groups include legally recognised (Armenians, Greeks, Jews) and unrecognised (Kurds, Circassians, Arabs, Albanians, Bosniaks, Georgians, etc.) minorities. Kurds are the largest ethnic minority group, making up approximately 13.4% to 18% or up to 25% of the population, based on polls and estimates. The vast majority of the population is nominally Sunni Muslim, with Alevis making up the largest religious minority.<\/p>\n<p>Turkey is a charter member of the UN, an early member of NATO, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, applied for full EEC membership in 1987, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's growing economy and diplomatic initiatives have led to its recognition as a regional power.<\/p>","item_count":4770,"kind":"location","latitude":38.957741,"id":467,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b4\/Flag_of_Turkey.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Turkey.svg.png","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","longitude":35.431702,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=467","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turkey","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"turkey","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":341,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","name":"Turkey","geohash":"sycjwk0943wk","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"category":"TVChannel","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=993","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cnn\/","recent_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CNN\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:47:52.272548","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/QB","local_url":"\/topic\/cnn\/","daily_count":0,"created_on":"2010-09-08T15:33:04","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/993\/","description":"<p>The <b>Cable News Network<\/b> (<b>CNN<\/b>) is an American basic cable and satellite television channel that is owned by the Turner Broadcasting System division of Time Warner.

The Facebook website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.<\/p>\n<p>The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students; however, later they expanded it to higher education institutions in the Boston area, the Ivy League schools, and Stanford University. Facebook gradually added support for students at various other universities, and eventually to high school students as well. Since 2006, anyone age 13 and older has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook may be accessed by a large range of desktops, laptops, tablet computers, and smartphones over the Internet and mobile networks. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile indicating their name, occupation, schools attended and so on. Users can add other users as \"friends\", exchange messages, post status updates and digital photos, share digital videos and links, use various software applications (\"apps\"), and receive notifications when others update their profiles or make posts. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups organized by workplace, school, hobbies or other topics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". In groups, editors can pin posts to top. Additionally, users can complain about or block unpleasant people. Because of the large volume of data that users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for its privacy policies. Facebook makes most of its revenue from advertisements which appear onscreen.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering (IPO) in February 2012, and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Facebook has more than 1.65 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2016. As of April 2016, Facebook was the most popular social networking site in the world, based on the number of active user accounts. Facebook deems users from the ages of 13 to 18 as being a minor and therefore, sets their profiles to share its content with friends only.<\/p>","item_count":1269,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":1066,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/b\/bf\/Facebook_user_page_%282014%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1066","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"facebook","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":219,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-27T15:38:44.996829","name":"Facebook","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":81,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=8719","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/media\/","recent_count":2,"trend_rank_last":81,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mass_media\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:58:53.062721","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CQn","local_url":"\/topic\/media\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2012-05-01T16:06:44","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/8719\/","description":"<p>The <b>mass media<\/b> is a diversified collection of media technologies that reach a large audience via mass communication.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":17,"ping_category":[],"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","recent_count":8,"trend_rank_last":17,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:44.507639","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":34,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \"peace\". <b>Warfare<\/b> refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests which was greater than 41 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity for the next fifty years. War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians. For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians). Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers.<\/p>","item_count":46131,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":15,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6f\/Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg\/512px-Stele_of_Vultures_detail_01a.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"war-conflict","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":316,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:06:46.536464","name":"war & conflict","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-07-16T00:32:32.980440","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/07\/16\/live-video-military-forces-enter-cnn-turks","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/896338\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-07-16T00:32:33.608857","latitude":null,"id":896338,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on facebook.com","push_content":"Live Facebook video: Military forces enter CNN Turk's building","longitude":null,"whoas":53,"type":"text","slug":"live-video-military-forces-enter-cnn-turks","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/29Jw8H4","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cnnturk\/videos\/10157294590890106\/","url_external_text":"Read more on facebook.com","importance":2,"url_domain":"facebook.com","pushed":true},{"sponsor":null,"media":null,"author":{"username":"jillian.stampher","last_name":"Stampher","email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","is_staff":false,"full_name":"Jillian Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","id":14},"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/06\/corey-lewandowski-to-join-cnn-224733#ixzz4CQebKE00","date_ap":"Jun 23, 2016, 06:34 PM GMT","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/06\/23\/former-donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey","content":"Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reportedly joining CNN as political commentator, source tells Politico","data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/Dodk","topics":[{"trend_rank_current":6,"ping_category":[],"category":"PoliticsEvent","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1153","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":8,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_elections,_2016\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T12:00:49.834095","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Sl","local_url":"\/topic\/2016-us-elections\/","daily_count":2,"created_on":"2013-03-19T19:21:03","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1153\/","description":"<p>The <b>2016 United States elections<\/b> were held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.

In 1971, he took control of his family's real estate and construction firm, Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son, which was later renamed The Trump Organization. During his business career, Trump has built, renovated or managed numerous office towers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants from 1996 to 2015, and has lent the use of his name to brand various products. Trump has made cameo appearances in films and television series, and hosted and co-produced <i>The Apprentice<\/i>, a reality television series on NBC from 2004 to 2015. As of 2016, <i>Forbes<\/i> listed Trump as the 324th wealthiest person in the world (113th in the United States) with a net worth of $4.5 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Trump sought the Reform Party's presidential nomination in 2000, but withdrew before voting began. He considered running as a Republican for the 2012 election, but ultimately decided against it. In June 2015, he announced his candidacy for the 2016 election. He emerged as the front-runner in the Republican primaries among 17 contenders. His final Republican opponents suspended their campaigns in May 2016, and in July he was formally nominated at the Republican Convention. Trump's campaign received unprecedented media coverage and international attention. Many of his statements in interviews, on social media, and at campaign rallies were controversial or false. Numerous anti-Trump protests have occurred during his campaign and after the election.<\/p>\n<p>Trump won the <span>November 8<\/span> election by gaining a majority of the U.S. electoral college, although he received fewer popular votes nationwide than Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. At age 70, Trump will become the oldest and wealthiest person to assume the presidency in U.S. history, superseding Ronald Reagan and George Washington respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Trump's platform emphasizes renegotiating U.S.–China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a wall along the Mexico–U.S. border. His other positions include pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, reforming veterans' affairs, repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\"), abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes across the board, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies offshoring jobs. Trump advocates a non-interventionist approach to foreign policy, increased military spending, \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim immigrants to counteract Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against ISIL. He self-identifies as a conservative, and his ideology has been described by scholars and commentators as populist, protectionist and nationalist.<\/p>","item_count":4875,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":2731,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/d\/d2\/Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-Donald_Trump_August_19%2C_2015_%28cropped%29.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2731","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Donald_Trump","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"donald-trump","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":683,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","name":"Donald Trump","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":60,"ping_category":[],"category":"Subvertical","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=152","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","recent_count":1,"trend_rank_last":61,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Election\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T08:51:30.171575","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","local_url":"\/topic\/elections\/","daily_count":4,"created_on":"2010-05-06T06:20:51","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/152\/","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

The party is named after republicanism, the dominant value during the American Revolution. Founded by anti-slavery activists, modernists, ex-Whigs, and ex-Free Soilers in 1854, the Republicans dominated politics nationally and in the majority of northern States for most of the period between 1860 and 1932.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Republican presidents, the first being Abraham Lincoln, who served from 1861 to 1865, when he was assassinated, and the most recent being George W. Bush, who served from 2001 to 2009. The President-elect of the United States, businessman Donald Trump of New York, will become the 19th Republican president on January 20, 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The Republican Party's current ideology is American conservatism, which contrasts with the Democrats' modern liberalism. The Republican Party's platform involves support for free market capitalism, free enterprise, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, deregulation, and restrictions on labor unions. In addition to economic themes there are important social-conservative policies (particularly opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage), and traditional values, usually with a Judeo-Christian ethical foundation. Once dominant in the Northeast and Midwest, the party's core support now comes from the South as well as conservative Catholics and evangelicals in the South and across the country.<\/p>\n<p>In the 114th United States Congress, Republicans have their largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1928 election and a majority of seats in the Senate. The party also holds a majority of governorships and state legislatures. Specifically, 68 out of 98 partisan state legislative chambers have Republican majorities.<\/p>\n<p>According to CBS news, \"The Republican National Committee says the acronym \"GOP\" dates back to 1875, at which time it meant 'Gallant Old Party'.\"<\/p>","item_count":6723,"kind":"tag","latitude":null,"id":118,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/44\/Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg\/512px-Abraham_Lincoln_head_on_shoulders_photo_portrait.jpg","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":null,"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=118","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Republican_Party_(United_States)","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"republican-party","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":672,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T20:19:05.117092","name":"Republican Party (United States)","geohash":"","links":""},{"trend_rank_current":2,"ping_category":[],"category":"Topic","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2","woeid":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","recent_count":5,"trend_rank_last":2,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","daily_count":27,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","image_width":512,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","item_count":96331,"kind":"vertical","latitude":null,"id":2,"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","placetype":"","livevideo":"","longitude":null,"twitter_username":"breakingpol","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","muted_by_default":false,"facebookchat":"","slug":"politics","active":true,"visible":true,"image_height":503,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","name":"politics","geohash":"","links":""}],"date":"2016-06-23T18:34:41.254378","local_url":"\/item\/2016\/06\/23\/former-donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey","source":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/870578\/","submitter":"editor","updated_date":"2016-06-23T18:57:12.510827","latitude":null,"id":870578,"ping":null,"url_text":"Read more on politico.com","push_content":"Former Donald Trump campaign manager Corey reportedly joining CNN as political commentator, source tells Politico","longitude":null,"whoas":90,"type":"text","slug":"former-donald-trump-campaign-manager-corey","shortened_url":"http:\/\/politi.co\/28TFUng","note":null,"data_type":null,"status":"published","tweet":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/on-media\/2016\/06\/corey-lewandowski-to-join-cnn-224733#ixzz4CQebKE00","url_external_text":"Read more on politico.com","importance":2,"url_domain":"politico.com","pushed":true}]}
