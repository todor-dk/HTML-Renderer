In Google&#8217;s case, the company has put up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/topics\/public-policy\/net-neutrality-day-action-help-preserve-open-internet\/\">blog post<\/a> on one of its policy sites describing the case in favor of net neutrality, but not put a message on its homepage.<\/p>\n<p>As for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>, which weeks ago announced it would take part in the Day of Action, the retailer has added a &#8220;Net Neutrality?

Since Pai, a Republican, has a majority of votes on the Commission, he is likely to go ahead with his plan to rip up the rules later this summer.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 08:47:08","updated":"2017-07-12 08:47:08","minute":"8:47 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/net-neutrality-day-of-action\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/net-neutrality-day-of-action\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/net-neutrality-day-of-action\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Tech Firms Unite for 'Day of Action' on Net Neutrality","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/09\/odhbmmf.png?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"","caption":"A pro-net neutrality message on Cheezburger, a humor website","attach_id":784760},"excerpt":"A last ditch effort.","authors":[{"id":"1027427","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/jeff-john-roberts\/","name":"Jeff John Roberts","twitter":"jeffjohnroberts","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1600880\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/roberts-jeff-john\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Jeff-John Roberts\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/roberts-jeff-john.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Jeff John Roberts is a writer at <em>Fortune<\/em> with a focus on technology.

Her appearances before the House panel have sometimes involved sharp exchanges with lawmakers who think the Fed&#8217;s influence over the economy has grown too large, and who want policymakers to be guided more closely by a mathematical rule for setting interest rates.<\/p>\n<p>In a report released last week the Fed compared its current policy to that prescribed by a variety of such rules \u2014 pointing out that the choice of a rule itself involved judgments that would lead to vastly different outcomes.<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>referred House lawmakers specifically to that section of the report in her testimony.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">Yellen<\/span>&#8216;s appearance comes as the Trump administration mulls whether to replace her when her term ends in February.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. stock index futures rose on her remarks while yields on Treasuries fell and the dollar declined against a basket of currencies.<\/p>\n<p>By her testimony today, the economy is currently on an even keel, near or beyond full employment and the Fed is steadily moving rates higher. The reduction in the balance sheet, which will begin slowly as the Fed reinvests only a portion of the holdings that mature each month, will mark the final exit from crisis-related policies.<\/p>\n<p>One potential issue: the Fed wants to keep policy accommodative to continue supporting the recovery, but may be approaching a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rate faster than expected. Estimates of the inflation-adjusted neutral rate have been falling, and by some accounts may be near zero.<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>has said the Fed expects estimates of the neutral rate to rise over time. But unless that happens, or inflation picks up, the Fed may only have a few rate increases left before it hits a level that is no longer felt to be encouraging spending and investment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">Yellen <\/span>said in her testimony that as it stands rates &#8220;would not have to rise all that much further&#8221; to reach neutral.<\/p>\n<p>Though a recent dip in inflation has been of concern among Fed officials who want to see surer progress toward the central bank&#8217;s 2 percent inflation goal,<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>ascribed it to &#8220;a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices&#8221; that would eventually drop out of the calculation.<\/p>\n<p>The current situation &#8220;raises the stakes&#8221; for upcoming inflation data, said Jim Vogel, interest rate strategist for FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. &#8220;People are going to be very anxious if that was just a statistical glitch&#8230;or if it is going to continue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise,<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>said, the economy appeared to be in a virtuous loop of hiring, spending and investment that &#8220;should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

Half of the tax revenue goes to the state\u2019s general fund, half has been allocated to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adn.com\/alaska-marijuana\/2016\/07\/12\/heres-where-half-of-the-revenue-from-alaskas-legal-pot-will-go\/\">criminal reform programs.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But Nevada is the only state with a grower to seller ratio that could undermine the industry&#8217;s success, Joel Milton told the Reno Gazette Journal.

Well, today I invite you to a first-ever installment of We-Were-There Wednesday, a brief look back at some stellar <em>Fortune<\/em> journalism from the past that sheds light on the news of today.<\/p>\n<p>First, I invite you to re-read Shawn Tully&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/21\/snapchat-snap-ipo-wall-street\/\">brutal takedown<\/a> from March of the craven way Snap&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"snap\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/snap\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">snap<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> bankers handled its IPO. He called the IPO an &#8220;epic fleecing&#8221; of retail investors. Things have gotten worse for Snap\u2014though I truly enjoyed its Ferris Wheel in Cannes last month\u2014as investors have become increasingly jittery that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"fb\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">fb<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> will eat Snapchat&#8217;s lunch. Analysts at <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a>, one of Snap\u2019s underwriters, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/snapchat-stock-price-morgan-stanley\/\">lowered their targets<\/a> for Snap&#8217;s shares Tuesday. They fell 9% to $15.47, below their $17 offering price and nearly half their high of $29 and change.<\/p>\n<p>Next, I please look back at the devil of a time the venerable publisher and education company Pearson was having repositioning itself a couple years ago. Jennifer Reingold&#8217;s<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/01\/21\/everybody-hates-pearson\/\"> look at Pearson\u2019s problems<\/a> is a classic examination at how tough it is to turn around giant organizations. Pearson is ditching its stake in book publisher Penguin Random House, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/11\/business\/dealbook\/pearson-penguin-random-house-bertelsmann.html?em_pos=small&amp;emc=edit_dk_20170711&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;nl_art=3&amp;nlid=1411878&amp;ref=headline&amp;te=1&amp;_r=0\">a move that will get it money but not much else<\/a>, says Liam Proud of Reuters Breakingviews.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, I highly recommend David Whitford&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2013\/05\/23\/whats-driving-one-of-chinas-richest-men\/\">penetrating look from 2013 at Wang Jianlin, the entrepreneur behind property developer and entertainment conglomerate Wanda Group<\/a>. Wang was in the ascendance four years ago, just as <em>Fortune<\/em> was convening its Fortune Global Forum in Chengdu in Western China. Tuesday&#8217;s <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em> details how Wang and Wanda are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/dalian-wanda-to-sell-hotels-cultural-and-tourism-projects-for-9-3-billion-1499658113\">scaling back their ambitions<\/a> after bulking up on too much debt.<\/p>\n<p>Looking forward, another item caught my eye Tuesday. Mobike, the Chinese bikesharing startup that along with its chief competitor Ofo has raised more than $1 billion, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/article_email\/china-bike-sharing-titan-mobike-sets-sights-on-washington-d-c-1499702471-lMyQjAxMTI3MDE2MTgxODExWj\/\">looking to expand to Washington, D.C.<\/a> Before that happens, Mobike plans a humbler but equally exciting test. It will have 15 bikes at the disposal of guests at the Brainstorm Tech conference next week in Aspen. I plan to be among the first to try them. I&#8217;ll post a photo.<\/p>\n\n\t\t<table class=\"container\" style=\"margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;font-family: Georgia;font-size:16px;line-height: 24px;width: 90%;max-width: 602px;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n\t\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"width: 30%;\"><\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: right; font-weight: bold;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAdam Lashinsky\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td><\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a style=\"color:#0099cc; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/adamlashinsky\">@adamlashinsky<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td><\/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a style=\"color:#0099cc; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"mailto:adam_lashinsky@fortune.com\">adam_lashinsky@fortune.com<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/td>\n\t\t\t\t<\/tr>\n\t\t\t<\/tbody>\n\t\t<\/table>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 12:44:10","updated":"2017-07-12 12:44:10","minute":"12:44 PM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/we-were-there-wednesday\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/we-were-there-wednesday\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/we-were-there-wednesday\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"We Were There Wednesday ","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/05\/snapchat-broken-glass.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1","class":"featured-img-article_full","credit":"Dado Ruvic\u2014Reuters","caption":"","attach_id":"2021944"},"excerpt":"<p>Fortune was critical of some now-troubled businesses<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381316","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/adam-lashinsky\/","name":"Adam Lashinsky","twitter":"adamlashinsky","gplus":"","email":"adam_lashinsky@fortune.com","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599150\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/lashinsky-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Adam Lashinsky\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/lashinsky.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Adam Lashinsky is the executive editor of <em>Fortune<\/em>.

These P3s, he promises, provide \u201cbetter procurement methods, market discipline and a long-term focus on <span class=\"s1\">maintaining assets<\/span>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That\u2019s true enough in some cases, but P3s are no cure-all for every public project. Despite the hype, the public-private approach does not provide new funding sources to communities, nor does it work for many types of public projects.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most of us have seen a P3 at work in our community. The government contracts with a private company to finance, build, and maintain a public works project, such as a road. The company finances construction by borrowing money from banks or investors or by issuing shares of stock. After some extended period, the company will turn over the road to the government. In the meantime, the company collects tolls on the road and is responsible for maintaining it. The tolls are expected to cover the maintenance, interest, and principal on the debt and to enable the company to profit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By contrast, in the more conventional arrangement, the government contracts with a private company to construct the road and finance the project by selling tax-exempt municipal bonds or pay for it with its existing funds. The government is responsible for maintaining the road and for servicing the debt. It expects to cover its costs through taxes or tolls.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In both cases, a private company is contracted to do the work with financing from private sector capital, and all of us bear the cost burden either through tolls or taxes. There is no \u201cnew\u201d source of funding.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">P3s rearrange the risks and rewards of infrastructure projects. Under the P3 arrangement, the government does not appear to be incurring these costs because it does not have to write the checks to pay for them. However, it is sacrificing the toll revenue collected.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The private sector \u201cowner\u201d of the road bears the risk that tolls will be inadequate to cover the costs and reaps the benefits if tolls exceed anticipated costs. But if the owner incurs major losses and is forced to declare bankruptcy, it falls upon the government to take back the project and ensure that it continues. This situation is exactly what happened in Indiana recently when a private operator\u2019s bankruptcy filing threatened to cause significant construction delays on a partially completed road. Something similar happened in Texas with the Texas 130 toll road connecting San Antonio and Austin. Toll revenues did not meet expectations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But P3s are not without their benefits. They can often launch without the lengthy procedures mandated by government. P3 debt is not subject to debt limitations that the government may face and does not appear on its balance sheet. In some circumstances, the private owner of the project may, in fact, be capable of operating it more efficiently and effectively than a government can.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But ease does not equal abundance. In fact, the P3 approach does nothing to solve the fundamental infrastructure funding challenge faced by governments at the local, state, and federal levels. According to a 2017 analysis by the American Society of Civil Engineers, the U.S. has more than a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.infrastructurereportcard.org\/the-impact\/economic-impact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">$2.1 trillion gap<\/span><\/a> between current funding and estimated needs for surface transportation, airports, water, wastewater, inland waterways, and other infrastructure projects. In the end, it is the public that must provide the funding regardless of the structure of the project.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Even P3 enthusiasts will admit that many of the nation\u2019s infrastructure needs are for projects that do not generate direct revenue that would make them attractive P3 candidates. Road repaving, bridge and building maintenance, school construction, and telecommunication system expansions are common projects that may not generate revenue streams collectible through tolls or other means. The conventional government infrastructure approach is probably the only viable option for these public works.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">American infrastructure needs rebuilding, and P3s belong in the mix of remedies available to the government. However, clear heads realize that P3s are not a blanket cure for the nation\u2019s infrastructure ills, but a targeted remedy with limited effect on the larger problem\u2014a lack of funding resources.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Michael Granof is the Ernst &amp; Young professor of accounting at The University of Texas at Austin.

Now that the prices of those blockchain-based currencies have <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/12\/ethereum-bitcoin-2017-all-time-high\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risen exponentially<\/a> in recent months, however, even BlackRock&#8217;s top economists are watching closely\u2014and with some concern.<\/p>\n<p>Asked by <em>Fortune<\/em> to address cryptocurrency at a press briefing Tuesday, Richard Turnill, BlackRock&#8217;s global chief investment strategist, waded into what he called &#8220;dangerous territory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I look at blockchain, I look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">charts<\/a>, and to me that looks pretty scary, and reminiscent of what we\u2019ve seen before,&#8221; he said, referring to the characteristics of previous market bubbles, such as the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that kind of nervousness that has helped deflate some of the recent crypto enthusiasm, which this year alone propelled the Bitcoin price up more than 200% to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/11\/bitcoin-breaks-3000-bull-run\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an all-time high of $3,000<\/a> in June, and Ethereum up more than 5,100% to a peak above $400. Just days after setting those records, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-coinbase-down\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crashed as much as 25%<\/a> in a single day, and have so far been unable to recover.<\/p>\n<p>The Ethereum price is currently under $190, down more than 50% from its high less than a month ago. Bitcoin now trades at about $2,280, 24% below its peak. (But even with the selloff, the cryptocurrencies have still delivered spectacular returns in 2017 to date: the Bitcoin price has more than doubled since the start of the year, while Ethereum is worth more than 23 times its value at the end of 2016.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071464\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_value\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776\" data-orig-size=\"1220,924\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_value\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows change in Bitcoin value since 2009&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2071464\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"776\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&amp;h=776 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=300&amp;h=227 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=768&amp;h=582 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart shows change in Bitcoin value since 2009<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, is far from the first to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/03\/bitcoin-ethereum-token-crypto-bubble\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">express alarm<\/a> over the rapid appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, which are estimated to exceed a combined $100 billion\u2014greater than the stock market value of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"gs\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">gs<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. In early June, Mark Cuban tweeted about cryptocurrency, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s in a bubble,&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/mark-cuban-twitter-bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompting the price of Bitcoin to swoon 5%<\/a>. Two weeks ago, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, who has 10% of his wealth invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/29\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-buy-michael-novogratz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said he&#8217;d been selling many of his coins<\/a>, suspecting that the digital currencies had already peaked for the year. Cryptocurrency, Novogratz further predicted, &#8220;is going to be the single greatest bubble of our lifetime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Goldman Sachs itself weighed in, <a href=\"http:\/\/and Goldman Sachs: http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/03\/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-price\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warning that Bitcoin could fall<\/a> another 19% from its current levels, to as low as $1,857.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if cryptocurrency really is in a bubble, it poses less of a danger to the rest of the market if it pops than other bubbles\u2014from housing to tech stocks\u2014have historically when they burst. After all, unlike stocks and bonds, which are intricately entwined with big banks and the world financial system, Bitcoin and Ethereum exist in almost a parallel universe to conventional assets, with only tenuous links to traditional Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the price went to zero tomorrow,&#8221; Turnill noted, there likely would be no &#8220;broader financial impact at all&#8221; on any other assets. &#8220;But it\u2019s an example of where you\u2019re getting big price movements in the market,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, that&#8217;s why BlackRock is keeping tabs on cryptocurrency in the first place: Not as a prospective investment at this time, but as a potential indicator of sentiment and investor behavior in other asset classes\u2014whether gold, standard paper currency, bonds, or technology stocks.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin &#8220;can be a signal of the macro environment,&#8221; Jeffrey Rosenberg, BlackRock\u2019s chief fixed income strategist, added at the briefing. &#8220;So we do take a look at it.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 11:21:57","updated":"2017-07-11 11:21:57","minute":"11:21 PM

Week","content":"<p>Do you drink multiple cups of coffee a day?<\/p>\n<p>If you do, two new, large studies suggest that you are more likely to live longer than those who don\u2019t. Together, the studies\u2014both published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine\u2014<\/em>tracked more than 700,000 participants for an average of around 16 years. Results were consistent: coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of early death, particularly from heart and gut disease.<\/p>\n<p>The first study, which comprised of around 186,000 Americans, found that participants who consumed two or more cups a day were 18% less likely to die by the study\u2019s close (this was after the authors controlled for diet, exercise, smoking, among other factors). In the second study, which examined coffee consumption among more than 520,000 Europeans from 10 countries, found a similar effect: coffee drinkers were less likely to die than non-coffee drinkers.<\/p>\n<p>Before you run to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/starbucks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks<\/a>, it\u2019s important to note that correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation. Yes, coffee drinkers were associated with lower degrees of premature death than non-coffee drinkers. But coffee wasn&#8217;t necessarily the differentiating factor that reduced the risk of premature death. The study didn\u2019t control for everything\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-40567047\">according to the BBC<\/a>, it did not consider socio-economic status or social habits, for example. Speaking with CNN, Marc Gunter, one of the European study\u2019s authors, floated the idea that coffee drinkers are <a

neutrality rules, said it would join an online protest this week in favor of keeping the rules.<\/p>\n<p>In recognition of the &#8220;Day of Action&#8221; on July 12, the company said it would display on its website banners in favor of maintaining a &#8220;free and open&#8221; Internet.

After courts had struck down two earlier attempts to protect online openness saying the agency lacked the authority, the FCC under Obama-appointee Tom Wheeler classified Internet service providers as &#8220;common carriers&#8221; much like phone carriers. The designation, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2016\/06\/14\/471286113\/u-s-appeals-court-holds-up-net-neutrality-rules-in-full\">satisfied the courts<\/a> but stoked fears among the companies that they could be subject to more regulation in the future, including price controls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Saddling modern broadband infrastructure and investment decisions with heavy-handed, outdated telephone regulations creates an environment of market uncertainty that does little to advance internet openness,&#8221; AT&amp;T&#8217;s Quinn wrote in his blog post. &#8220;Instead, it jeopardizes the prospects for continued innovation and robust growth we have witnessed since the internet\u2019s creation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But net neutrality supporter Greer pointed out that the rules needed a strong legal underpinning after lawsuits by Internet service providers cut down earlier attempts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous, and a blatant attempt to confuse the public, that they are claiming they are joining a grassroots online protest that&#8217;s explicitly intended to defend the Title II based net neutrality protections that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support,&#8221; Greer said.<\/p>\n<p>AT&amp;T was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/02\/fcc-verizon-att-net-neutrality\/\">under investigation<\/a> by the FCC last year for potentially violating the net neutrality rules, but Pai dismissed the probe.

Revelations","content":"<p>Fresh off one foreign trip and preparing for another, Donald Trump was enjoying a period of relative calm\u2014until the White House was rocked by a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton-russia\/\">fresh controversy<\/a> over contacts between the president&#8217;s campaign and Russia.<\/p>\n<p>For Trump, who has been swept up all year in crises of his own making, this time the target was his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., whose <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/donald-trump-jr-russia-russian-lawyer-meeting\/\">meeting with a Russian lawyer<\/a> last year led to accusations that the president&#8217;s son entertained working with Russians to spread negative information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.<\/p>\n<p>Among Trump&#8217;s wide-ranging group of outside advisers and former campaign officials, Donald Jr.&#8217;s meeting with the lawyer on the expectation of gaining access to negative information on Clinton was seen as problematic, a demonstration of the son&#8217;s political inexperience, but not illegal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t shrug this off even though you know he&#8217;s very likely going to be okay,&#8221; said an outside Trump adviser, who asked to remain unidentified. &#8220;This is the president&#8217;s namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the president&#8217;s son.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind that every person in the White House has some level of concern about this. Otherwise it&#8217;s malpractice,&#8221; the adviser said.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russia&#8217;s meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president&#8217;s agenda.<\/p>\n<p>The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/angela-merkel-ivanka-trump-g20\/\">trip<\/a> to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/trump-putin-russia-election-interference\/\">meeting<\/a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He knows that he didn&#8217;t do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesn&#8217;t like it when things get in the way,&#8221; a senior White House official said.<\/p>\n<p>The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his &#8220;high-quality person&#8221; who showed &#8220;transparency&#8221; by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, it&#8217;s still not a smoking gun,&#8221; said one former campaign adviser.<\/p>\n<p>Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events.<\/p>\n<p>Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/quinhillyer.com\/trump-should-resign\/\">in a blog post<\/a> that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. &#8220;The American people absolutely cannot trust Trump\u2019s objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions,&#8221; Hillyer wrote. &#8220;This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case &#8220;unfortunately supports the narrative&#8221; advanced by Trump&#8217;s Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic,&#8221; the adviser said. &#8220;A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

traveling through Trump country (West Virginia and Kentucky) last weekend in an effort to rally opposition to Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. These efforts notwithstanding, Sanders still refuses to embrace Obamacare. \u201cAs soon as we defeat this disastrous bill, I will be introducing a Medicare-for-all, single-payer program,\u201d he said during the rally. He hasn\u2019t even embraced the Democratic Party, despite his bid to become the Democratic presidential nominee. When asked if he was a Democrat, he <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2017\/07\/bernie-sanders-health-care-republicans-trump\/533109\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">responded<\/a>, \u201cNot even remotely anymore. The Democratic Party now is a disaster, an absolute mess. I don\u2019t see a party now that represents me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sanders still describes himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d rejecting the moderate left progressivism of the Clintons, as he emphasized in his presidential campaign. According to Sanders, the Clintons embraced Wall Street, where Hillary Clinton had made hundreds of thousands of dollars giving speeches, following in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, who during his presidency had deregulated banks by signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, repealing the Glass-Steagall cornerstone of New Deal banking reform. The Clintons had accommodated consolidations and mergers in the world of banking, they had encouraged the growth of too-big-to-fail big banks, and Sanders was the only candidate willing to take on <a href=\"https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/reforming-wall-street\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wall Street<\/a> and break up the big banks.<\/p>\n<p>Putting aside the question of the practicality of a break-up-the-big-banks reform agenda, we should pose a simpler, conceptual question first: Why would a socialist want to break up big banks? Socialists want to nationalize banks, not break them up. If anything, socialists prefer bank consolidation to simplify the administrative task of running a nationalized banking system. Nationalization is the only path to provide the collective ownership of the means of production (in this case, the production of financial products). Socialism entails the abolition of private property in business life, but breaking up banks would leave banks as privately owned enterprises still seeking to make profits through the marketplace. Socialists argue that profit-making in a competitive market leads inevitably to exploitation and alienation.<\/p>\n<p>The proposal to break up the banks sounds more like the trust-busting Progressive Era agenda one would associate with Woodrow Wilson than anything socialist. Eugene Debs, not Woodrow Wilson, was the socialist of the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/progressive\/\" target=\"_blank\">Progressive<\/a> Era, and Debs had been sufficiently schooled in Marxist theory to realize that socialism required the abolition or private ownership of the means of production. Sanders admires Debs (he had a picture of Debs displayed in City Hall when he was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/powerpost\/wp\/2016\/01\/22\/the-daily-202-bernie-sanders-has-a-eugene-v-debs-problem\/?utm_term=.1152d30725f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mayor<\/a> of Burlington, Vt., but it isn\u2019t clear he understood the radical agenda Debs had embraced. Is it possible that the only prominent national politician who describes himself as a socialist today is clueless regarding the meaning to the term socialism?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/democratic-socialism-in-the-united-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prepared remarks<\/a> by Sanders on democratic socialism suggest as much. He begins his commentary on democratic socialism by focusing on Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s 1937 inaugural address, where Roosevelt famously stated that one-third of the nation was &#8220;ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.\u201d Sanders identifies with FDR and his campaign against the \u201ceconomic royalists,\u201d praising New Deal policies for succeeding in putting \u201cmillions back to work\u201d and taking \u201cthem out of poverty\u201d and restoring \u201ctheir faith in government.\u201d Democrats would almost universally share these laudatory views of Franklin Roosevelt, but Sanders proceeds to note that almost everything FDR proposed was called &#8220;socialist.\u201d Does this make FDR a socialist? The implication of Sanders\u2019 logic, given that he embraces both FDR and democratic socialism, is that because FDR\u2019s enemies labeled his agenda socialist, he was a socialist. FDR\u2019s political enemies also called him a dictator, especially after he introduced his court-packing bill. Did that make FDR a dictator?<\/p>\n<p>Later in his speech, Sanders finally defines what democratic socialism means to him. \u201cDemocratic socialism means that we must create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy,\u201d he said. Adam Smith, the author of the <em>The Wealth of Nations<\/em> in 1776 and the father of capitalism, would have said that capitalism intends to &#8220;create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy&#8221; (Sanders\u2019 definition of democratic socialism).<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"6\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5219073860001-6\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5219073860001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uf0TfU\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dberniesanders%2Cdonaldtrump%2Cinfrastructureplan%2Cinfrastructureplanscam%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Dberniesanders&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Sanders concedes, \u201cI don\u2019t believe government should own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth deserve a fair deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sanders isn\u2019t a socialist. He is an American progressive. Given the dismal history of socialism in the 20th century, which is inextricably intertwined with the history of totalitarianism, Sanders would do well to start using words with their conventional meaning. The only cause that Sanders\u2019 idiosyncratic usage of words promotes is his own political ambition.<\/p>\n<div class=\"column _-5s7sjXv\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"column small-12\">\n<article class=\"row\">\n<p class=\"column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 end text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4\"><i>Donald Brand is a professor of political science at the College of the Holy Cross.<\/i><\/p>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 04:34:53","updated":"2017-07-11 04:34:53","minute":"4:34 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bernie-sanders-obamacare-socialism\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bernie-sanders-obamacare-socialism\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bernie-sanders-obamacare-socialism\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Why Bernie Sanders Isn\u2019t Actually a Socialist","post_type":"post","featured_type":"image","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/07\/gettyimages-811494396.jpg?w=800&h=488&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_must_reads_2x","credit":"JAY LAPRETE AFP\/Getty Images","caption":"US Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) addresses a rally in support of the Affordable Care Act in Covington, Kentucky on July 9, 2017.","attach_id":2089102},"excerpt":"<p>He&#8217;s an American progressive.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"1591940","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/donald-brand\/","name":"Donald Brand","twitter":"brand_donald","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":447823559,"name":"Fortune Insiders","slug":"fortune-insiders","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":122920,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Ideas from the brightest minds in business.","parent":0,"count":3553,"filter":"raw"}],"section":{"name":"Fortune Insiders","slug":"fortune-insiders","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune-insiders\/","newsletter_info":"The Fortune CEO Daily"},"tags":[{"term_id":447824372,"name":"Bernie Sanders","slug":"bernie-sanders","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":129601,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":584,"filter":"raw"},{"term_id":271,"name":"Commentary","slug":"commentary","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":111707,"taxonomy":"post_tag","description":"","parent":0,"count":4616,"filter":"raw"}],"has_commentary_tag":true,"primary_tag":{"name":"Bernie Sanders","slug":"bernie-sanders","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/tag\/bernie-sanders\/"},"f500_tag":false,"paid":false,"paid_excerpt":"He&#8217;s an American progressive.","seo":{"seo_title":"Bernie Sanders Obamacare Rally: Not Socialist","seo_description":"Donald Brand, a professor of political science at the College of the Holy Cross, explains why.","seo_keywords":"Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, trumpcare, healthcare, health care, socialist, Obamacare, socialism, FDR","seo_news_keywords":"Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, trumpcare, healthcare, health care, socialist, Obamacare, socialism, FDR","seo_additional_meta":""},"social":{"url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bernie-sanders-obamacare-socialism\/","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ffortune.com%2F2017%2F07%2F11%2Fbernie-sanders-obamacare-socialism%2F","shortlink":"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uf0TfU","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Ffor.tn%2F2uf0TfU","encoded_title":"Why+Bernie+Sanders+Isn%E2%80%99t+Actually+a+Socialist","twitter_text":"Why Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t actually a socialist","twitter_via":"FORTUNE","facebook_desc":"Donald Brand, a professor of political science at the College of the Holy Cross, explains why.","facebook_title":"Why Bernie Sanders Isn\u2019t Actually a Socialist"},"format":{"term_id":2710,"name":"Article","slug":"fortune-post-format-article","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":3,"taxonomy":"fortune_post_format","description":"","parent":0,"count":67745,"filter":"raw"},"related_posts":[],"in_article_ad_id":["in-article-ad-2087852-0","in-article-ad-2087852-1","in-article-ad-2087852-2"]},{"id":2087885,"content_type":"free full","is_magazine_content":"non-magazine","url":"\/2017\/07\/11\/los-angeles-paris-2024-2028-olympics\/","title":"IOC to Pick Los Angeles, Paris for 2024 or 2028 Olympics","content":"<p>If they can agree who goes first, Paris and Los Angeles will be awarded the<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/la-2024-olympic-pitch-ioc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 2024 and 2028 Olympics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>International Olympic Committee members voted unanimously to seek a consensus three-way deal between the two bid cities and the IOC executive board.

A 10% sales tax goes to the Nevada&#8217;s rainy day fund, but a 15% cultivation tax on cannabis sales goes to the public education budget.<\/p>\n<p>If the supply problem isn&#8217;t remedied, it could take some serious bake sales to make up for the lost baked sales.<\/p>\n<p>Nevada isn&#8217;t alone in allocating some of its pot tax revenue to education. Of the other four states where recreational marijuana is legal, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington all direct some funds to schools.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Colorado has a 10% retail marijuana sales tax and a 15% retail excise tax. Marijuana tax revenue contributed more than $65 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorado.gov\/pacific\/sites\/default\/files\/2016%20Annual%20Report.pdf\">to public education <\/a>in the state over the last two years.<\/li>\n<li>Oregon has a 17% state tax, with the option for municipalities to add up to 3% local tax. Forty percent of the tax revenue goes to the state\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oregon.gov\/DOR\/press\/Documents\/marijuana_fact_sheet.pdf\">Common School Fund.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Washington has a 15% tax on wholesale marijuana and an 8% state tax on retail sales prices as of this month, down from 10% before that. Nearly <a href=\"http:\/\/lcb.wa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/publications\/annual_report\/2016-annual-report-Final-opt.pdf\">one third of marijuana tax revenue<\/a> goes to the state\u2019s general fund which can be used for education and other critical services.<\/li>\n<li>In Alaska, the tax is $50 per ounce, or about a 20% effective tax rate on cultivators. Half of the tax revenue goes to the state\u2019s general fund, half has been allocated to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adn.com\/alaska-marijuana\/2016\/07\/12\/heres-where-half-of-the-revenue-from-alaskas-legal-pot-will-go\/\">criminal reform programs.<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>But Nevada is the only state with a grower to seller ratio that could undermine the industry&#8217;s success, Joel Milton told the Reno Gazette Journal. He&#8217;s CEO of Baker, a company that helps dispensaries with marketing and management.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In Colorado, we have more than two-and-a-half times as many cultivators as dispensaries, and in Washington, there are one-and-a-half more. In Nevada, there is a lower ratio, it is about one to one.

descriptor that comes to mind when one thinks of queso\u2014the thick sauce of cheese that\u2019s a perfect pairing with nachos. For one thing, cheese is not meant to remain in such an unspoiled liquid form indefinitely.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cQueso is difficult to make if you\u2019re going to use real ingredients,\u201d says Mark Crumpacker, Chipotle\u2019s chief marketing and developing officer, noting that a lot of queso includes industrial additives and preservatives.<\/p>\n<p>But Chipotle doesn\u2019t use those kinds of additives. The company has made its commitment to \u201creal\u201d ingredients with no added flavors, colors, or <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/29\/chipotle-removes-preservatives\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">preservatives<\/a> a central tenet of its offering and a point of differentiation compared to other chains. This posed a major challenge for Chipotle, whose customers have asked for queso for two decades, Crumpacker tells <em>Fortune<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>But earlier this week Chipotle signaled that it had cracked the code on queso when the item appeared on the menu at <a href=\"https:\/\/ny.eater.com\/2017\/7\/10\/15945712\/chipotle-queso-margaritas-chelsea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chipotle NEXT Kitchen<\/a>, the company\u2019s first test kitchen open to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Crumpacker says the company was able to get queso on the menu by adding only two ingredients\u2014corn starch and tapioca starch\u2014to its previous total list of 51 that is uses in its food. The addition of the two starches enabled the company to prevent the two common queso problems: separation and the formation of a skin.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the two starches and cheese, the queso is made with hot and medium salsa, picked jalapeno, and sofrito\u2014a blend of herbs and spices.<\/p>\n<p>The NEXT Kitchen is being overseen by a strategy team at Chipotle led by Crumpacker, who says it\u2019s \u201ccharged with determining what the future of what Chipotle might be.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The launch of the NEXT Kitchen comes as Chipotle battles its way out of a highly challenged period for the company, which began in 2015 with a string of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/02\/chipotle-sales-decline-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food safety crises<\/a>. Last year revenue fell 13% and profits plunge 95%.<\/p>\n<p>After hopeful signs in April with double-digit positive quarterly same store sales, an important industry metric, the company disappointed investors last moth when it said its 2017 figure would be in the high-single digits\u2014below analyst estimates.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to queso, the company is also testing virgin and alcoholic margaritas and a mixed-greens salad with avocado vinaigrette. Its also trying out a spicy chocolate dipping sauce to accompany the sweet chips it rolled out to test markets in May. (Crumpackers says the previous apple sauce led to too much sweetness in combination with the already-sweet chips.)<\/p>\n<p>Even the possibility of new menu items is a departure from Chipotle\u2019s traditional strategy of avoiding the limited-time-offer game that so many rivals play\u2014a move meant to generate news and reignite consumer interest in a brand.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSince Chipotle was started 24 years ago, not a lot has been added to the menu,\u201d says Crumpacker, pointing to salad, its spiced tofu called sofritas, and chorizo as the few additions. Crumpacker notes that this is a very deliberate choice: \u201cIt\u2019s always been [CEO Steve Ells\u2019s] philosophy to do a few things, and do them really well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Crumpacker says that Chipotle\u2019s commitment to using fresh ingredients and traditional cooking methods means that additions to the menu can slow down the experience for customers. That\u2019s why the company isn\u2019t serving chorizo in the NEXT Kitchen\u2014when queso came on, chorizo came off. \u201cIt\u2019s deliberate and borne out of necessity,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p>Right now queso is only available at the NEXT Kitchen, located in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood. The combination restaurant-test kitchen is meant to speed up the time to get new products to market. Before opening up this location, Chipotle would test its products through a private kitchen, which required an additional step of proving a new item worked operationally with equipment and crew in stores before rolling it out more broadly.<\/p>\n<p>Crumpacker declined to provide a timeline for when customers might see queso nationally. But it\u2019s likely to be before the new salad, which requires more prep and training for the crew.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 10:43:11","updated":"2017-07-12 10:43:11","minute":"10:43 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/chipotle-test-kitchen-queso\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/chipotle-test-kitchen-queso\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/chipotle-test-kitchen-queso\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"20\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5392518608001-20\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5392518608001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tI9LZW\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dasrealasitgets%2Cchipotle%2Cchipotleadcampaign%2Cchipotleburrito%2Cchipotlecampaign%2Cchipotlefood%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dchipotle&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>It finally cracked the code.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381326","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/beth-kowitt\/","name":"Beth Kowitt","twitter":"bethkowitt","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599149\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/kowitt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Beth Kowitt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Beth Kowitt is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine, where she covers food and agriculture, consumer behavior, and sustainability.

But he was, of course, an agent of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, acting on his father\u2019s behalf, when he arranged the meeting with the Russian lawyer. The younger Trump successfully invited to that meeting senior campaign brass, including campaign manager Paul Manafort. Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior advisor, and Manafort are included on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.justsecurity.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/donald-jr-emails-russia.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s1\">entire email chain<\/span><\/a> reflecting in clear terms the Russian government\u2019s support for the Trump campaign and the scheduling of the meeting so that a Russian government lawyer could tender negative information on Clinton.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not an individual venture of Trump Jr.\u2019s that the Trump campaign can somehow disavow. While the individuals in question may not escape liability, the serious issue raised by the meeting exposes the campaign <i>as an organization<\/i> to criminal legal jeopardy. Any illegal solicitation of support from Russia is also the campaign\u2019s illegal solicitation. It was for the campaign\u2019s benefit that its leadership expressed interest in what the lawyer had to say.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Under campaign finance regulations, the meeting could without question be considered a solicitation (at least under the facts so far known). The law defines a solicitation to include any request for a contribution or \u201canything of value\u201d from a foreign government or entity, even if the request is implicit in the circumstances rather than expressly communicated. The regulations provide specifically that the solicitation \u201cmay be made directly or indirectly,\u201d based on all relevant factors, including the \u201cconduct of the persons involved in the communication.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Consider the email exchange Trump Jr. released on Twitter on Tuesday. The emails contained a clear offer of information from Russian government sources that might be helpful to the campaign. Trump Jr. responded, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d That is, he would glad to have the content described by the intermediary for the Russians. He then scheduled the meeting to consider whatever the Russians had. All these facts together indicate that, rather than declining the offer and rejecting a meeting, the campaign was communicating its interest in receiving this negative material. For campaign finance law purposes, and in the words of the ban on solicitations, the campaign was issuing \u201ca clear message\u201d that the Russians provide something \u201cof value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The campaign now must answer whether any overtures to Russia were part of a concerted effort to have foreign national support for the Trump candidacy. President Trump famously and publicly appealed to Russia for help in locating the deleted Clinton emails, but later claimed that he was only joking. And some have thought that perhaps Trump Jr. went rogue and acted, out of inexperience, on his own. But the email string released by Trump Jr., which was copied to the campaign management, followed by the meeting attended by senior campaign leadership, reveals a campaign aware of offers of Russian support and expressing eagerness to accept it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of course, the campaign is Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, his authorized committee for seeking election to the presidency. Was he aware that the campaign was courting assistance from the Russian government? Will his campaign team all testify that on an organizational initiative so central to his electoral strategy, they said nothing to the candidate about these communications from and with Russia?

On Wednesday, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Activision Blizzard<\/a> formally announced the owners of the first seven teams from the video gaming giant&#8217;s much-anticipated new city-based professional eSports league.<\/p>\n<p>The Overwatch League, which is set to launch at an unspecified date later this year, will feature teams based in major cities around the world comprised of professional gamers facing off at Activision Blizzard&#8217;s popular new game title, <em>Overwatch<\/em>. (For more on the game itself, which launched last year and now has more than 30 million players worldwide, read <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/\"><em>Fortune<\/em>&#8216;s profile<\/a> of Activision Blizzard that appeared in the <em>Fortune<\/em> 500 issue of the magazine last month.)<\/p>\n<p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and New York Mets chief operating officer Jeff Wilpon are among those who have signed agreements to participate in the league, and they will own Overwatch League team in Boston and New York, respectively, Activision Blizzard said in a press release. (Wilpon, the son of Mets owner Fred Wilpon, bought into the league through the venture capital fund Sterling.VC, in which he is a partner.) <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/03\/22\/sacramento-kings-owner-says-new-nba-arena-was-designed-for-esports\/\">Andy Miller<\/a>, the co-owner of the NBA&#8217;s Sacramento Kings and the chairman of NRG eSports, will own the league&#8217;s San Francisco-based team. The other new team owners and cities include Noah Winston (Los Angeles), CEO of the <a href=\"http:\/\/deadline.com\/2017\/06\/aeg-extends-esports-ties-investment-popular-franchise-immortals-1202116562\/\">AEG-backed<\/a> eSports franchise Immortals, which also has funding from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/17662888\/memphis-grizzlies-owner-stephen-kaplan-increases-stake-immortals\">owner of the NBA&#8217;s Memphis Grizzlies<\/a>; Ben Spoont (Miami-Orlando), the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/15916893\/misfits-purchased-org-backed-syfy-co-founder-adds-ignar-hans\">Misfits Gaming<\/a>; Kevin Chou (Seoul), the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2014\/11\/10\/kabam-kevin-chou-secret-how-to-make-a-hit-videogame\/\">co-founder of mobile gaming company<\/a> Kabam; and, the Chinese internet company NetEase, which will run a team based in Shanghai.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Overwatch League will celebrate and reward our most accomplished players and give fans more opportunities to engage with each other,&#8221; Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said in a statement. &#8220;We\u2019re excited to be working with leaders from eSports and traditional sports to celebrate our players and to establish the <em>Overwatch<\/em> League.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/19872943\/new-england-patriots-robert-kraft-new-york-mets-fred-wilpon-six-owners-buy-new-esports-venture-overwatch-league\">ESPN report<\/a> citing anonymous sources last week was the first to identify some of the Overwatch League&#8217;s initial team owners. Nate Nanzer, Blizzard Entertainment&#8217;s former global eSports director, who will serve as commissioner of the Overwatch League, tells <em>Fortune<\/em> in an interview that additional teams could be announced before the league officially kicks off later this year. Activision Blizzard said on Wednesday that the league&#8217;s first season will see teams competing at regular season matches in Los Angeles, with the teams eventually developing their own local venues to set up &#8220;home and away&#8221; match-ups for future seasons.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em style=\"text-align:center;\">Get <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em><span style=\"text-align:center;\">Fortune<\/span><em style=\"text-align:center;\">&#8216;s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The Overwatch League is the first major eSports league to be built like a traditional professional sports league, with each team attached to a specific city or region in order to build local fanbases. Activision Blizzard&#8217;s league also has the benefit of owning Major League Gaming, an organization that creates and distributes eSports events and coverage, which gives the company an obvious streaming outlet for self-distributing Overwatch League content on top of the money that Activision Blizzard expects to bring in through ticket sales, advertising, and merchandise. (Some Overwatch eSports events are included in a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/20\/twitch-activision-blizzard-esports-deal\/\">digital rights deal<\/a> that Activision Blizzard signed with Amazon&#8217;s streaming video service Twitch last month, but Nanzer said that Overwatch League events are not part of that deal at the moment.)<\/p>\n<p>The eSports industry is expected to pull in roughly $700 million this year and that total could be <a href=\"https:\/\/newzoo.com\/insights\/articles\/esports-revenues-will-reach-696-million-in-2017\/\">more than double by 2020<\/a>. Activision Blizzard plans to take advantage of the industry&#8217;s expected growth, with a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/dotesports.com\/overwatch\/morgan-stanley-activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-data-report-13812\">report<\/a> earlier this year estimating that the league could pull in more than $100 million annually, mostly from content licensing and advertising initially. However, the company hopes the Overwatch League can eventually generate multi-billion-dollar annual revenues on par with traditional sports leagues, like the NFL. &#8220;The business model [of the NFL] is they create content, they build an audience around that content, and then they monetize the audience through media rights, sponsorship, merchandise, tickets, etc.&#8221; Nanzer tells <em>Fortune<\/em>. &#8220;The business model of the Overwatch League is exactly the same.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>Overwatch<\/em> is actually not the most popular title developed by Activision Blizzard&#8217;s Blizzard Entertainment (the <em>Call of Duty<\/em> franchise has sold more than 250 million units, while <em>World of Warcraft<\/em> has more than 100 million registered users online), but the game&#8217;s following has grown rapidly since Activision Blizzard launched the title just last year, becoming the company&#8217;s fastest game to reach 30 million players. What&#8217;s more, other more established Activision Blizzard game titles are already widely played in existing eSports leagues, which is why the company believes it makes sense to make a fresh start by launching its own league with the newer title.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.espn.com\/esports\/story\/_\/id\/19347153\/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms\">ESPN reported<\/a> that some prospective team owners had expressed concerns over the Overwatch League&#8217;s proposed financials, which reportedly include $20 million buy-ins for the team owners. (Nanzer declined to comment on the size of the owners&#8217; team purchases.) And while ESPN said at the time that prospective owners were balking at a lack of revenue-sharing, Activision Blizzard&#8217;s announcement on Tuesday notes that the league&#8217;s teams will receive equal shares of league-wide net revenue along with a set amount of local revenues.<\/p>\n<p>Nanzer contends that the league&#8217;s financial structure is &#8220;designed to create value for stakeholders for decades to come,&#8221; especially with regard to the attractive demographics (the eSports industry is especially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.si.com\/tech-media\/2017\/02\/09\/esports-industry-expectations-billion-dollar\">popular with male millennials<\/a>) as well as the opportunity to grow local fanbases. &#8220;We think that by anchoring teams to cities, giving our teams exclusive territories, they&#8217;re going to be able to unlock significant revenues that are just not available in today&#8217;s eSports ecosystem,&#8221; Nanzer says.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 08:00:36","updated":"2017-07-12 08:00:36","minute":"8:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":true,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-owners-robert-kraft\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-owners-robert-kraft\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/activision-blizzard-overwatch-league-owners-robert-kraft\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Activision Blizzard Lands Owners From NBA, NFL, MLB","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"22\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5461693639001-22\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5461693639001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2t1h3cx\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/entertainment_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dactivision%2Cactivisionblizzard%2Cblizzard%2Ccallofduty%2Ccallofdutyinfinitewarfare%2Ccallofdutywwii%2Ccod%2Cesports%2Cesports%2Cfirstpersonshooter%2Cleague%2Cmlg%2Coverwatch%2Cworldofwarcraft%2Cwow%26ch%3Dentertainment%26topic%3Dactivisionblizzard&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Including owners of the New England Patriots and Sacramento Kings.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"276852","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/tom-huddleston-jr\/","name":"Tom Huddleston, Jr.","twitter":"tjhuddle","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1595515\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=1595515\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Tom Huddleston\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/huddleston.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Tom Huddleston, Jr. has been a writer at <em>Fortune<\/em> since 2014 with a focus on media and entertainment.

Now that the prices of those blockchain-based currencies have <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/12\/ethereum-bitcoin-2017-all-time-high\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risen exponentially<\/a> in recent months, however, even BlackRock&#8217;s top economists are watching closely\u2014and with some concern.<\/p>\n<p>Asked by <em>Fortune<\/em> to address cryptocurrency at a press briefing Tuesday, Richard Turnill, BlackRock&#8217;s global chief investment strategist, waded into what he called &#8220;dangerous territory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I look at blockchain, I look at the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">charts<\/a>, and to me that looks pretty scary, and reminiscent of what we\u2019ve seen before,&#8221; he said, referring to the characteristics of previous market bubbles, such as the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that kind of nervousness that has helped deflate some of the recent crypto enthusiasm, which this year alone propelled the Bitcoin price up more than 200% to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/11\/bitcoin-breaks-3000-bull-run\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an all-time high of $3,000<\/a> in June, and Ethereum up more than 5,100% to a peak above $400. Just days after setting those records, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-coinbase-down\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">crashed as much as 25%<\/a> in a single day, and have so far been unable to recover.<\/p>\n<p>The Ethereum price is currently under $190, down more than 50% from its high less than a month ago. Bitcoin now trades at about $2,280, 24% below its peak. (But even with the selloff, the cryptocurrencies have still delivered spectacular returns in 2017 to date: the Bitcoin price has more than doubled since the start of the year, while Ethereum is worth more than 23 times its value at the end of 2016.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071464\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_value\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776\" data-orig-size=\"1220,924\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_value\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows change in Bitcoin value since 2009&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2071464\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&#038;h=776\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"776\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=1024&amp;h=776 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=300&amp;h=227 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png?w=768&amp;h=582 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_value.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart shows change in Bitcoin value since 2009<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, is far from the first to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/03\/bitcoin-ethereum-token-crypto-bubble\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">express alarm<\/a> over the rapid appreciation in the value of cryptocurrencies, which are estimated to exceed a combined $100 billion\u2014greater than the stock market value of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"gs\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">gs<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. In early June, Mark Cuban tweeted about cryptocurrency, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s in a bubble,&#8221; <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/mark-cuban-twitter-bitcoin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">prompting the price of Bitcoin to swoon 5%<\/a>. Two weeks ago, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, who has 10% of his wealth invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/29\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-buy-michael-novogratz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said he&#8217;d been selling many of his coins<\/a>, suspecting that the digital currencies had already peaked for the year. Cryptocurrency, Novogratz further predicted, &#8220;is going to be the single greatest bubble of our lifetime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Last week, Goldman Sachs itself weighed in, <a href=\"http:\/\/and Goldman Sachs: http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/03\/goldman-sachs-bitcoin-price\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">warning that Bitcoin could fall<\/a> another 19% from its current levels, to as low as $1,857.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if cryptocurrency really is in a bubble, it poses less of a danger to the rest of the market if it pops than other bubbles\u2014from housing to tech stocks\u2014have historically when they burst. After all, unlike stocks and bonds, which are intricately entwined with big banks and the world financial system, Bitcoin and Ethereum exist in almost a parallel universe to conventional assets, with only tenuous links to traditional Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If the price went to zero tomorrow,&#8221; Turnill noted, there likely would be no &#8220;broader financial impact at all&#8221; on any other assets. &#8220;But it\u2019s an example of where you\u2019re getting big price movements in the market,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, that&#8217;s why BlackRock is keeping tabs on cryptocurrency in the first place: Not as a prospective investment at this time, but as a potential indicator of sentiment and investor behavior in other asset classes\u2014whether gold, standard paper currency, bonds, or technology stocks.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin &#8220;can be a signal of the macro environment,&#8221; Jeffrey Rosenberg, BlackRock\u2019s chief fixed income strategist, added at the briefing. &#8220;So we do take a look at it.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 11:21:57","updated":"2017-07-11 11:21:57","minute":"11:21 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-bubble-blackrock\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-bubble-blackrock\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/bitcoin-ethereum-price-bubble-blackrock\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"BlackRock's Top Economist Thinks Bitcoin and Ethereum Look Like a Bubble","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"23\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5444053598001-23\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5444053598001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uONzMa\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbitcoin%2Cblockchain%2Cdigitalcurrency%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>&#8220;To me that looks pretty scary,&#8221;

Overall, 12% of adults <a href=\"http:\/\/tmsnrt.rs\/2sUQIYJ\">said they did the same thing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Subscription revenue is likely to come under scrutiny starting next week when TV industry players begin reporting quarterly earnings. Netflix, the dominant streaming service, releases its results on Monday.<\/p>\n<p>Up to now, Netflix and other streaming networks have accepted some password-sharing, but they may face pressure from investors to change course if new sign-ups slow substantially, Wall Street analysts said. Revenue growth at Netflix is projected to drop from 31% in this year&#8217;s second quarter to 19% in the second quarter of next year, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If Netflix goes from a 30% revenue growth story to a 10% story, there is absolutely going to be more focus on their leaving money on the table,&#8221; said Justin <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/patterson\/\" target=\"_blank\">Patterson<\/a>, an analyst with Raymond James.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix declined to comment.<\/p>\n<p>Respondents to the Reuters\/Ipsos survey said they borrow passwords to save money on video subscriptions, which can be cheap on their own but add up with multiple services.<\/p>\n<p>Donielle Bradshaw, a live-in nanny in Smyrna, Georgia, said she uses her 28-year-old sister\u2019s password for Hulu, and her 32-year-old brother\u2019s password for Netflix.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like since we are family, it\u2019s OK,&#8221; said the 22-year-old Bradshaw, who estimates she watches four hours of shows on weeknights and 10 hours a day on weekends.<\/p>\n<p>If companies cracked down on password sharing, Bradshaw said she would be willing to pay for her own Netflix subscription but is not sure about Hulu, which is owned by several media companies. &#8220;I binge a lot of shows on Netflix. I don\u2019t think I could do without it,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Companies say they accept some sharing as a way to promote their programming to potential customers, but they also take steps to curtail blatant freeloading.<\/p>\n<p>Many networks limit the number of people who can watch programming at the same time. Netflix, for example, allows two to four simultaneous streams per subscription, depending on the plan, and charges more for the higher number of streams.<\/p>\n<p>HBO, a unit of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/time-warner\/\" target=\"_blank\">Time Warner<\/a>, actually encourages younger viewers to use its HBO Now and HBO Go services for free by offering it to about 100 U.S. colleges and universities.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more about Netflix, watch<\/em>: <div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"24\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5393939030001-24\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5393939030001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uOPZdK\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Chulu%2Cnetflix%2Cnetflixcompetition%2Cstreamingservices%2Cyoutube%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dnetflix&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For us it\u2019s more important that at that age where they are not financially independent quite yet, they are habituating to using the product to ultimately aspiring to becoming paid customers,&#8221; Bernadette Aulestia, executive vice president of global distribution, said in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>Netflix executives also have said they know some viewers share passwords.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We could crack down on it, but you wouldn&#8217;t suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,&#8221; Netflix chief financial officer David Wells said at a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/goldman-sachs-group\/\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs<\/a> conference last September.<\/p>\n<h2>Missing a chance<\/h2>\n<p>Industry analysts say companies are missing a chance to grow revenue.

But in private, Trump has raged against the latest Russia development, with most of his ire directed at the media, not his son, according to people who have spoken to him in recent days.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted that his son was &#8220;open, transparent and innocent,&#8221; again referring to the investigation as &#8220;the greatest Witch Hunt in political history.&#8221; The president also questioned the sources of the media reporting on the story, despite the fact that his son personally released four pages of emails in which he communicates with an associate claiming to be arranging a meeting with a Russian government lawyer.<\/p>\n<p>The bombshell revelation that Trump Jr. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/12\/donald-trump-jr-emails-russia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was eager to accept information from Moscow<\/a> landed hard on weary White House aides. While staffers have grown accustomed to a good news cycle being overshadowed by the Russia investigations, Trump aides and outside advisers privately acknowledged that this week&#8217;s developments felt more serious.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-twitter-russia-releases-email-chain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In the emails<\/a>, the intermediary says the attorney has negative information about Democrat Hillary Clinton that is part of the Russian government&#8217;s efforts to help Trump in the campaign. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-hillary-clinton-russia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The then-candidate&#8217;s son responds: &#8220;I love it.&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>This new setback raises new questions about whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow during the election, a charge the president has denied for months. And it points those questions more directly at the inner circle of Trump&#8217;s own family.<\/p>\n<p>As has been the pattern for Trump&#8217;s White House, the controversy has sparked a new round of recriminations among the president&#8217;s team. Nearly a dozen White House officials and outside advisers spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the mood in the West Wing.<\/p>\n<p>The president, in conversations with confidants, has questioned the quality of advice he has received from senior staff, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. However, Priebus has been a frequent target of criticism for months and even those taking aim at him now said it did not appear as though a shakeup was on the horizon.<\/p>\n<p>There has also been a difference of opinion within the West Wing as to how to handle the crisis, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/donald-trump-jr-russia-meeting-natalia-veselnitskaya\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with some aides favoring more transparency than others<\/a>. Some of the unhappiness centers on Trump&#8217;s legal team, which is led by New York attorney Marc Kasowitz.<\/p>\n<p>An unusual statement Saturday night from the legal team&#8217;s spokesman Mark Corallo appeared to claim Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort were duped into meeting with the Russian lawyer, and was viewed as particularly unhelpful by senior White House officials.<\/p>\n<p>The president, again on Twitter, pushed back Wednesday on the narrative of a dysfunctional administration, writing that the White House &#8220;is functioning perfectly&#8221; and claiming that &#8220;I have very little time for watching T.V.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At least 10 of the president&#8217;s tweets since Monday have been about TV shows or links to videos from the Fox News Channel.<\/p>\n<p>The revelations come at a pivotal moment for Trump and the Republican Party, as GOP senators race to finish work on a health care overhaul that has divided the party. Trump has largely stayed on the sidelines of the policy negotiations on the measure, but has still publicly pressed GOP senators to wrap up work on legislation this summer and fulfill one of the party&#8217;s central promises to voters.<\/p>\n<p>On Capitol Hill, some Republican lawmakers cast the Russia controversy as a distraction from the health care debate.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We ought to be disciplined and not be distracted by things that may be legitimate but not right now in our lane,&#8221; said Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina.<\/p>\n<p>The matter has also distracted from a brief stretch in which some White House advisers believed they were finding their footing.<\/p>\n<p>Trump aides, who view clashes with the media as central to the president&#8217;s agenda, were emboldened when three journalists from CNN resigned after the network withdrew a story about a Trump ally. Trump&#8217;s allies were also heartened by his trip to Europe last week, feeling that his speech saluting national pride in Poland was a high point of his presidency and believing that he held his own during meetings with foreign leaders at an international summit in Germany.<\/p>\n<p>But the afterglow of Trump&#8217;s trip quickly vanished, replaced once again with questions about the swirling federal and congressional investigations into Russia&#8217;s election meddling.<\/p>\n<p>And Trump allies took notice Tuesday when Vice President Mike Pence distanced himself from the revelation by the president&#8217;s son. In a statement, Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said the vice president &#8220;was not aware of the meeting,&#8221; adding Pence was &#8220;not focused on stories about the campaign especially those pertaining to the time before he joined the campaign.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Pence was named Trump&#8217;s running mate in the middle of July 2016, several weeks after the meeting involving the president&#8217;s son.<\/p>\n<p>Trump Jr, who is running the family business with his brother, huddled with friends and close business associates after the first stories dropped, his mood shifting from worry to defiance over the story&#8217;s lifespan, according to confidants. He has told those close to him that while he realizes the optics of the meeting aren&#8217;t ideal, he has echoed his father in believing that the media have overblown the matter and, despite some opposition among his allies, has said he wants to publicly fight back.<\/p>\n<p>But White House aides struggled with bringing forth a strong defense against the scandal that also touched Jared Kushner, the president&#8217;s son-in-law and senior adviser who attended the 2016 meeting. Though Sanders called charges of collusion &#8220;ridiculous,&#8221; the White House press briefing remained off-camera for the second consecutive day, limiting the power of her pushback.<\/p>\n<p>And the president himself was slated to stay out of sight. He had no public events scheduled for Wednesday until he leaves for another overseas trip, this time to France.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

Those investors had already lost money on their investment as of Monday when Snap&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/snapchat-snap-stock-ipo-lock-up\/\">stock dipped below its $17 IPO price<\/a> for the first time ever.<\/p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley&#8217;s downgrade is a particularly hard hit for the company as the bank was the lead underwriter for Snap&#8217;s IPO, guiding the company through the process and helping determine its initial stock price. Typically, such underwriters become cheerleaders of the company after it officially goes public, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/06\/snapchat-wall-street-analysts-say-sell\/\">authoring &#8220;buy&#8221; or &#8220;hold&#8221; recommendations<\/a>. And Morgan Stanley was no exception.<\/p>\n<p>Following <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/27\/snap-stock-snapchat-wall-street-target\/\">Snap&#8217;s IPO<\/a>, Morgan Stanley gave Snap <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"snap\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/snap\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">snap<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> the equivalent of a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating and a 12-month target price of $28\u2014one of the most bullish on Wall Street at the time.<\/p>\n<p>But now, the bank has lowered its price target by 43% to $16 a share. That&#8217;s well below <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/15\/snapchat-stock-price-time\/\">Snap&#8217;s IPO price<\/a>. (By Tuesday afternoon, Snap stock had already fallen below Morgan Stanley&#8217;s target.)<\/p>\n<p>So why the change of heart? According to the note, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak are now less convinced of Snap&#8217;s ability to grow. In fact, the analysts effectively refuted the main reasons why Snap&#8217;s biggest champions believed in the company at all: its apparent scalability and unique platform.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We have been wrong about Snap&#8217;s ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year (improving scalability, targeting, measurability, etc.) and user monetization,&#8221; Nowak wrote. &#8220;Snap&#8217;s ad product is not evolving\/improving as quickly as we expected and Instagram competition is increasing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Recently, Snap investors have grown increasingly wary of Facebook-owned <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/06\/instagram-stories-video-photos\/\">Instagram<\/a>. In late June, Facebook announced that its Instagram Stories feature, which competes with Snapchat, had reached <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/20\/snap-stock-instagram-stories\/\"> 250 million daily active users<\/a>\u201450% higher than the 166 million daily active user base Snap reported in May.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We believe Instagram has become more aggressive in competing for Snap&#8217;s ad dollars,&#8221; Nowak wrote.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, Morgan Stanley expects Snap to reach revenue of $897 million this year\u2014far lower than the $1 billion it once expected. Moreover, Morgan Stanley expects the company to reach just 182 million active users by the end of this year.<\/p>\n<p>The Morgan Stanley note also comes just a day after another of Snap&#8217;s IPO underwriters, Credit Suisse, lowered its target price on the company from $30 to $25, saying that <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/20\/snap-stock-instagram-stories\/\">Snap&#8217;s stock price<\/a> could fall later this month when Snap&#8217;s lockup period begin to expire. That will allow many of Snap&#8217;s IPO backers and insiders to start selling their shares in the company.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Snap has a chance to wow investors with stronger earnings figures. It&#8217;s possible the company is working behind closed doors on a project that could potentially unlock growth.

Even Snap&#8217;s bullish supporters are getting jittery about a potential stock plunge if those IPO shareholders decide to sell the first chance they get. Some insiders and pre-IPO investors will also be eligible to sell their stakes on that date, and some of them could theoretically sell at a profit even if Snap share prices stay below the IPO price.<\/p>\n<p>Credit Suisse, which has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Snap stock, slashed its target price from $30 to $25 Monday morning, noting that as many as 711 million shares\u2014or about 60% of all Snap stock\u2014could be sold when the lock-up expires.<\/p>\n<p>There are also doubts about Snapchat&#8217;s ability to grow and attract advertising dollars as fast as investors had hoped. &#8220;While we were hoping for Snap to exhibit a more comfortable growth path, we are reminded that nascent companies sometimes grow in fits and starts,&#8221; Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note explaining the target price cut.<\/p>\n<p>Due to a delayed rollout of a new platform designed to make it easier to buy ads on Snapchat, Ju also lowered his expectations for how much Snap made in revenue last quarter, which the company will disclose when it next reports earnings later this summer.<\/p>\n<p>Credit Suisse, along with Wall Street as a whole, no longer believes Snap will reach $1 billion in sales this year\u2014a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/30\/snapchat-snap-stock-profit-amazon-tesla-twitter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">goal once considered key<\/a> in justifying Snap&#8217;s lofty valuation. Though the company has yet to make a profit, Snap stock trades at more than 20 times estimated 2017 sales; by that measure, it&#8217;s nearly twice as expensive as Facebook stock.<\/p>\n<p>That also sets Snap investors up for disappointment if Snapchat fails to live up to their hopes, as illustrated by their reactions to the company&#8217;s first public earnings report in May. When those results missed analysts&#8217; expectations by a long shot, Snap stock <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/11\/snapchat-snap-evan-spiegel-facebook-mark-zuckerberg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plummeted 25%<\/a> in a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Some investors who bought Snap stock since its IPO, but who were not bound by the lock-up period, have already decided to bail: A couple of Fidelity mutual funds, including the Fidelity Flex Large Cap Growth fund, which maintained a small position in Snap, sold almost half their shares in May.<\/p>\n<p>As the lock-up expiration date approaches, other owners of Snap stock may wish to follow suit.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 10, 2017","published":"2017-07-10 07:39:16","updated":"2017-07-10

In Tuesday&#8217;s conference call, Uber reportedly told investors that losses would narrow further, but didn&#8217;t say by how much.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Read more:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/02\/19\/uber-susan-fowler-sexual-harassment\/\"><em>Uber Is Launching an Investigation After a Former Employee Wrote About Sexual Harassment at the Company<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In an emailed statement to <em>Bloomberg<\/em>, an Uber spokesman said, \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to have a healthy and growing business, giving us the room to make the changes we know are needed on management and accountability, our culture and organization, and our relationship with drivers.\u201d The statement did not include financials or plans for the Waymo suit.<\/p>\n<p>An emailed statement from Waymo made no mention of a settlement either. \u201cWe believe we have strong evidence to put in front of a jury about Uber\u2019s misappropriation of Waymo\u2019s trade secrets and look forward to trial,\u201d it said.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em>For more on Uber, watch Fortune&#8217;s video:<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"32\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5478989294001-32\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5478989294001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2uhrLfc\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Duber%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Duber&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p>According to <em>Bloomberg<\/em>, one of the ways in which Uber is attempting to mitigate its considerable deficit is by hiking booking fees in the U.S. and Canada.

Gabalda\u2014AFP\/Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Singapore Airlines is named the top international airline in the world for the 21st year by Travel+Leisure. The airline is the flag carrier of Singapore with its hub at the Singapore Changi Airport and flies to 62 destinations in 32 countries on five continents. The airline was the first customer for the Airbus A380, the world\u2019s largest passenger aircraft. In October of 2015, the airline announced it will resume the world\u2019s longest non-stop flight from Singapore to Newark which was launched in 2013. This was the longest flight ever recorded at 18 hours each way. The flight\u2019s cabins include suites, first class, business class, premium economy, and economy. Singapore Airline&#8217;s suites are known to be incredibly luxurious and were designed by the French luxury yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste, and can only be found on the A380 planes. The airline is known to be the first and only commercial airline to offer double beds in its aircraft. But passengers say the best part of the flights isn&#8217;t the features but the service. The airline has strict standards for their men and women crew which involves a 15-week training program &#8211; longer than the industry standard.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Emirates<\/li>\n<li>Qatar<\/li>\n<li>Cathay<\/li>\n<li>Japan Airlines<\/li>\n<li>Virgin Atlantic<\/li>\n<li>Air New Zealand<\/li>\n<li>Korean Air<\/li>\n<li>All Nippon Airways<\/li>\n<li>Eva Air<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 01:42:05","updated":"2017-07-11 01:42:05","minute":"1:42 PM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":true},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/this-is-the-best-airline-in-the-world\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/this-is-the-best-airline-in-the-world\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/this-is-the-best-airline-in-the-world\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"35\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5502366486001-35\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5502366486001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2v8xQH5\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/travel_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbestairlineintheworld%2Csingaporeairline%2Cworldsbestairline%2Cworldsworstairline%2Cworstairlineintheworld%26ch%3Dtravel%26topic%3Dbestairlineintheworld&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>Singapore Airlines tops the charts &#8211; maintaining their 21-year streak. <\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"2046289","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/krishna-thakker\/","name":"Krishna Thakker","twitter":"","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":false,"thumbnail_alt":false,"thumbnail_src":false,"bio":"","title":"","company":"","is_contributor":"not-contributor"}],"sections":[{"term_id":1875350,"name":"Executive Travel","slug":"executive-travel","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":129962,"taxonomy":"category","description":"News and advice to help globe-trotting executives travel smarter.

Users need only to link their PayPal accounts to their Apple ID accounts to make payments through the services. However, PayPal access is currently only available to customers in Mexico and Canada. Those living in the U.S. and other countries will have PayPal access &#8220;soon,&#8221; the digital payment company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/stories\/us\/paypal-now-available-on-app-store-apple-music-itunes-more\">said<\/a> in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>PayPal has long been one of the more popular digital-payment platforms, allowing users to create online accounts to place purchases across the Web. PayPal users link credit or debit cards to their accounts. When buying products online, users can opt to checkout with PayPal credentials instead of sharing their credit card numbers with the merchant. PayPal argues it adds a layer of security users wouldn&#8217;t get by inputting credit card information.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s technology newsletter<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AAPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AAPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> decision to support PayPal <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"PYPL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/paypal-holdings\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">PYPL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> marks a stark departure for the company. Since the App Store&#8217;s inception in 2008, Apple has maintained strict control over payment options, and has not allowed third-party payment services to be used to acquire its digital goods.<\/p>\n<p>Now with this move, Apple is relinquishing some of that control. Instead of inputting credit card information or using the iPhone maker&#8217;s mobile-payment service Apple Pay, customers can link their PayPal accounts and stay away from Apple&#8217;s options. And once PayPal is selected as a payment method, it&#8217;ll automatically be used on all future purchases, so users won&#8217;t need to input their PayPal information with each transaction.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that Apple isn&#8217;t removing its existing payment options, so users can still opt to buy apps and music with a credit card, Apple Pay, or gift card.<\/p>\n<p>Neither Apple nor PayPal announced the terms of the new arrangement. However, PayPal shareholders seem pleased: the digital payment company&#8217;s shares are up nearly 4% as of this writing, and earlier on Wednesday hit a 52-week high of $56.99.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12 11:11:34","updated":"2017-07-12 11:11:34","minute":"11:11 AM

United States is healthy enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow wind down of the massive bond portfolio accumulated by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, Fed Chair Janet<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>said in prepared testimony to be delivered to Congress Wednesday morning.<\/p>\n<p>In what may be one of her last appearances on Capitol Hill,<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment, and was now being supported as well by stronger economic conditions abroad.<\/p>\n<p>The Fed &#8220;continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time,&#8221;<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>said, while reductions in the Fed&#8217;s more than $4 trillion in securities are likely to begin &#8220;this year.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">Yellen <\/span>will present her latest economic summary to the House Committee on Financial Services at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), after which committee members will question her. Her appearances before the House panel have sometimes involved sharp exchanges with lawmakers who think the Fed&#8217;s influence over the economy has grown too large, and who want policymakers to be guided more closely by a mathematical rule for setting interest rates.<\/p>\n<p>In a report released last week the Fed compared its current policy to that prescribed by a variety of such rules \u2014 pointing out that the choice of a rule itself involved judgments that would lead to vastly different outcomes.<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>referred House lawmakers specifically to that section of the report in her testimony.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">Yellen<\/span>&#8216;s appearance comes as the Trump administration mulls whether to replace her when her term ends in February.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. stock index futures rose on her remarks while yields on Treasuries fell and the dollar declined against a basket of currencies.<\/p>\n<p>By her testimony today, the economy is currently on an even keel, near or beyond full employment and the Fed is steadily moving rates higher. The reduction in the balance sheet, which will begin slowly as the Fed reinvests only a portion of the holdings that mature each month, will mark the final exit from crisis-related policies.<\/p>\n<p>One potential issue: the Fed wants to keep policy accommodative to continue supporting the recovery, but may be approaching a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rate faster than expected. Estimates of the inflation-adjusted neutral rate have been falling, and by some accounts may be near zero.<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>has said the Fed expects estimates of the neutral rate to rise over time. But unless that happens, or inflation picks up, the Fed may only have a few rate increases left before it hits a level that is no longer felt to be encouraging spending and investment.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"highlight\">Yellen <\/span>said in her testimony that as it stands rates &#8220;would not have to rise all that much further&#8221; to reach neutral.<\/p>\n<p>Though a recent dip in inflation has been of concern among Fed officials who want to see surer progress toward the central bank&#8217;s 2 percent inflation goal,<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>ascribed it to &#8220;a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices&#8221; that would eventually drop out of the calculation.<\/p>\n<p>The current situation &#8220;raises the stakes&#8221; for upcoming inflation data, said Jim Vogel, interest rate strategist for FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. &#8220;People are going to be very anxious if that was just a statistical glitch&#8230;or if it is going to continue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise,<span class=\"highlight\"> Yellen <\/span>said, the economy appeared to be in a virtuous loop of hiring, spending and investment that &#8220;should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

Revenue Service is significantly scaling back an investigation into customers who bought and sold bitcoins on the popular digital currency exchange Coinbase.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of asking Coinbase for a long list of details about its customers who bought or sold bitcoin between 2013 and 2015, the IRS told a federal court it is now seeking information only for those accounts that engaged in transactions worth $20,000 or more.<\/p>\n<p>The news will come as a relief to thousands of people who dabbled in bitcoin but faced the prospect of a tax investigation for failing to disclose they sold a small amount of the currency, or used it to purchase goods and services. The IRS launched the investigation in part because the price of bitcoin soared from $13 to over $1,100 during the years in question, and because <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/19\/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit\/\">only 802<\/a> people reported their bitcoin gains or losses in 2015 to the agency.<\/p>\n<p>An IRS spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation&#8217;s new scope, which is limited\u2014in the agency&#8217;s words\u2014to users with &#8220;at least the equivalent of $20,000 in any one transaction type (buy, sell, send, or receive) in any one year during the 2013-15 period.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The modified request, first reported by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/20000-irs-exempt-casual-bitcoin-buyers-coinbase-data-request\/\">CoinDesk<\/a>, was set out in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/353433981\/Narrowed-Summons\">a court filing <\/a>titled &#8220;Notice of Narrowed Summons Request for Enforcement.&#8221; The filing also announced the IRS is limiting the scope of its request for the accounts. (You can see full details of those new limits below).<\/p>\n<p>The news comes as the IRS is locked in a closely-watched <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/15\/coinbase-irs\/\">court fight<\/a> with anonymous Coinbase users who want to a judge to block a summons the agency served on the company last year.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em>Fortune<em>\u2019s<\/em><em> technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If Coinbase had complied with the original summons, it would have forced it to turn over personal details related to over a million accounts, and over 500,000 active customer accounts. The scope of the summons caused an outcry among digital currency owners, and led senior members of Congress to send a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/21\/irs-bitcoin-congress\/\">sharply worded letter<\/a> to the IRS that warned its probe was &#8220;overly broad&#8221; and extremely burdensome.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps in response to this pressure, a lawyer for the IRS told a judge last week that the agency would no longer seek password and security settings for the accounts.<\/p>\n<p>The big question now is whether the concessions by the IRS will lead the anonymous Coinbase customers to withdraw their lawsuit, or whether they will push the court to limit the summons still further. Lawyers at the Los Angeles law firm Berns Weiss, which are representing the customers, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<p>Coinbase itself is not part of the lawsuit, but it has said it would join in if the IRS failed to limit the scope of the summons.<\/p>\n<p>A spokesperson for the San Francisco-based company declined to comment on the agency&#8217;s decision to only seek information on the larger accounts, and referred <em>Fortune<\/em> to a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.coinbase.com\/coinbase-irs-update-8f3af2c18eb1\">blog post<\/a> from March.<\/p>\n<p>The IRS move did not appear to affect the price of bitcoin, which was trading <a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.wordpress.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2086703&amp;action=edit\">around $2,400<\/a> on Monday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, here are the other changes the IRS made to its request. The bold phrases are my summary of the changes, while the indented text is taken from the original summons followed by the limits set out in the July 6 court filing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Change 1: Eliminates request for payment information and security settings. <\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>ORIGINAL REQUEST: Account\/wallet\/vault registration records for each account\/wallet\/vault owned or

Of course, the culprit is Amazon-Whole Foods. Cerberus Capital Management acquired Albertsons in 2006 and planned to take it public in 2015. Those plans stalled after a disappointing profit forecast from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wal-Mart<\/a> spooked the markets. Albertsons renewed its IPO plans earlier this year. Meanwhile Albertsons attempted to buy Whole Foods but was \u201cspurned.\u201d Now the IPO plans are<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-07-11\/albertsons-is-said-to-stall-renewed-ipo-plans-amid-amazon-deal\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">on ice again<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">To convince potential investors of its growth prospects in its 2015 IPO roadshow, Albertsons pitched plans to expand its natural and organic foods offerings. Now, the looming Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up squelches confidence in those hopes.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">BEZOS!!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">But I\u2019m not sure I understand the kneejerk dread over the certain, unstoppable path of destruction expected by Amazon-Whole Foods. Is all the gloom because Whole Foods struggled as a public company, therefore all public grocery stories are doomed? Or are we bearish because Amazon is now armed with a chain of physical grocery stores, and therefore all competitors are automatically, without a doubt doomed? And also: Is every story about the grocery industry <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">required<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> to include apocalyptic quotes from experts like, \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-07-11\/albertsons-is-said-to-stall-renewed-ipo-plans-amid-amazon-deal\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">They don\u2019t have a shot. Traditional grocery is fading fast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Whatever effect Amazon-Whole Foods has on the grocery industry, it won\u2019t happen overnight. Even combined, Amazon and Whole Foods are barely a blip on the overall food market in the U.S. As Jefferies points out in its analyst note on the deal: Whole Foods owns just 1.7% of the U.S. grocery market. Amazon owns 0.8%. By comparison, Wal-Mart has around 18% and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/kroger\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kroger<\/a> is just under 10%.

In many parts of the country, there just aren&#8217;t enough health professionals to deal with a glut of patients who need care. But, in an increasingly digital world, one solution to this shortage could involve opening up the health care job market with a gig economy-style staffing system\u2014including to nurses.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the approach that Nomad Health, a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/01\/ted-talk-digital-health-raj-panjabi\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">digital health<\/a> upstart which describes itself as an &#8220;Airbnb&#8221; system for medical staffing, is taking. The company is sort of an offshoot of telemedicine\u2014just one that&#8217;s more focused on the employer, rather than consumer, side.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getbrainstormhealth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Click here<\/em><\/a> <em>to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/04\/20\/digital-health-revolution\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">already has<\/a> a system in place to match doctors from certain specialties (including internal and emergency medicine) who are looking for freelance work with hospitals that need the extra manpower. Nomad even takes care of the back-end insurance paperwork. Now, it&#8217;s expanding its platform to include certified nurses throughout the country who are seeking short-term positions with participating Texas hospitals. The eventual plan is to roll out the system nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The nursing shortage is a major factor when it comes to barriers to accessing care,&#8221; Nomad co-founder and CEO Dr. Alexi Nazem told <em>Fortune <\/em>in an interview.<\/p>\n<p>The numbers seem to line up with Nazem&#8217;s assessment. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) <a href=\"https:\/\/news.aamc.org\/for-the-media\/article\/gme-funding-doctor-shortage\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">projects<\/a> a physician shortage, relative to America&#8217;s population and medical needs, of 40,800-104,900 by the year 2030 (in part driven by a lack of funding for more continuing medical education and residency programs, according to the AAMC). The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) has pointed out <a href=\"http:\/\/www.aacn.nche.edu\/media-relations\/fact-sheets\/nursing-shortage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">similarly troubling trends<\/a> such as an aging nurse workforce and shortfall against expected demand.<\/p>\n<p>One digital solution likely isn&#8217;t enough to overcome these major systemic issues (that would also require regulatory and legislative changes).

Over the past few years, a number of startups have been trying to upend parts of this market, including Dollar Shave Club and The Honest Company.<\/p>\n<p>A new entrant is debuting Wednesday, called Brandless, with backing from a number of well-known Silicon Valley investors, <em>Fortune<\/em> has learned exclusively.<\/p>\n<p>Founded by Sherpa Capital investor Tina Sharkey and serial entrepreneur Ido Leffler, Brandless is pegged as a new marketplace for everything from toothpaste to olive oil. It just announced $16 million in funding led by Redpoint Ventures with Cowboy Ventures, Slow Capital, and Sherpa Capital all participating.<\/p>\n<p>According to its founders, Brandless owns, creates, and sells all of its own products. All food and items sold on Brandless are touted to be either natural and\/or organic, and the site promises simplicity in choice of items. For example, Brandless might sell one type of olive oil instead of five.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Consumers want new options,&#8221; says Leffler. &#8220;They don&#8217;t necessarily care about buying Heinz or Tide.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Every item that is sold on Brandless is the same price, which the company did not disclose but said it was in the single digits. Items don&#8217;t have a particular brand, and are identified by exactly what they are (i.e. toilet paper). There is an <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">AMZN<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> Prime-like membership fee, also not disclosed, but shoppers don&#8217;t need to be members in order to buy from the site. The membership will provide shipping benefits and discounts to outside services.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Although Leffler and Sharkey say that they are not trying to compete with Amazon, the e-commerce giant that makes billions each year from selling everything from Charmin toilet paper to Pampers diapers, inevitably the startup will compete with the Seattle-company. Others have tried to go head to head with Amazon in the past few years. Marc Lore, who previously founded Amazon-acquired Diapers.com, debuted Jet.com in 2015 to take on Amazon, and raised hundreds of millions from investors. Lore sold Jet.com to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/walmart\/\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart<\/a> earlier in 2016 for $3.3 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Brandless, which currently employs around 12 people, including former <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/target\/\" target=\"_blank\">Target<\/a> executives. Sharkey will leave her role as an investor at Sherpa Capital at the end of this year, and will be the full-time CEO of the company, with Leffler joining as chairman.<\/p>\n<p>Investors like Redpoint&#8217;s Jeff Brody, who has backed vacation home rental marketplace HomeAway and and expense giant Concur, says that he was convinced by Sharkey and Leffler within five minutes of hearing their first pitch. &#8220;They mapped out the future of the CPG industry and deconstructed it in way that I realized the opportunity there was to create a new brand and category,&#8221; says Brody. &#8220;The vision is massive and these are the right people to execute it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"45\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5236664168001-45\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5236664168001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2gZrTpB\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Camazonbookstore%2Camazonbrickandmortar%2Camazongo%2Candrewnusca%2Cjeffbezos%2Croberthackett%2Ctechdebate%2Cwalmart%2Cwalmart%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The majority of new consumers, including millennials, say that they don&#8217;t want to buy the same products that their parents use,&#8221; explains Sharkey. But at the same time, these consumers want authenticity and quality, she adds. That&#8217;s paved the way for companies like Dollar Shave Club, which was just acquired by <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/07\/19\/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-for-1-billion\/\">Unilever for $1 billion.<\/a> Unilever <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"UL\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"\/company\/ul\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">UL<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> also just <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/09\/20\/seventh-generation-unilever-deal\/\">bought<\/a> sustainable household goods company Seventh Generation.<\/p>\n<p>Many large corporations selling consumer-focused products add extra costs to the price of items, making them more expensive then they need to be, according to critics. Sharkey and Leffler refer to this as the &#8220;brand tax,&#8221; which they say isn&#8217;t added to the items they are selling.<\/p>\n<p>Although Brandless is not marking up items with this &#8220;brand tax,&#8221; the company claims that it will still be able to make money from each product sold. But these margins will be taken at a much &#8220;fairer price,&#8221; says Leffler, than other outlets.<\/p>\n<p>Brandless will launch in the spring of 2017 with the ability to ship in the U.S. from distribution centers and warehouses in the Midwest as well as on the East and West coasts.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"December 7, 2016","published":"2016-12-07 12:00:24","updated":"2016-12-07

technology.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of the venture fund, called <a href=\"https:\/\/gradient.google\/\">Gradient Ventures<\/a>, is to help early stage startups overcome engineering challenges and ultimately create products that use AI to solve modern-day challenges, Google said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/topics\/machine-learning\/introducing-gradient-ventures\/\">blog post<\/a> Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>The fund has already invested in four startups, including Algorithmia, Cogniac, Cape, and Aurima. Google didn&#8217;t provide details about the size of the fund or how much it invested in any of the companies in its portfolio. The fund will provide capital, access to experts, and training.<\/p>\n<p>Gradient is staffed by a number of engineers, the idea being that they can offer the kind of expertise and troubleshooting that founders AI startups may need. The venture fund was founded and is managed by Anna Patterson[f500link ignore=true], who most recently was Google\u2019s vice president of engineering in AI, a position in which she helped integrate AI into products across the company.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;AI-focused venture funds are all the rage these days.

Bursts","content":"<p class=\"p1\">An imminent economic crisis the likes of which this generation has never experienced is coming. However, the conditions under which the next bubble will burst will surprise even the most astute observers of economy, culture, and politics. The higher education bubble (one-sixth of the U.S. economy) will likely burst with the force of all previous catastrophes combined\u2014a shock wave so sudden, so large, that it gathers the full force of the savings and loan, insurance, energy, tech, and mortgage crashes, creating a blockbuster-level perfect storm.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Disturbing patterns of unsustainable economic activity have emerged over the last decade. College and university budgets rely on inflated real estate investment, deny the short- and long-term effects of student loan defaults, accept the rise in tuition above the rate of inflation as normal, and expect a downsized part-time faculty to help subsidize inflated tenure track and endowed tenure budgetary lines. The insatiable upper administrative appetite for high salaries, job description absurdity, and low accountability adds endless layers of compulsive, prideful incompetence to an already unstable education business model that believes it simply cannot crash.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While higher education is not a business in the same way for-profit corporations are, a business plan rooted in reality remains essential to its success. Reality, however, seems an ongoing elusive concept to college administrators. Dormitories and sports facilities are funded regardless of flat enrollment rates. The mission of imparting knowledge to students (the service for which parents and students pay dearly) is shunted off to ill-paid adjunct faculty with no skin in the game. Students poorly equipped for real-world opportunities are unable to repay student loans, let alone become alumni willing and able to support their alma mater. How long until higher education\u2019s customer base realizes the expense is no longer worth it?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Without dramatic and immediate changes in the higher education sector, broader economies that support third-tier learning will fail along with it: People in the community employed by the college will lose their jobs; commercial activity geared toward the student population will fail; and investment in real estate for student housing will no longer have its expected return.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We call for a return to the teaching and innovation mission of the American university. We need a well-educated, resilient, adaptable, and entrepreneurial graduate to meet the needs of a new \u201cgig\u201d economy, which includes coding, plumbing, elder care, sociology, food service, and hotel management. We demand higher educators meet the market and personal demands of the new student body.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And while the teaching model will necessarily be heavily invested in digital knowledge, we must look to a very old style of teaching. The system of tenured professors more interested in research than in imparting knowledge, buttressed by overworked and precariously employed adjunct faculty, does nothing to stabilize a higher education community. An apprentice\/mentor system grounded in a proficiency model charged with technical, academic, and professional skill development and critical thinking objectives will revolutionize higher education.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We want our colleagues to focus on imparting the empathy that comes from interaction with other people, cultures, works of literature, and art, as well as the concrete and necessary skills for success in the post-college world of production, innovation, and hands-on work. We can deliver this high level of education while modeling what it means to have a true plan for paying for what is necessary. What better lesson could the American college graduate take with them into the working world?<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><i>Jim Rogers is an American businessman, investor, traveler, financial commentator, and author.

Every workday provides fresh opportunities for doing deals, resolving disputes, and managing conflict. But good intentions and great ideas aren&#8217;t enough. People with opposing views or entrenched positions can bring the necessary give-and-take to a halt, even when both sides propose valid arguments.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five ways to keep negotiations productive, even when dealing with the toughest of situations:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Establish process first<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Effective dealmakers establish a clear process <em>before<\/em> negotiations begin in order to avoid costly delays and unhelpful surprises. For example, you might think you&#8217;ve just closed a brilliant deal, but you then hear, &#8220;Great. Now just let me check with my boss.&#8221; Before negotiations begin, ask the right questions: Who are the key players and decision makers? What is a realistic timeline for signing the deal? What might speed things up or slow things down? How do both sides measure progress?<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Set expectations<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A CEO in South Asia once told me that he never does deals with anyone from the U.S. unless they are willing to fly into his city and drive from the airport to his manufacturing facilities\u2014a distance of less than 20 kilometers that takes almost three hours to travel. Why? &#8220;Unless they&#8217;ve experienced that, they don&#8217;t know how things work here. The first time something goes wrong, they assume we are incompetent or stealing from them,&#8221; he says. Effective negotiators are careful not to over-promise, and set appropriate expectations to ensure that delays and other disruptions do not unnecessarily derail the process or sour the relationship.<\/p>\n<p><em>See also: <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/05\/14\/xero-negotiations-skills-success\/\" target=\"_blank\">This Is the Secret to a Successful Negotiation<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Ignore ultimatums<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Phrases such as &#8220;we will never&#8221; and &#8220;take it or leave it&#8221; often get tossed around in negotiations, especially as emotions heighten. Many ultimatums are not true deal breakers. Often, they are triggered by the other side&#8217;s desire to assert control, gain tactical advantage, or vent frustration. If you give such statements too much attention and importance, it will be hard for the other side to back down without losing face. Ignoring the ultimatum makes it easier for them to be flexible.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Ask &#8220;why?&#8221;\u2014not &#8220;what?&#8221;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get entrenched on &#8220;what&#8221; each side wants. The <em>demands<\/em> each side is making might be incompatible. Shifting the question from &#8220;what&#8221; to &#8220;why&#8221; helps focus on underlying <em>interests<\/em>, which are more likely to be reconcilable. For example, if one side is demanding more time and the other is unwilling to delay closing, understanding the underlying reasons for more time (such as a lack of liquidity, not a desire to shop the deal around) might lead to agreement on an extension.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"48\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-4887350446001-48\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4887350446001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/1NxgbBb\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dblueapron%2Cblueapronceo%2Cblueaproncooking%2Cblueaprondelivery%2Cmattsalzberg%2Conleading%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Donleading&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Stay flexible<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The more currencies you accept, the more likely you are to get paid. Sometimes people say &#8220;no&#8221; or seem inflexible because their hands are truly tied. Instead of insisting on one proposal, consider presenting multiple offers. This signals adaptability and reduces the likelihood that legitimate constraints will lead to an impasse.

The program is aimed at making the workplace more women-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>The company has also launched a petition urging India&#8217;s ministry of HR development and the ministry of women and child development to establish a similar policy. &#8220;We, the women at Culture Machine, have the privilege, if we may call it that, to apply for a leave on the day when the discomfort is unmanageable, no questions asked,&#8221; the petition says. &#8220;Now, we want the rest of the women in India to have the same right.&#8221; At last count, the petition had garnered some 25,500 signatures.<\/p>\n<p>Other countries have considered measures like Culture Machine&#8217;s. In March, Italy&#8217;s parliament weighed giving women an official menstrual leave. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/28\/italy-menstrual-period-leave\/\">An argument I made against that proposal<\/a> is also relevant in this case:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4\">By all means, let\u2019s eliminate the taboo surrounding menstruation in the workplace and in society at large. The stigma is a matter of life and death in some cultures, where menstruating women are still banished from communities, with<a href=\"https:\/\/lens.blogs.nytimes.com\/2017\/01\/05\/in-nepal-monthly-exile-for-women\/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sometimes fatal results<\/a>.

&#8220;This is the president&#8217;s namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the president&#8217;s son.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind that every person in the White House has some level of concern about this. Otherwise it&#8217;s malpractice,&#8221; the adviser said.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russia&#8217;s meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president&#8217;s agenda.<\/p>\n<p>The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/angela-merkel-ivanka-trump-g20\/\">trip<\/a> to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/08\/trump-putin-russia-election-interference\/\">meeting<\/a> with Russian President Vladimir Putin.<\/p>\n<p>On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies.<\/p>\n<p>Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He knows that he didn&#8217;t do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesn&#8217;t like it when things get in the way,&#8221; a senior White House official said.<\/p>\n<p>The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his &#8220;high-quality person&#8221; who showed &#8220;transparency&#8221; by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, it&#8217;s still not a smoking gun,&#8221; said one former campaign adviser.<\/p>\n<p>Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events.<\/p>\n<p>Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote <a href=\"http:\/\/quinhillyer.com\/trump-should-resign\/\">in a blog post<\/a> that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. &#8220;The American people absolutely cannot trust Trump\u2019s objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions,&#8221; Hillyer wrote. &#8220;This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case &#8220;unfortunately supports the narrative&#8221; advanced by Trump&#8217;s Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic,&#8221; the adviser said. &#8220;A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 12, 2017","published":"2017-07-12

Week","content":"<p>Do you drink multiple cups of coffee a day?<\/p>\n<p>If you do, two new, large studies suggest that you are more likely to live longer than those who don\u2019t. Together, the studies\u2014both published in the <em>Annals of Internal Medicine\u2014<\/em>tracked more than 700,000 participants for an average of around 16 years. Results were consistent: coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of early death, particularly from heart and gut disease.<\/p>\n<p>The first study, which comprised of around 186,000 Americans, found that participants who consumed two or more cups a day were 18% less likely to die by the study\u2019s close (this was after the authors controlled for diet, exercise, smoking, among other factors). In the second study, which examined coffee consumption among more than 520,000 Europeans from 10 countries, found a similar effect: coffee drinkers were less likely to die than non-coffee drinkers.<\/p>\n<p>Before you run to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/starbucks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks<\/a>, it\u2019s important to note that correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation. Yes, coffee drinkers were associated with lower degrees of premature death than non-coffee drinkers. But coffee wasn&#8217;t necessarily the differentiating factor that reduced the risk of premature death. The study didn\u2019t control for everything\u2014<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/health-40567047\">according to the BBC<\/a>, it did not consider socio-economic status or social habits, for example. Speaking with CNN, Marc Gunter, one of the European study\u2019s authors, floated the idea that coffee drinkers are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/07\/10\/health\/coffee-leads-to-longer-life-studies-reaffirm\/index.html\">healthier to begin with<\/a>, as many people who avoid the drink do so because of existing health problems.<\/p>\n<p>Magical cure or no, the pair of studies should make coffee drinkers feel better about the habit.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy diet and lifestyle,&#8221; Veronica Wendy Setiawan, who led the European study, told CNN. &#8220;This study and the previous studies suggest that for a majority of people, there&#8217;s no long term harm from drinking coffee.&#8221;<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 03:06:02","updated":"2017-07-11 03:06:02","minute":"3:06 PM

After courts had struck down two earlier attempts to protect online openness saying the agency lacked the authority, the FCC under Obama-appointee Tom Wheeler classified Internet service providers as &#8220;common carriers&#8221; much like phone carriers. The designation, under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2016\/06\/14\/471286113\/u-s-appeals-court-holds-up-net-neutrality-rules-in-full\">satisfied the courts<\/a> but stoked fears among the companies that they could be subject to more regulation in the future, including price controls.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Saddling modern broadband infrastructure and investment decisions with heavy-handed, outdated telephone regulations creates an environment of market uncertainty that does little to advance internet openness,&#8221; AT&amp;T&#8217;s Quinn wrote in his blog post. &#8220;Instead, it jeopardizes the prospects for continued innovation and robust growth we have witnessed since the internet\u2019s creation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But net neutrality supporter Greer pointed out that the rules needed a strong legal underpinning after lawsuits by Internet service providers cut down earlier attempts.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous, and a blatant attempt to confuse the public, that they are claiming they are joining a grassroots online protest that&#8217;s explicitly intended to defend the Title II based net neutrality protections that people from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support,&#8221; Greer said.<\/p>\n<p>AT&amp;T was <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/12\/02\/fcc-verizon-att-net-neutrality\/\">under investigation<\/a> by the FCC last year for potentially violating the net neutrality rules, but Pai dismissed the probe.

But if you got that wrong, you&#8217;re not alone. Nearly two thirds of Americans can&#8217;t calculate interest payments correctly, according to a new study. About a third said they didn&#8217;t even know how.<\/p>\n<p>One of the silver linings of the financial crisis was that it was supposed to have taught many Americans a lesson, albeit painful, about the dangers of debt, and financial issues in general. Apparently, the message, though, didn&#8217;t get across.<\/p>\n<p>All told, a new study, which was released today, estimated that nearly two-thirds of Americans couldn&#8217;t pass a basic financial literacy test, meaning they got fewer than four answers correct on a five-question quiz. Worse, the percentage of those who can pass the test has fallen consistently since the financial crisis to 37% last year, from 42% in 2009.<\/p>\n<div id=\"compare-card-container\"><\/div>\n<p>These findings come from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.usfinancialcapability.org\/results.php?region=US\">National Capability Study<\/a> by the FINRA Foundation, which surveyed 27,564 Americans, from June through October of last year. FINRA is a quasi-government organization that regulates brokers and Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>Bonds presented one of the biggest problems for respondents of the survey. Just 28% knew what happens to bond prices when interest rates fall. (They rise.) And less than half of all Americans appear to be able to answer basic questions about financial risk.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond financial literacy, the study found that many Americans have recovered from the financial crisis. Respondents to the survey who reported no difficulty in covering monthly expenses and bills increased 12 percentage points, to 48% in 2015 from 36% in 2009. The percentage of respondents with emergency funds has increased to 46% from 35% in the same years. <span style=\"line-height:24px;\">Additionally, more than half of those using credit cards reported that they pay off their balance each month\u2014the highest percentage since the survey began, the study found.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>However, the study also showed <span style=\"line-height:24px;\">that even eight years after the financial crisis, significant segments of the population, including African-Americans, Hispanics, women, Millennials, and people lacking a high school education\u2014so a lot of people\u2014are still worse off then before the recession.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"56\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5027824048001-56\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5027824048001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/29y7zGS\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/finance_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Ddeutschebank%2Ceconomy%2Cfortunelive%2Crecession%2Cthefed%26ch%3Dfinance%26topic%3Dfortunelive&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>Women are more likely to put off medical services like seeing a doctor, buying prescriptions, or undergoing a medical procedure due to cost.

agree who goes first, Paris and Los Angeles will be awarded the<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/la-2024-olympic-pitch-ioc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 2024 and 2028 Olympics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>International Olympic Committee members voted unanimously to seek a consensus three-way deal between the two bid cities and the IOC executive board. Talks will open with Paris widely seen as the favorite for 2024.<\/p>\n<p>If a deal falls through, only the 2024 hosting rights will be voted on when the IOC next meets, on Sept. 13 in Lima, Peru.<\/p>\n<p>However, an agreement seemed assured by the reaction of the two mayors. Eric Garcetti of LA and Anne Hidalgo of Paris emerged on stage holding hands to welcome the decision.<\/p>\n<p>A deal is also likely because a head-to-head fight for 2024 would create a loser that is unlikely to return four years later for a new 2028 bid contest.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Both of us will find it more and more difficult to convince cities\u2014whether it&#8217;s Paris, Los Angeles or other American cities\u2014to really go into this process if one of us gets turned down,&#8221; Garcetti had said earlier Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>The mayors were united on stage by IOC President Thomas Bach, who raised an arm of each in a shared gesture of triumph.<\/p>\n<p>A deal to make both cities winners would fulfill a strategy that Bach set in motion last December to help safeguard a stable future for the signature Olympic event.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With Los Angeles and Paris, there are two fantastic cities from countries with a profound Olympic history,&#8221; Bach said.<\/p>\n<p>The IOC approved the expected double award after hearing both cities present their 2024 hosting plans at a conference center in the Olympics&#8217; capital city, Lausanne.<\/p>\n<p>Both cities used 45 minutes of videos and speeches, including one with French President Emmanuel Macron promoting the Paris cause, in a closed-door session with IOC members to explain how they would host the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/intel-sponsor-olympics-asia\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2024 Olympics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>At separate news conferences, the mayors said they could work toward a deal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We look forward to working together, maybe not in competition but collaboration with Paris,&#8221; LA&#8217;s Garcetti said after his city&#8217;s bid officials opened the campaign event.<\/p>\n<p>Garcetti and Hidalgo have long touted their good relations on other issues such as climate change.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are all at the disposition and by the side of the IOC which was right to ask itself this question,&#8221; Hidalgo said at the Paris news conference, citing her friendship with Garcetti as potentially a &#8220;key element.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Related:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/16\/mcdonalds-ioc-olympics-sponsor\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McDonald\u2019s Ends Olympic Sponsor Deal With IOC 3 Years Early<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>The dual award can give the IOC a decade of stability with two world-class cities touting financially secure bids. LA plans to use only existing venues with zero risk of white elephants. This follows years of overspending by Olympic hosts and a series of political defeats that have sunk the campaigns of potential candidates.<\/p>\n<p>It also avoids inflicting a third recent defeat on Paris\u2014which lost with bids for the 2008 and 2012 Olympics\u2014and the United States. New York and Chicago both lost heavily for 2012 and 2016, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>Those losses deepened a rift between the U.S. Olympic Committee and the Swiss-based IOC that LA 2024 and a new team of American officials have worked hard to heal.<\/p>\n<p>Paris also failed with a 1992 bid and pinned its hopes on hosting in 2024, exactly 100 years after its previous Summer Games.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We lost three times, we don&#8217;t want to lose a fourth one,&#8221; Macron said at the news conference. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to convey the message that there&#8217;s a strong unity to back this candidacy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Minutes after Macron spoke, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter: &#8220;Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.). Stay tuned!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Garcetti said the Olympic movement &#8220;can&#8217;t afford to lose the United States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The IOC&#8217;s most valuable TV rights deal is with NBC and several of its top-tier sponsors are American.<\/p>\n<p>Still, a 2028 Olympics in Southern California could be the first American-hosted games since 1996 in Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Bach has said the idea of a double award was presented to him at a lunch last year by friends whom he declined to identify in a recent interview with French sports daily <em>L&#8217;Equipe<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The LA bid team declined to comment Tuesday whether the suggestion came from its supporters, as some believe.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He (Bach) has good friends who gave him good advice,&#8221; LA bid chairman Casey Wasserman said.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11 03:12:04","updated":"2017-07-11 03:12:04","minute":"3:12 PM

change<\/a> non-profit CDP in conjunction with the Climate Accountability Institute. The report hopes to highlight the role such companies, and their investors, play in Climate Change.<\/p>\n<p>These companies, led by Saudi Aramco, Russian gas giant Gazprom, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/exxon-mobil\/\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil<\/a>, have produced about 923 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalents between 1988 to 2016. State-owned coal producers in China and India also feature in the top 10, as do Mexican oil producer Pemex and the National Iranian Oil Corporation. Of the top 10, only Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are majority-owned by private investors (although CDP has, for some reason, listed a bundle of privately-held companies into what it calls &#8220;Russia Coal&#8221; at no. 7).<\/p>\n<p>The burning of fossil fuels has increased by orders of magnitude in the last 30 years as China and India have joined the process of industrialization that the West started in the middle of the 18th century. More greenhouse gases were emitted from human activity in the last 30 years than in the previous 150, according to CDP&#8217;s research.<\/p>\n<p>Despite rapid growth in the use of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, companies and governments across the world are struggling to master the transition from fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Fossil fuel companies are also going to have to demonstrate leadership as part of this transition,&#8221; wrote Pedro Faria, technical director of the CDP. &#8220;They owe it to the millions of clients they serve that are already feeling the effects of climate change, and to the many millions more that require energy for the comfort of their daily lives but are looking for alternatives to their products.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Notably, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/31\/exxon-paris-climate-agreement-trump\/\">Exxon Mobil investors recently called for the company<\/a> to provide a future plan in case of stronger Climate Change regulations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"column small-12 medium-10 medium-offset-1 large-offset-2 text size-1x-large line-height-large _10M0Ygc4\">\u201cThis is an unprecedented victory at Exxon for

href=\"http:\/\/blog.searsholdings.com\/eddie-lampert\/transformation-update\/\">announced a new round of store closings<\/a>, this one involving 43 locations. The company framed the move as a strategic decision, one that will aid in its hoped-for return to profitability.<\/p>\n<p>The retailer, which operates the Sears department stores and Kmart discount chain, has already announced 265 closings this fiscal year. The latest paring of the fleet will leave the company with 1,140 stores, barely more than half the number of stores it operated in 2012. In this latest round of shutterings, 35 Kmart stores and eight Sears stores will close. (See list below.)<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s likely not the last of it, either. In a blog post, company CEO Eddie Lampert said more closings are coming.<\/p>\n<p>In May, Sears reported disastrous <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/25\/sears-sales\/\">first quarter results<\/a>, with comparable sales down 12.4% at Sears, and 11.2% at Kmart <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/25\/sears-sales\/\">in the first quarter. <\/a>The disappointing sales numbers weren&#8217;t new &#8212; Sears lost about $10 billion in the last six years &#8212; but there are signs the retailer is reaching a crisis point. Earlier this year, the company implemented a $1.25 billion cost-cutting plan, and acknowledged fears <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/21\/sears-bankruptcy\/\">it could very well go bankrupt.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have fought hard for many years to return unprofitable stores to a competitive position and to preserve jobs,&#8221; Lampert wrote in the blog post. &#8220;As a result, we had to absorb corresponding losses in the process. So, it is obvious that we don&#8217;t make decisions to close stores lightly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Lampert, a hedge fund manager who engineered the merger of Kmart and Sears in 2004, has long touted his work to reposition the company in response to large-scale shifts in the retail industry. (In his estimation, this means less physical space, as customers now expect more focused, edited assortments, and a focus on membership-based shopping.)<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, Sears&#8217; has moved to protect its cash pile by spinning off its best properties into a real estate investment trust, as well as subleasing and leasing store space. The rationale is that smaller, focused stores are more relevant to today&#8217;s shoppers. Sears recently opened a small store in Texas focused on mattresses and appliances, part of a new format the company is testing.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s questionable that an additional 43 stores and experimenting with new store formats will be enough to move the needle for a retailer with 1,000 locations. Indeed, Sears has closed hundreds of weak stores in the last few years, yet comparable sales &#8211; a metric that strips out the impact of newly closed or open stores- have continued to relentlessly fall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are the stores involved in the latest round of closures:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Kmart<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>104 Highway 31 North Athens AL<\/li>\n<li>635 Skyland

AlphaBay Stays Dark One Week Later","content":"<p>It&#8217;s been nearly a week since the world&#8217;s most popular website for illegal goods vanished abruptly, and now its users\u2014who collectively stand to lose millions of dollars\u2014are giving up hope it will ever return.<\/p>\n<p>The site, AlphaBay, operated for years on the so-called dark web, which can only be accessed by users who employ special software that masks their location and identity. But last Tuesday night, AlphaBay suddenly went dark and has been inaccessible ever since.<\/p>\n<p>While an administrator for the site suggested last week the outage was due to technical problems, many AlphaBay users are coming to the conclusion that its disappearance is due to an &#8220;exit scam.&#8221; This is a common hustle in which the operators of an illicit website use the pretext of a hacking incident or technical problems to abscond with customer accounts.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, <\/em><em>Fortune\u2019s<\/em> technology newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>The funds in the accounts represent customer payments, as well as money held in escrow while customers await their shipment of drugs or other illegal products like guns or counterfeit passports. The funds are typically held in the digital currency bitcoin. According to tech news site <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/7\/5\/15922348\/dark-web-alphabay-market-exit-scheme-4-million-bitcoin\">the Verge<\/a>, bitcoin transaction records show AlphaBay&#8217;s shutdown coincided with a series of sudden withdrawals of $4 million from small accounts\u2014suggesting the site owners pocketed their customers&#8217; bitcoins.<\/p>\n<p>As AlphaBay remains dark, online discussion at online message board Reddit and elsewhere reflect rage and frustration among its customers.

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/intel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Intel<\/a> unveiled its newest line of microprocessor chips for servers and cloud data centers this week and managed to impress some on Wall Street with larger-than-expected performance improvements.<\/p>\n<p>Intel says its new Xeon Scalable line <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/11\/intel-xeon-amd-nvdia-servers\/\">boost performance 65% on average<\/a> from its prior generation of chips. But the news comes as Intel faces slowing sales for server chips and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/03\/08\/intel-server-chips-amd-qualcomm\/\">fierce competition<\/a> from Advanced Micro Devices, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/nvidia\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia<\/a> and others. Data center sales rose just 6% in the first quarter, down from a 9% increase a year earlier and a 19% jump in the same quarter of 2015. The server chip slowdown and fears of increasing competition have hit Intel&#8217;s stock price, which at $34.07 on Wednesday, is down 6% so far this year.<\/p>\n<p>Some analysts didn&#8217;t even wait to hear about the new chips. Mark Lipacis at Jefferies &amp; Co <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/07\/10\/intel-downgrade-jeffries\/\">downgraded his rating on Intel to &#8220;sell&#8221; on Monday<\/a>. But Tuesday&#8217;s announcements, with many impressive benchmark results, gave plenty of ammunition to Intel&#8217;s supporters on Wall Street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sentiment on Intel, which didn&#8217;t seem like it could go any lower, falls weekly with each additional downgrade,&#8221; writes Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis, who expects Intel stock to reach $45. &#8220;We clearly have a non-consensus view that Intel is not a complete zero in the AI world and that the &#8216;tectonic shift&#8217; is more of a startling earthquake that got everyone&#8217;s attention but didn&#8217;t immediately throw California into the ocean.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><em><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/getdatasheet\/\">Get Data Sheet<\/a>, Fortune&#8217;s technology newsletter.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With more comparisons to AMD&#8217;s new Epyc chips due soon, Curtis expects the results will strongly favor Intel. &#8220;This launch and subsequent benchmarks from Intel and AMD (theirs are still embargoed) should show that Intel is still squarely ahead across the full range of tests and not just a few cherry picked ones,&#8221; he writes.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/jp-morgan-chase\/\" target=\"_blank\">J.P. Morgan<\/a> analyst Harlan Sur was also impressed by Intel&#8217;s &#8220;highest level of performance improvement in over a decade.&#8221; In combination with some other products Intel is pitching to server customers, the company &#8220;continues to set a high barrier to entry for competitors and we remain optimistic that Intel\u2019s datacenter franchise will continue to be the growth and profitability engine for the company going forward,&#8221; Sur writes.<\/p>\n<p>With those related products, like storage drives and memory chips, Intel is looking to boost revenue from datacenter customers by expanding beyond just selling microprocessor chips. A new effort called &#8220;Select Solutions&#8221; combines various products into offerings aimed at different market segments with more specialized needs.<\/p>\n<p>That got the attention of Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy.

href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/15\/audi-volvo-google-android\/\">Audi<\/a> on Wednesday <a href=\"https:\/\/www.audi-mediacenter.com\/en\/press-releases\/the-new-audi-a8-future-of-the-luxury-class-9124\">introduced the newest edition of its A8 luxury sedan<\/a>, a car the German automotive brand will propel it into the future.<\/p>\n<p>The Audi A8 features cutting-edge technology ranging from its infotainment display to its 286-and-up horsepower engine. But the star of the new vehicle is what Audi calls the &#8220;traffic jam pilot.&#8221; With a front camera along with a combination of LIDAR, radar and ultrasonic sensors, the A8 can autonomously take control of itself and drive in highway traffic up to about 37 miles per hour so long as a physical barrier separates the car from traffic in the oncoming lane.<\/p>\n<p>Audi says that a button on the A8&#8217;s center console can make the traffic jam pilot start, accelerate, steer and stop the vehicle. The automaker additionally claims that the function will allow drivers to completely remove their hands from the wheel and watch the car&#8217;s on-board television while the vehicle <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/14\/ford-argo-ai-self-driving-cars\/\">autonomously drives itself<\/a> (depending on local regulations.)<\/p>\n<p>When the A8 reaches its destination, another feature, the &#8220;remote parking pilot,&#8221; can direct the vehicle in and out of a parking spot or garage automatically. The driver doesn&#8217;t even need to be in the car \u2014 he or she can activate the system from an app on their smartphone. It&#8217;s unclear whether the route to the parking space needs to be pre-programmed, however.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"7\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:500px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n<div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n<div style=\" background:url(data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC\/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5\/P8\/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo\/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI\/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf\/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BWZoO_gBjha\/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Audi put an A8 mockup on a crane and it was sort of insane.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by Roberto Baldwin (@strngwys) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2017-07-11T08:59:30+00:00\">Jul 11, 2017 at 1:59am PDT<\/time><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Moving to the interior, the A8&#8217;s 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment display allows users to access controls for voice functions, air conditioning, traffic information and more. The system&#8217;s navigation program is self-learning and adapts based on owners&#8217; driving history and search suggestions.<\/p>\n<p>The A8&#8217;s suspension is adaptable, capable of adjusting based on road conditions and drivers&#8217; preferences. With an additional feature Audi calls &#8220;pre sense 360,&#8221; the A8&#8217;s wheels will automatically raise if it senses an imminent side collision. Audi says that can reduce the potential damage for both vehicles involved in a crash.<\/p>\n<p>This being a $100,000-plus vehicle, there&#8217;s no shortage of luxury features. The rear right seat of the A8 comes with a footrest that will warm and massage the soles of a passenger&#8217;s feet. Rear passengers also get access to ambient light control, HD Matrix reading lights and a smartphone-size OLED display to control these features without needing to bother the driver.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the A8 may face some speed bumps along the way. Its autonomous driving features are <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/13\/waymo-firefly-google-alphabet-self-driving-cars\/\">limited<\/a> in markets that restrict the use of self-driving vehicles, for instance. Audi says it will be adopting a &#8220;step-by-step approach&#8221; to introducing the traffic jam pilot following the vehicle&#8217;s launch. The vehicle&#8217;s high price tag, meanwhile, means this isn&#8217;t a car for the masses. But if its self-driving tech is as good as Audi claims, the A8 could be an important stepping stone towards fully autonomous driving.<\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"July 11, 2017","published":"2017-07-11

In 2011 he cofounded a startup, BitInstant, that became one of the biggest early cryptocurrency companies. At one point, it was processing about a third of all Bitcoin transactions, before flaming out in 2013. \u201cYou talk to 10 people,\u201d says Shrem, \u201cI guarantee you at least seven of them will say they got their first bitcoin from BitInstant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem is a natural-born impresario, a promoter\u2019s promoter, and he was one of the first public faces of the cryptocurrency phenomenon.

He has already stumbled once in his comeback, with one venture crashing almost instantly, before landing a job at Jaxx, a startup that allows users to hold separate balances of different virtual coins in digital wallets.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem embodied the chaotic, legally questionable early days of cryptocurrency. But he says he\u2019s different now. He claims he\u2019s no longer operating mainly for himself and instead wants to use his talents to strengthen the crypto-community.<\/p>\n<p>Charlie Shrem is nobody\u2019s image of a traditional financier, but that\u2019s precisely the point with alternative currencies: Their early leaders were the sorts of people who would never pass muster at, say, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/morgan-stanley\/\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley<\/a>. That may just make Shrem the perfect messenger, as digital currencies transition from an off-the-grid form of exchange favored by people who reviled any established system into something that is fast becoming an established system of its own.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The promise of bitcoin, when it came into the world in 2009, was to be a universal currency, electronic cash that could be sent around the globe in minutes and that would work as well in New Delhi as it did in New York. Its scarcity is predetermined by the code: New bitcoins are introduced into the system at regular intervals through a process called mining. The word is misleading, since this form of mining consists of solving the complex math problems necessary to confirm transactions on the network. Successfully solving the problems triggers the creation of more digital currency.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, built a decentralized system that no one would own but anyone could participate in. A constantly updated copy of the ledger recording all Bitcoin transactions\u2014the blockchain\u2014would be stored on the computer of anyone running the software. Although the ledger was open to all, Bitcoin transactions were meant to be anonymous.<\/p>\n<p>Blockchain technology is groundbreaking because it allows transactions to be processed without recourse to a central authority, such as a payments company, government, or bank. Businesses and services can be decentralized, cutting out costly middlemen and removing single points of failure.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2071463\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/btc_cryptocurrencies\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391\" data-orig-size=\"1220,466\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"btc_cryptocurrencies\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows change in prices for top cryptocurrencies&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391?w=1024\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2071463\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&#038;h=391\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=1024&amp;h=391 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=150&amp;h=57 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=300&amp;h=115 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png?w=768&amp;h=293 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/btc_cryptocurrencies.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Chart shows change in prices for top cryptocurrencies<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>But only eight years after its launch, Bitcoin is showing strain. A civil war has been raging over its future. Due to limitations in its code, the Bitcoin network can process only seven transactions a second\u2014a trifling quantity for any system that aspires to serve the masses. (Visa handles thousands of transactions per second.) As the load has increased, the time it takes to confirm transactions has risen sharply, and users have been at odds over how to solve the problem. The bickering threatens to divide the currency into two competing versions of Bitcoin\u2014or condemn it to obsolescence.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is Bitcoin slower than some of its younger rivals, it\u2019s also more limited. Yes, Bitcoin allows the transfer of value. But many of the new systems can be used for much more. <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/ethereum-blockchain-vitalik-buterin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum\u2019s creators<\/a>, for instance, have built a potentially more versatile network by incorporating a scripting language that allows developers to create \u201csmart contracts\u201d\u2014agreements written into the software that can dispense funds and perform other functions automatically in response to preset triggers.<\/p>\n<p>All of which means Bitcoin faces a threat from younger, more nimble rivals. Their names are legion: Litecoin. Zcash. Monero. Dash.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Dash\u2014a portmanteau of \u201cdigital cash\u201d\u2014is one of the biggest. It got its start in January 2014, one of many cryptocurrencies that emerged following Bitcoin\u2019s then-immense rise in price. Many of these, known as \u201caltcoins,\u201d were used exclusively as vehicles for pump-and-dump schemes. Somebody\u2014often an altcoin\u2019s creator\u2014would pick a coin to pour funds into, and hype would build. Novices would pile in, the price would spike, and the major investors would dump it, sending the price plunging downward.<\/p>\n<p>The old Charlie Shrem was not above taking advantage. He claims he turned $50 into $15,000 on one altcoin (but also got badly burned on an altcoin intended to be a national cryptocurrency for Iceland, which shed half of its value in a single day).<\/p>\n<p>Dash was one of the most popular altcoins. Originally known as Darkcoin because it promised untraceable transactions, it saw plenty of pumping and dumping. But its creator continued to refine the software and add new features. In March 2015 it rebranded as Dash, so people wouldn\u2019t mistake it for a \u201csingle-feature coin,\u201d says Ryan Taylor, who leads its core team. Gradually Dash gained legitimacy. The total value of its currency has grown at triple-digit rates every year. Part of that is due to Bitcoin\u2019s flaws. To attract customers, Taylor says, a new payment method needs to be faster, easier to use, and more secure than the alternatives. Bitcoin and most other digital currencies fail on all three metrics, he argues. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly not faster or easier to use than credit cards,\u201d says Taylor, a former financial services consultant at McKinsey.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"0.56363636363636\" data-pos=\"7\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5460479898001-7\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"550\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"310\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5460479898001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tXJS5B\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/tech_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Dbitcoin%2Cblockchain%2Ccryptocurrencies%2Cfinance%2Cico%2Cinitialcoinofferings%2Clitecoin%2Ctech%2Ctechdebate%26ch%3Dtech%26topic%3Dtechdebate&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>\n<p>Dash has functions to address those weaknesses. It offers an \u201cinstant send\u201d feature that Taylor says is \u201cas fast as using a credit card.\u201d To protect against fraud or theft, Dash\u2019s next version\u2014due out this year\u2014will include features such as \u201cmoderated transactions,\u201d in which funds are released only upon the receipt of goods or services, and \u201cvault accounts,\u201d which give their owner 24 hours to stop an impending withdrawal of funds. The goal is to create a medium of exchange that can be used for everyday commerce.<\/p>\n<p>Dash\u2019s clearest innovation, though, may be its governance system. All prospective projects must be submitted for a vote by people who hold at least 1,000 coins. The advantage of such a system, according to Olaf Carlson-Wee, the CEO of Polychain Capital, a hedge fund that invests exclusively in blockchain assets, is that it allows a decentralized network to make decisions rapidly, avoiding the sort of conflict now engulfing Bitcoin, which has little structure and no way to compel anybody to, say, adopt a new version of its software.<\/p>\n<p>As Dash took off this spring, Shrem decided to get involved. He proposed creating a prepaid debit card. You\u2019d load in, say, three Dash coins, which would then be converted into dollars (or euros or whatever). The cardholder could then use the card at any business that accepts a debit card. This could open the floodgates for hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency to enter the mainstream economy. \u201cPeople only want to hold Dash if they can easily convert it to something of use,\u201d Taylor agrees.<\/p>\n<p>There are several Dash-funded debit cards available, but Shrem\u2019s would be the first that could be used in the U.S. His plan garnered overwhelming support within the Dash universe. \u201cReputation plays an important role on the network,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cWhen someone like Charlie comes along, people take it seriously.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Charlie Shrem grew up in Sheepshead Bay, a predominantly Russian and Jewish neighborhood in deep Brooklyn. His parents are Orthodox Jews, and his father worked for a jewelry retailer, while his mother cared for Shrem and his two sisters.<\/p>\n<p>Shy and awkward, Shrem blossomed upon discovering a knack for computers. He taught himself to code and became a presence in online hacker forums. In 2009, while attending Brooklyn College, he cofounded a daily deals site for electronics called Daily Checkout. He found he loved sales.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem has claimed, with characteristic hyperbole, that he was one of the first 10 people in the world to know what Bitcoin was. That is likely exaggerated. By the fall of 2011, however, he was sufficiently established in the Bitcoin community to be credible as the CEO of a startup (albeit one he launched from his parents\u2019 basement).<\/p>\n<p>That startup, BitInstant, helped people acquire digital currency and move it between Bitcoin exchanges.

He raised $10,000 from his mom and $120,000 from an angel investor named Roger Ver. But one person who declined to invest warned him that BitInstant had no safeguards to prevent money laundering.<\/p>\n<p>That was fine with Shrem. It was fine, too, with a substantial portion of BitInstant\u2019s clientele, users of Silk Road, who needed to exchange dollars for Bitcoins in order to buy drugs on the underground market. There was even a middleman, Robert Faiella, a plumber in Florida who had a sideline obtaining Bitcoins for Silk Road users.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem soon figured out what Faiella was up to. But rather than shut him down, Shrem helped Faiella source money for drug transactions. Bit\u00adInstant\u2019s cash-processing company and Shrem\u2019s partner wanted to put a stop to it. But Shrem simply encouraged Faiella to disguise his identity with a new username and email address.<\/p>\n<p>The flow of money went on unimpeded. By the time Shrem finally cut him off, in late 2012, Faiella\u2014who later pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and was sentenced to four years in prison\u2014had laundered nearly a million dollars through BitInstant.<\/p>\n<p>The libertarian defense for Shrem\u2019s conduct\u2014which he himself has advanced at times\u2014has two parts: first, that individuals have the right to do what they want with their money and their bodies as long as they aren\u2019t harming anyone else; second, that at the time he began helping Faiella, the U.S. government hadn\u2019t determined how to classify or regulate Bitcoin. If the government hadn\u2019t even decided whether it viewed Bitcoin as money, the argument goes, how could one be laundering it?<\/p>\n<p>The Bitcoin community in those days was united in its sense of righteous mission. Because the digital currency abjured central banks and other authorities, many of its first devotees were libertarians, anarchists, and black marketeers who wanted to do business away from the government\u2019s watchful eye. They were gleeful at any sign of Bitcoin\u2019s impending triumph over the financial system, enraged by any show of incompetence or malice by the government or big banks. The free flow of capital, community members believed, is a human right.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem embraced the outlaw stance. When a payment processor, under pressure from partner banks and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/mastercard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mastercard<\/a>, cut all ties with Bitcoin companies, leaving customer funds stranded, it was BitInstant that hacked together a solution to let them withdraw their money.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>By August 2012, when I first met him, Shrem was a 22-year-old CEO, a cocky, motormouthed capitalist and proud pothead. I interviewed him and his lieutenants in an office they dubbed the Bakery because of all the marijuana-fueled bull sessions that took place there after hours. One former employee, Rachel Yankelevitz, told me, \u201cCharlie\u2019s main qualification for coworkers was if they could smoke weed or drink with him and chill together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem had swaggering ambitions. His company would soon be processing 30% of all Bitcoin transactions, and he wanted BitInstant to become \u201cthe <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> of Bitcoin,\u201d as he told me at the time.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:280px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2070322\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency-market\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376\" data-orig-size=\"1920,2581\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BIT.07.01.17.Charlie-Shrem.Vert\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376?w=223\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376?w=762\" class=\"wp-image-2070322\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&#038;h=376\" alt=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=280&amp;h=376 280w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=560&amp;h=752 560w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/bit-07-01-17-charlie-shrem-vert.jpg?w=223&amp;h=300 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Shrem has claimed, with characteristic hyperbole, that he was one of the first 10 people in the world to know what Bitcoin was.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Jeffery Salter for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>That fall, BitInstant raised $1.5 million in funding, most of it from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who had started a venture capital firm. They had become interested in digital currency, and BitInstant helped them buy their first bitcoins. The twins\u2014who later disavowed Shrem upon learning of his arrest\u2014would go on to scoop up a reported 1% of all the bitcoins in existence.<\/p>\n<p>After raising funds, BitInstant\u2019s future looked bright. Because so much of the crypto-economy depended on fast money transfers in and out of the system, Shrem\u2019s company became a barometer of the industry. During the Cypriot financial crisis in early 2013, when it appeared that the bank accounts of regular citizens would be taxed at 6.75% as a condition of a European bailout deal, Bitcoin suddenly looked like a safe haven, and its price shot up from $50 to $266\u2014a previously unimaginable high. Shrem became a millionaire almost overnight.<\/p>\n<p>Then the wheels came off. First a dispute with the investors led to the ouster of Shrem\u2019s two best friends at BitInstant. Something went out of him with their departures. He was often distracted. He\u2019d spend the night partying, then sleep in and show up late.<\/p>\n<p>The site, meanwhile, was straining under the surge in users, leading to waves of customer complaints. An upgrade to the platform became mired in technical problems and legal concerns. It became clear BitInstant had been operating without state money transmitter licenses (which, it became clear, some states would require to serve their residents), and the cost of obtaining them would be prohibitive.<\/p>\n<p>It was all too much. BitInstant shut down in July 2013. Alex Waters, the company\u2019s chief information officer, says Shrem \u201csquandered\u201d the opportunity to make BitInstant a world-beating company and \u201cscrewed over a lot of people.\u201d Customers were irate.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem himself appeared at first to have gotten away unscathed. He was living on his own and enjoying his freedom. He and his girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9e), Courtney Warner, took a vacation to Morocco, where he says he tried opium. He flew to Argentina on a mission for the Bitcoin Foundation. His life was a whirlwind of partying and dealmaking. \u201cI have to take a lot of people out to clubs, buying bottles, buying dinners,\u201d he told a reporter in late 2013. His business now was not BitInstant but himself. He began to earn speaking fees\u2014and all the while he kept talking like BitInstant was going to be rebuilt better than ever. \u201cHe was very arrogant,\u201d Warner says of her fianc\u00e9 during that time.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2014 it all caught up with him. On his way back from a speech in Amsterdam, he was arrested. He eventually pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitter, and was sentenced to two years. \u201cI screwed up,\u201d he told the judge at his sentencing. Shrem had wanted to raise the issue of whether the law he had broken was just. But his lawyers discouraged it.<\/p>\n<p>Other Bitcoiners had run afoul of the law, but Shrem was the first to serve time. This fact makes him, depending on your view, either a criminal who got his just deserts or a martyr. \u201cA lot of people say that I took the first shot for Bitcoin,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cThe first person to walk through the door always gets shot, and then everyone else can come through.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Shrem entered prison in March 2015. He had put weight on his slight 5-foot-4 frame, medicating himself with vodka in the nervous months before he was incarcer\u00adated. Now, in the minimum-security federal prison camp in Lewisburg, Pa., he detoxed and began frequenting the prison library. He found himself pondering the question of value. What made currencies\u2014of any form\u2014worth anything? As luck would have it, the prison economy provided the answer.<\/p>\n<p>The prison had its own currency, one based on protein\u2014mainly packets of mackerel in soybean oil. \u201cGood-quality protein is very hard to come by in prison,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cTuna is good, but tuna doesn\u2019t have texture. Mackerel is meaty.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Inmates serving long sentences, he says, would stockpile mackerel, using it as a store of value, like a savings account. But those pouches of mackerel expire in three years. \u201cPeople started transacting these mackerels that were expired,\u201d Shrem explains. \u201cThey called them money macks. The money mack had a value of about a dollar, whereas eating macks had a value of about $1.50. And they had exchangers. The money macks had no value\u2014except that everyone said they had value.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gradually he came to believe, as some monetary theorists do, that the acceptance of certain forms of money\u2014shells, colored beads, pieces of paper\u2014is largely a social convention, dependent upon what technologists would call their network effect.<\/p>\n<p>But it was clear that certain features could make one type of currency more suitable than another. Money macks were an ideal form of money for inmates. \u201cThey were scarce,\u201d Shrem says. \u201cThe only way you could get money mackerels was from edible mackerels that expired. And the inflation rate of edible mackerels was set. You had 500 inmates\u2014every inmate could only buy 14 mackerels every week in the commissary\u2009\u2026\u2009That\u2019s how many mackerels at any time, at maximum, could come into the system. There\u2019s no arbitrary printing of mackerels; there\u2019s no flooding of the market with this food. It\u2019s like Bitcoin. There was no Federal Reserve of mackerel that was printing whenever they wanted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin, he knew, has qualities that make it a powerful currency, store of value, and payments network. But expecting it to do more than that was asking too much, he decided. \u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s going to fail,\u201d he says. \u201cTrying to do smart contracts, and social media, and a distributed file-storage system, and all these different things on top of the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014it\u2019s like trying to have your browser do everything for you.\u201d Better to let a thousand crypto-flowers bloom, each one focusing on what it does best.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><b><\/b>Many of the hottest blockchain assets today are not digital currencies like Bitcoin or Dash, but so-called tokens, distinguished from true cryptocurrencies by their lack of a blockchain. They run instead on existing blockchains, primarily Ethereum\u2019s, and tend to be built for specific applications, such as a peer-to-peer marketplace for computation (Golem), a crowdsourced prediction market (Augur), or a blockchain-based advertising platform (Brave).<\/p>\n<p>Where digital currencies are generally \u201cmined,\u201d tokens are usually distributed in crowd sales known as initial coin offerings (ICOs). (After that, they trade on public exchanges.) These crowd sales serve both to raise funds and to give potential investors their first chance to grab a piece of whatever service is being built. Dozens of ICOs have already been launched, raising more than $230 million last year, followed by more than $450\u202fmillion just in the first half of 2017. (For more on investing in tokens, and their uncertain legal status, see \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/26\/ico-initial-coin-offering-investing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why Tech Investors Love ICOs\u2014and Lawyers Don&#8217;t<\/a>.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>The tokenization craze constitutes nothing less than \u201cthe second business model of the Internet,\u201d contends Carlson-Wee, whose hedge fund is backed by Andreessen Horowitz. Imagine if <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> had issued a token to its users, with its value deriving from the content and connections generated on the social network. Early users might have scooped up large quantities of the token at rock-bottom prices, while those who joined later, as the network\u2019s value became widely apparent, might find themselves able to afford only a few. But all of them, by holding this digital asset, would be able to participate in Facebook\u2019s growing success.<\/p>\n<p>This, of course, is not the case. The $435 billion value of Facebook is shared only among Mark Zuckerberg and other stockholders. Most other Internet platforms operate on the same principle. Their owners extract massive value from interactions between users.<\/p>\n<p>With blockchain-based systems, by contrast, \u201cthere\u2019s no longer a division between users and owners,\u201d Carlson-Wee says. The tokens are a wealth-sharing mechanism, a way that everyone from hedge funders to consumers can take positions in\u2014and place bets on\u2014the future of the Internet.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Shrem\u2019s reentry into civilian life was a two-step process. He was transferred to a halfway house in Harrisburg, Pa., in March 2016. Shrem says living not merely with embezzlers, fraudsters, and drug dealers, as he had in Lewisburg, but also with \u201cmurderers, bank robbers, child molesters\u201d was worse than prison. He cried his first night there. During this time, Shrem worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant for $8 an hour. Gainful employment was a condition of residency at the halfway house. Playing around with magical Internet money didn\u2019t qualify. \u201cThey were very specific,\u201d Shrem says.<\/p>\n<p>If being a dishwasher humbled him, it was still more humbling to realize how much the Bitcoin community had changed in his absence. Familiar landmarks were gone. When he tried to visit one of his old haunts, an online exchange where he\u2019d once speculated in altcoins, he found the site no longer existed. Even the lingo had changed.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem set about catching up on what he\u2019d missed. In prison the library had been his sanctuary: He would stay in there for hours. He says he read 137 books while incarcerated. Now he took the same approach with the blockchain industry. Marco Santori, a cryptocurrency attorney at the law firm Cooley, likens Shrem\u2019s reeducation to \u201cthat scene in<i> Austin Powers<\/i> where he\u2019s unfrozen after 40 years or whatever it is, and he just watches 40 years of history straight through to try to get his bearings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That didn\u2019t stop Shrem from stumbling out of the gate. Having seen that token sales were the new frontier, he became the chief technology officer of a startup called Intellisys Capital, which he predicted was going to revolutionize the investment world. The idea was to raise funds for a portfolio of middle-market companies\u2014and, later, blockchain startups\u2014by issuing $25 million worth of tokens in an ICO. \u201cIt seemed like a really cool idea,\u201d Shrem says.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was that their token would almost certainly be classified as a security under U.S. law. To avoid legal trouble, Intellisys decided to bar American and British citizens from participating in the sale. But the plan had drawbacks: They would have to rely on partners to vet prospective investors for them.<\/p>\n<p>Shrem became the face of the venture. He was back in pitch mode, touting Intellisys to the press and the public. He described the fund\u2019s planned first investment, a 20-year-old waste-\u00admanagement company in Michigan, as a \u201cproof of concept.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But as the date of the token sale was pushed back, from mid-January to the end of February, Shrem began to get cold feet. Selling a security could bring all kinds of scrutiny to a man already convicted of a financial crime. \u201cI still get these nightmares I\u2019m in prison sometimes,\u201d he tells me in March. He was becoming increasingly nervous.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately for him, fate intervened. The ICO, held at the end of February, was a bomb. \u201cWe had a bunch of technical problems,\u201d says Shrem. \u201cWe raised a few hundred thousand dollars, and then we refunded everyone\u2019s money.\u201d Shrem decided to walk away. It was easier to take the hit to his reputation than live in fear.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>That\u2019s one of the paradoxes of cryptocurrency: Each new development seems to bring both great promise and great peril. ICOs are the next big chapter, after crowdfunding, in the democratization and decentralization of finance, says Brock Pierce, a co-founder of a San Francisco venture capital firm, Blockchain Capital, that invests in cryptocurrency startups. His firm recently raised $10 million by issuing its own blockchain token, becoming the first venture capital firm in the world to do so. (The token sold out in six hours.)<\/p>\n<p>But many of the ICOs conducted so far have played fast and loose with regulations, he says, operating in a gray area. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way that people are going about doing it,\u201d says Pierce. That the SEC hasn\u2019t yet cracked down means nothing, he says. \u201cGood entrepreneurs with the best of intentions, who want to innovate and change the world, are going to end up in jail\u2014or with fines.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shrem agrees. \u201cI try to explain to people that in any other industry it\u2019s okay to try new things and break shit, but in fintech, because you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s money, it\u2019s a lot more difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially in the Bitcoin and blockchain space. The government is always watching.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now, though, the ICO market is surging\u2014despite fears of a bubble and scams\u2014and mainstream investors are entering. In May, billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper, long bullish on Bitcoin, announced that he would take part in an ICO for the first time. The crowd sale, planned for July, is for the token powering Tezos, a smart-contracts platform that Draper says will be \u201cmore secure and more democratic\u201d than Ethereum.<\/p>\n<p>Draper says he expects in the future to see tokens for \u201ceverything from health care to insurance to commodities.\u201d Tokens, he says, are both \u201ca brave new frontier\u201d and a \u201cWild West.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The failure of Intellisys cost Shrem. \u201cI expended social capital on it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have to get that back.\u201d In March he tells me that he wants to make a comeback, but it has to be the right sort of comeback. \u201cI need to show that I didn\u2019t just get lucky one time\u201d with BitInstant, he says, \u201cbut that I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He had moved to Sarasota with his fianc\u00e9e and was living with her and his future mother-in-law in a rented pink townhouse. He was spending his abundant off-hours relaxing on the beach, eating in nice restaurants, boating, Jet Skiing. He was mellower and more patient than in the past. He decided that if an opportunity came to get in on the ground floor of \u201csomething amazing,\u201d he would seize it. That turned out to be a full-time job as Jaxx\u2019s head of business and community development. The company\u2019s values appealed to him: Jaxx users are in control of their own funds. \u201cIt goes toward my vision of you being in control of your own money, you being in control of your own freedom,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>March was the first profitable month for Jaxx, which lets users (now more than 100,000) exchange one virtual coin for another. Now its founder, Anthony Di Iorio, who cofounded Ether\u00adeum, wants to expand to other countries, such as China, and Shrem will be a key part of that process. He is in charge of turning relationships into revenue, working with developers to add their cryptocoins to Jaxx\u2019s stable. Dozens of new partnerships are in the works.<\/p>\n<p>But they have to be the right coins. Having helped Bitcoin grow from a stripling to a giant, Shrem is confident he can tell which crypto-projects have real promise\u2014and which don\u2019t. He thinks if he can help build Jaxx, he\u2019ll \u201cbe a major industry player again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His timing may be good. According to Carlson-Wee, \u201cthe real Cambrian explosion of tokenized assets\u201d is still a couple of years away. That\u2019s when he expects to see technology that would let Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and other blockchain networks communicate. As it stands, they\u2019re isolated from one another. (The concept has spawned another name in the argot: \u201cparachains,\u201d a reference to the idea of bringing parallel blockchains together.)<\/p>\n<p>Parachains would allow applications and smart contracts built on one system to interact with another system\u2019s assets. An Ethereum smart contract could be triggered by the balance in a Bitcoin wallet address, for instance. This would help overcome the network effect of the oldest cryptocurrency. Just as Bitcoin faces an uphill battle against currencies like the U.S. dollar, so new cryptocurrencies are at a disadvantage to Bitcoin, which has the broadest name recognition and biggest user base.<\/p>\n<p>Forging bonds between blockchains would allow users to flow easily from Bitcoin to Dash to Ethereum to Zcash, strengthening the entire ecosystem and making all of it more valuable. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re keyed into any cryptocurrency, you\u2019ll have access to every cryptocurrency,\u201d Carlson-Wee says.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin was created to be the money of the Internet. Its successors may build a new kind of Internet, a Web 3.0 of interconnected blockchains running countless applications. Charlie Shrem is determined to be in the middle of it all.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em><span class=\"s1\">Brian Patrick Eha is the author of <\/span><\/em><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/178074658X\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=fortune028-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=178074658X&amp;linkId=753b01ca9fca2275daa3485bb3fb060d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Money Got Free: Bitcoin and the Fight for the Future of Finance<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2017 issue of Fortune.

And it has caught almost everyone by surprise. As recently as last summer, the narrative had been that Tesla just didn\u2019t get China. The automaker was on track for its third consecutive year of weak sales. The few consumers who knew about Teslas didn\u2019t know how to recharge one; those who preordered had faced delivery delays and iffy service. What\u2019s more, Tesla lacked the joint-venture partners that helped other foreign carmakers break into China\u2019s market. Michael Dunne, who runs independent advisory Dunne Automotive in Hong Kong, wrote a column in September predicting Elon Musk would reach Mars before cracking China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Today, Dunne is cheerfully sheepish about that column, and other naysayers are equally befuddled. There\u2019s no single explanation for Tesla\u2019s breakthrough. Sales got a lift from the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/02\/02\/tesla-model-x-china\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">introduction of the Model X<\/a>, a luxury SUV for an SUV-mad country. The company also benefited from a critical mass of charging stations; from its direct-sales model, in a country where buyers feel fleeced by dealerships; and from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/04\/27\/elon-musk-china-tesla\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CEO Elon Musk\u2019s celebrity among the technorati<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">But chummy government relations also matter in a country where the state exerts enormous economic control, and Tesla\u2019s technology just happens to align perfectly with government priorities. Cofounder Martin Eberhard has said Tesla was started to fight climate change. Nowhere is the climate fight more important than in China, the world\u2019s largest spewer of greenhouse gases, which is in the midst of an unprecedented promotion of electric cars: Last year, sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in China rose 50% to 507,000, more than three times the U.S. figure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048100\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes_car_sales\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239\" data-orig-size=\"610,239\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tes_car_sales\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Graphic shows number of cars sold in China and the U.S., and the share of electric vehicles&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239?w=610\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2048100 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=610&#038;h=239\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png 610w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=150&amp;h=59 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes_car_sales.png?w=300&amp;h=118 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The government estimates that as many as 7 million electric cars could be sold in China annually by 2025. It sees them as a way not only to clear smoggy skies, but to hack into the top rankings of the global auto industry. In electric, Chinese companies don\u2019t have to match the quality of a <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/ford-motor\/\" target=\"_blank\">Ford<\/a> or Mercedes-Benz; they think they can quickly build a whole new car. \u201cFor electric vehicles in China, we have a new technology model every two years,\u201d says Dong Yang, a high-ranking Communist Party official at the China Association of Automotive Manufacturers, the auto lobby.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Still, virtually all Chinese electric cars are low-cost, relatively low-performance ones, without the luxury trimmings and lightning-fast acceleration that Tesla owners fetishize. Government officials consider Tesla a role model for these Chinese brands, and they\u2019ve cheered the company from the sidelines. Today, a handful of Chinese companies and cities are feverishly courting Tesla for a joint venture, <i>Fortune<\/i> has learned, and Musk has said his company could begin building cars in China before the end of 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">A joint venture could turn Tesla\u2019s China growth stratospheric, because its current model of importing cars from California is costly. Chinese tariffs and taxes boost the price of Tesla\u2019s sedans and SUVs in the country by 50% compared with the U.S.; the Model S sedan starts at the equivalent of $105,000, and the Model X at $130,000. So even as Tesla woos middle-class buyers in the U.S. (the Model 3, due to arrive this fall, will start at about $35,000) buyers in China have mostly resembled Vanessa Zhu: wealthy drivers who view Teslas as luxury vehicles, or at least as the coolest new piece of tech since the iPhone. Most of Tesla\u2019s 2016 sales were concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, China\u2019s centers of capital and affluence.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047106\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.kiddie Tesla\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2047106 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=2880&#038;h=1920\" alt=\"\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-kid-tesla.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2880px) 100vw, 2880px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A child steers a \u201cModel S for Kids\u201d (also battery-powered) at a Tesla event at a Beijing mall.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Even if Tesla doesn\u2019t become a mass-market brand, sales in China alone could soon climb to 100,000 a year, impacting Tesla as intensely as a new, 1.4-billion-person market would <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola<\/a>. \u201cI could see a future where Tesla is displacing a lot of those Audis and Mercedes-Benz that are everywhere on Chinese roads,\u201d says Dunne.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Not bad for a company that, until recently, was digging out from under past mistakes.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\">Tesla began taking preorders in China for the Model S in August 2013. The company didn\u2019t know exactly how much each car would cost, and deliveries were eight months away. But anticipation ran high. The combination of Musk\u2019s renown, stories comparing Tesla\u2019s acceleration to a Ferrari\u2019s, and intrigue over the new technology sent preorders above 5,000 by the end of the year.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The hype was there, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/03\/10\/tesla-china-problem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">but the sales and support were not<\/a>. <\/span>The original head of Tesla\u2019s China business was Kingston Chang,<span class=\"s2\"> formerly of luxury automaker Bentley. Chang wanted to broadly expand Tesla\u2019s operations, including customer service centers, <\/span>public relations, and car-charging networks, according to tech <span class=\"s2\">news site PingWest. But Tesla headquarters told him to build a sales team first, betting that good marketing could bring in more revenue before more stores and charging stations were finished being built. Tesla opened just a single showroom in Beijing, opposite an American Apparel store in one of the city\u2019s glitziest malls.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048099\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tesla_stats\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462\" data-orig-size=\"610,462\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tesla_stats\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Charts show Tesla car units sale and revenues&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462?w=610\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2048099 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=610&#038;h=462\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png 610w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tesla_stats.png?w=300&amp;h=227 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Tesla\u2019s strategy shifted again after Veronica Wu came aboard in December 2013, after a successful stint in big enterprise and education sales for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> in China. At Tesla, she discussed adding traditional outlets like dealerships to the mix, similar to the way Apple had added retail channels in China. Though headquarters balked, Tesla in China was soon encouraging fleet sales orders of 100 or more cars from car-rental agencies and institutions, to jump-start demand. Staff, especially salespeople, soared from 10 employees to more than 100, and later to 600. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">At the same time, Tesla imposed rules that frustrated individual buyers. Before customers could order a car, Tesla required that they prove they had a parking spot and a home charger, to ensure a good experience. The company also required that buyers live in a city that had a Tesla service center\u2014even though, as of mid-2014, only Beijing and Shanghai had such centers. Some high-rise apartment managers, meanwhile, balked at having chargers installed in their buildings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The mismatch between Tesla\u2019s approach and customer demand created a big opportunity for gray-market resellers\u2014who bought in bulk and catered to buyers who didn\u2019t meet Tesla\u2019s criteria. The company had no official resellers, but the cars made their way to many, who sold in dealerships, car centers, and even on Alibaba\u2019s TMall for more than the same models cost on Tesla\u2019s website. \u201cThere were a lot more scalpers than we expected,\u201d Wu now says. Others questioned whether the company was really in the dark: \u201cMost \u2018fleet\u2019 sales were just a flimsy cover for sales to resellers,\u201d concluded Bertel Schmitt of Dailykanban.com, an auto industry site. It was all legal, but also a sign that Tesla had strayed from the high-touch sales approach it used elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Tesla\u2019s first China deliveries arrived in spring 2014; Wu later told Reuters that China sales could drive 35% of the company\u2019s growth. But that was already sounding fanciful. Tesla was hurriedly building customer-service centers, and customers outside of Beijing and Shanghai were told they wouldn\u2019t get their cars until those centers were finished. One buyer made national news when he smashed the windshield of his own Tesla, after it arrived months later than expected. Meanwhile, the Chinese press didn\u2019t shower Tesla with as much coverage as the West\u2019s did. As a result, most potential customers didn\u2019t know much about Tesla\u2019s product. Consumers didn\u2019t know they could charge their car at home every night like a cell phone; most thought they had to rely on the still-small Supercharger network.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047111\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.tianenman\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047111\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-tianenman.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Mike Fan drives his Model X past Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square.

About 4,700 cars had been shipped to China, but only 2,500 were sold and registered to drivers. (The company delivered 18,500 cars in the U.S. that year.) Publicly, Tesla blamed the gap on speculators who entered orders, then didn\u2019t buy the Teslas once they shipped. But several former employees say the real problem was the lack of customer support. Says Ricardo Reyes, Tesla\u2019s former communications chief: \u201cI think Tesla took for granted that they were just going to succeed in China.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By December 2014, both Chang and Wu had left Tesla. Tesla executives in California griped privately that China wasn\u2019t so unique that it demanded a different strategy. But not long afterward, the company began an apology tour that marked a turning point. On a frigid evening in January 2015, during the Detroit International Auto Show, Musk admitted China sales were \u201cunexpectedly weak.\u201d That spring, he traveled to China to meet with President Xi Jinping and other leaders, tweeting that he remained \u201cvery optimistic\u201d despite \u201cearlier mistakes.\u201d Reyes offered a mea culpa at the Shanghai auto show in spring 2015, the first Chinese motor show that Tesla bothered attending: \u201cI think we have been a little bit too impatient in the Chinese market.\u201d It was as contrite as the company would get\u2014and the news it was generating was about to get better.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">In 2015, Tom Zhu,<\/span> a respected engineer responsible for China\u2019s Supercharger network, became the top executive in the country. The company ended that year with a disappointing 3,700 cars sold, but there were slivers of optimism. For one thing, Tesla was building Supercharger locations in China at a faster pace than anywhere in the world, addressing consumers\u2019 \u201ccharge anxiety.\u201d About 120 Supercharger locations exist in China today, compared with 370 in the U.S., and Tesla says China will have more than 800 charging stations by the end of 2017.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047107\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-skyline\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.skyline\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047107\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-skyline.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Vanessa Zhu drives her Tesla Model X through the Central Business District in Beijing.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">Just as important: Word was getting out that buying a Tesla was easier than buying other luxury cars. In China, dealerships known as \u201c4S stores\u201d (for \u201cservice, spare parts, sale, and survey\u201d) largely corner the market for popular luxury brands like BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, and Mercedes-Benz. The stores inflate costs for consumers by tens of thousands of dollars with various vague fees. Tesla\u2019s direct-sales showrooms eschew that system. And while import tariffs increase their overall cost, Tesla otherwise prices its cars in China at the same level that it does in the U.S. after currency adjustments.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Vanessa Zhu visited three other brands before she settled on her Model X. The Range Rover dealership asked for an additional 300,000 yuan ($45,000) as its standard fee, she says; Porsche told her she had to wait three months for its Cayenne SUV and required a 100,000-yuan delivery fee. Tesla in contrast, put her on a one-size-fits-all waiting list and didn\u2019t impose fees. \u201cIn China, a car is a symbol of your status, so most people don\u2019t care what you pay in terms of those extra fees,\u201d Zhu says. \u201cBut I do care. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tesla owners also found out they could beat China\u2019s bureaucracy in the license-plate game. China\u2019s local governments restrict the number of drivers on their clogged, polluted streets by controlling the number of plates issued. Drivers have to wait years to get one through a lottery system. (In early 2015, 6.2 million people applied for just 36,757 available Beijing plates.) And once drivers get a plate, they are barred from driving one day a week.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But plates for electric cars now fall under different rules, thanks to the government\u2019s push for electric vehicles. Beginning in 2014, Shanghai allowed electric-car drivers to get a license plate without facing a wait, a $12,000 plate fee, or driving restrictions. Other cities followed suit, and such policies became a boon for China\u2019s electric-car makers. Without them, \u201cthere\u2019s no possibility that private consumers would buy these vehicles,\u201d says Zhang Yong, deputy general manager at the electric-car offshoot of state-owned Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The policies were game changers for Tesla too. The first six cities in China to have exempted electric vehicles from license plate restrictions: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. The cities with the highest Tesla sales, according to Junheng Li of JL Warren Capital: Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Tianjin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">While the policies helped sell Model S sedans, Tesla realized quickly that the Model X would be a much bigger story in China. China\u2019s obsession with SUVs is 10 years old and going strong. Their popularity stems from a variety of factors: Domestic \u00admakers produce good models; their seating can accommodate an entire extended family; they\u2019re widely believed to be safer; and their higher prices imbue status. German luxury-car maker Porsche\u2019s bestselling vehicle in China isn\u2019t a sports car but its Macan SUV.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">By 2015, SUV sales were the only growing part of the Chinese auto market; in the first half of 2016, SUVs accounted for 35% of passenger-vehicle sales. It\u2019s no coincidence, then, that a spike in Tesla sales coincides exactly with the first Model X deliveries in China, in June 2016. In the second half of last year, with the SUV available, Tesla notched 7,670 sales\u2014about three-quarters of its total for the year in China. Tesla\u2019s sales had finally caught up to its hype.<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><b><\/b><span class=\"s1\">Close government relations<\/span> <span class=\"s2\">are a must in China for foreign companies, and Tesla has carefully cultivated them. Like Apple, Tesla has created new businesses thanks to its demand for Chinese-made components, particularly its cars\u2019 giant touch screens. In 2015, Tom Zhu said Tesla would double its spending on Chinese-made parts, committing to buying $500 million worth of supplies from Chinese companies that year; such spending has likely only skyrocketed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">The far bigger question mark is whether, and when, Tesla will announce plans for a factory in the country. Every car brand with significant China sales\u2014including luxury-auto makers like Mercedes-Benz and BMW\u2014runs a joint venture with a local partner. The government has required as much for decades. Imported cars face hefty fees, as Tesla owners are painfully aware. <\/span>A Model 3 sedan\u2019s $35,000 starting price <span class=\"s2\">in the U.S. becomes $50,000 in China after a 25% tariff and 17% value-added tax\u2014a heavy lift for a middle-class buyer. \u201cIf they don\u2019t announce plans for local production, they will struggle to sustain this performance,\u201d says Bill Russo, former head of Chrysler North East Asia and managing director of Gao Feng Advisory in Shanghai.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Tesla remains cagey about what those plans could look like. Dong Yang, the auto lobby official, says several potential local partners are courting the company, and that multiple provinces and municipalities want Tesla to build a plant with them: \u201cThey all offer better and better options,\u201d Dong says.

If you build fewer than 100,000 vehicles a year, it doesn\u2019t make sense to manufacture in China, says Steve Man, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, Calif., can churn out more than 500,000 vehicles annually. Even if it doubles China sales this year, Tesla will just pass 20,000 cars. It faces a catch-22: It won\u2019t sell cars at lower prices that drive sales if it doesn\u2019t produce them locally, but local production won\u2019t be economical until sales rise drastically. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Intellectual property is a looming headache as well. Critics of Chinese business practices argue that Tesla faces certain IP theft as soon as it brings manufacturing into China. \u201cYes, some of its tech will be stolen,\u201d says Crystal Chang, a lecturer at University of California at Berkeley who studies China\u2019s auto market. But Chang adds that the danger inherent in that theft is overstated. \u201cJust stealing tech does not make [a rival] a competitor,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\">Today more than a dozen Chinese-backed manufacturers (many of them American startups that now have Chinese owners) are tripping over one another to promote their electric cars and acceleration times; Faraday Future, Karma Automotive, NextEV, and Future Mobility are but a few. But most are likely to be stuck in the concept or prototype phase for the next several years\u2014even as Teslas zip across China.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p2\">That\u2019s one reason Tesla may be able to reach an agreement to produce cars in the country on favorable terms. China lusts after Tesla\u2019s technology but also its management practices. And Tesla already offers its patents to anyone who asks\u2014making it highly plausible that Musk would agree to more information-sharing in return for a vastly expanded market for Tesla\u2019s cars.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2047112\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-tesla-china\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"2880,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adam Dean&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"TES.06.15.17.traditional gate\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2047112\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/tes-06-15-17-traditional-gate.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Mike Fan drives his Tesla Model X through an arch in a traditional &#8216;hutong&#8217; alley near Lama Temple in Beijing.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Photograph by Adam Dean\u2014Panos Pictures for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p2\">One big Chinese corporate player seems to have no doubt about Tesla\u2019s prospects. In late March, Tencent, the politically connected technology giant that recently became one of the world\u2019s 10 largest publicly traded companies, said it spent $1.8 billion buying Tesla stock. Not long afterward, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization edged past that of <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/general-motors\/\" target=\"_blank\">General Motors<\/a>, making it the most valuable American automaker.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">On a recent<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> Sunday night, three dozen prospective buyers gather in a Tesla showroom in Beijing for a wine tasting.

Now it wants to become the ESPN of competitive gaming. Will audiences play along?<\/h2>\n<p>A diapered dragon hatches from a polka-dotted egg. Casting off the speckled shards of its shell, it toddles out of its nest and crawls around curiously, flapping a pair of adorably tiny purple wings. Seconds later, a trio of extraterrestrial troublemakers appear, taunting the mythological infant. \u201cI <i>looove<\/i> baby dragons,\u201d their three-fingered ringleader says menacingly as he and his cohorts encircle their prey. \u201cEspecially medium-rare ones.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The diminutive dragon abruptly lashes out, disabling his opponents with a surprisingly forceful flame. \u201cOh yeah, Spyro wins!\u201d he gloats, trampolining on one of the fallen aliens with his chubby, clawed legs. Out of nowhere, a tall wizard with a Viking helmet appears and offers him a half-eaten corn dog. \u201cIt\u2019s barely touched,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, I\u2019m completely lost (a sensation that will recur several times while I\u2019m reporting this story). But were I quite a few years younger\u2014and a gamer\u2014I would have recognized the creatures on my screen as characters from <i>Skylanders,<\/i> a $3.5 billion \u201ctoys-to-life\u201d franchise created by videogame powerhouse <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\" target=\"_blank\">Activision Blizzard<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"atvi\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">atvi<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span>. The Southern California company publishes several of the most popular titles in gaming history, from multiplayer combat series like <i>World of Warcraft<\/i> to smartphone time-suckers like <i>Candy Crush Saga.<\/i> The <i>Skylanders<\/i> franchise, which launched in 2011, has sold 300 million action figures and other toys in six years.<\/p>\n<p>The only part of this scene that might have struck my hypothetical gamer self as remotely odd is that, well, none of it took place during a game. Rather, I\u2019ve just watched the opening two minutes of the first season of <i>Skylanders Academy,<\/i> a TV spinoff that made its debut on <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"nflx\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/netflix\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">nflx<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> in October. That program signals a new chapter for Activision Blizzard, a gaming Goliath that is attempting to hack-and-slash its way into becoming a more diversified\u2014and even more gargantuan\u2014entertainment juggernaut.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s growth to date, on games alone, already belongs on some sort of high scorer honor roll. In its last fiscal year, Activision Blizzard reported <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/05\/04\/activision-overwatch-strong-quarter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">record revenue<\/a> of $6.6 billion, up 42% from the year before. Over the past five years, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/09\/29\/activision-electronic-arts-shares\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">its stock price<\/a> has risen more than 400%. The leader behind that performance, CEO Bobby Kotick, is now the longest-serving head of any publicly traded tech company\u2014and one of the highest paid. According to a recent <i>New York Times<\/i> report, Kotick was the 10th-best-compensated CEO in the U.S. last year, with a pay package of $33.1 million, nearly $25 million of it in stock. (Kotick is also dating one of the most powerful leaders in tech, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> COO Sheryl Sandberg.)<\/p>\n<p>This year, Activision Blizzard earned <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a spot on the <i>Fortune<\/i> 500<\/a> list for the first time in the company\u2019s 37-year history. In this industry, that\u2019s very rare air. Only two other videogame-centric companies have ever made the <i>Fortune<\/i> 500: Electronic Arts <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ea\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/electronic-arts\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ea<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> and industry pioneer Atari. And neither had staying power: Electronic Arts graced the list just once, in 2010, while \u00adAtari lasted two years\u20141988 and 1989. (After several ownership changes and a bankruptcy, Atari is now part of a French media company.) The takeaway: Gaming may be mainstream entertainment, but game companies are hit-driven\u2014and none has successfully expanded beyond videogames.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:350px;\" ><a href=\"http:\/\/beta.fortune.com\/fortune500\/activision-blizzard\/\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2049382\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/500_rank_activision\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254\" data-orig-size=\"1200,870\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.500_rank_activision\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2049382\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&#038;h=254\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=350&amp;h=254 350w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=700&amp;h=508 700w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/500_rank_activision.png?w=300&amp;h=218 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Activision Blizzard&#8217;s 2017 rank in the Fortune 500.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Activision Blizzard hopes to be the first.

Last year the gamemaker acquired Major League Gaming (MLG), a creator and distributor of e\u2011sports events. \u201cIt is like ESPN for videogames,\u201d Kotick tells <i>Fortune.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>MLG is still light years away from ESPN-level domination. But if anything, Kotick\u2019s analogy actually undersells his ambitions: It might be more accurate if ESPN not only distributed football games but also owned the National Football League\u2014and made all the footballs in the world as well. Later this year, Activision Blizzard will launch the Overwatch League, based on one of the company\u2019s hottest new titles. The league will essentially control all the competing teams and the distribution of all the games. Activision thinks that these opportunities, combined with sponsorships and advertising, not to mention <i>Overwatch<\/i>-branded merchandise like T-shirts and hats, could bring the company billions in annual revenue as the e\u2011sports audience grows. As a benchmark for how big it could get, the company notes that the NFL generates $12 billion in revenues, including $6.1 billion in media rights sales, from an audience of about 240 million. \u201cTen years from now, the role models in e\u2011sports [will] be like the stars in traditional sports,\u201d Kotick says.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048756\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-fanbase\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;David Chen&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1478268357&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;www.davidchen.gg&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.fanbase\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2048756 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" alt=\"\" width=\"2800\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg 2800w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-fanbase.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Player Marcus Tan Sin Yik on Team Singapore Overwatch at BlizzCon 2016, a gathering of fans of Blizzard Entertainment games.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Activision Blizzard<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>These are just aspirations for now. MLG, like the company\u2019s other recent undertakings, hasn\u2019t yet resulted in new operating profits. And even if it were an instant hit, its revenue would be a teeny fraction of the NFL\u2019s. Still, Kotick, 54, has had his share of touchdowns. In 26 years as CEO, he has transformed Activision Blizzard from a financial mess nearing extinction into a behemoth with a $45 billion market cap and 17 gamemaking studios around the world, aggressively buying up other gamemakers and continually expanding its franchises.<\/p>\n<p>Relevancy demands constant growth and constant hits, and Kotick\u2019s latest strategy, finding new ways of milking profits from his IP, is one way of extending Activision Blizzard\u2019s dominance. If the idea sounds Disneyesque\u2014well, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/disney\/\" target=\"_blank\">Disney<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"dis\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/disney\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">dis<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> experts would agree. \u201cThe approach he is taking leads them down a road similar to the one Disney has been on in the last 15 years or so,\u201d says Tom Staggs, the former COO and CFO of Disney and a longtime friend of Kotick\u2019s.

Activision Blizzard has long been criticized for focusing on existing franchises instead of investing in new and innovative products. There is a fine line between breathing new life into your franchises and pumping them so hard for profits that you suck the life out of them\u2014and drive away your fans. As Atari cofounder Nolan Bushnell points out, \u201cThe financial strategy for these big blockbusters can lead to things getting stale because you want to do <i>Rocky<\/i> No. 247 instead of innovate\u2009\u2026\u2009But entertainment is ultimately about novelty.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Do even a cursory search of gamer blogs and you\u2019ll see some colorful vilifications of Kotick. (Univision-owned blog Kotaku once called him \u201cthe most hated man in videogames,\u201d though the writer also said he had a \u201cdelightful chat\u201d with the exec.) Much of the animosity comes from ROI-minded things that Kotick has told the investment community\u2014he once said at a conference that his focus was taking \u201cthe fun out of making videogames.\u201d But no one disputes his success.<\/p>\n<p>The college dropout got his start as a developer for the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple<\/a> II in the early 1980s. At just 19, he founded a software company, Arktronics, with funding from Las Vegas developer Steve Wynn\u2014the two had met at a party in Texas. Arktronics eventually went out of business, but in 1990, when Kotick was 27, he convinced Wynn and another partner to buy a controlling stake in Activision, a gaming company founded by four former Atari programmers. Activision was a pioneer\u2014it was the first gamemaker that wasn\u2019t owned by a console provider\u2014but it was mired in bankruptcy proceedings related to a patent-infringement lawsuit. For $500,000, Kotick and his team snapped up a 25% stake. By 1991 the determined entrepreneur was the CEO.<\/p>\n<p>Kotick quickly reorganized the company. In an ecosystem where new games are generally created by startups, Kotick proved adept at spotting companies with great ideas and sustainable profitability\u2014and then gobbling them up\u2014staff, IP, and all. Over the ensuing decades, Activision grew primarily through acquisitions, including those of Raven Software and skateboarding gamemaker Neversoft. In 2008, Activision merged with the gaming division of French media conglomerate Vivendi. Blizzard was one of the studios within that portfolio: It had an impeccable reputation for quality and a loyal following\u2014among other titles, it published the popular <i>Warcraft<\/i> franchise. Activision Blizzard was formed, with Kotick still at the head.<\/p>\n<p>Like all companies vying for consumers\u2019 attention, Activision Blizzard now faces more rivals than ever. \u201cThat includes people watching shows on Netflix, movies, or anything else,\u201d says Brian Nowak, a Morgan Stanley analyst who covers the company. Anything else <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/22\/mobile-gaming-pc-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">includes \u201ccasual\u201d mobile games<\/a> played on smartphones. While it typically takes multiple years and tens of millions of dollars to design a graphics-heavy standard videogame, mobile games are fast and cheap. Activision Blizzard has managed not only to mitigate those threats, but also to thrive. (Its most significant recent acquisition was <i>Candy Crush<\/i> maker King Digital Entertainment, in 2016.) It can also now deliver many of its games online\u2014allowing for faster, cheaper updates and, importantly, for in-game purchases and upgrades.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignright\" style=\"max-width:280px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-bobbykotick.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048774\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-bobbykotick\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-bobbykotick.jpg?w=280&#038;h=382\" data-orig-size=\"1407,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;9&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Cody Pickens&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Hasselblad H4D-40&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1495209369&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 M.

But analysts say that edition sold less than its predecessors. Set in outer space, the installment was criticized by fans of the franchise for being too futuristic. This year\u2019s <i>Call of Duty<\/i> title (a new version is published each year) will go back to the game\u2019s World War II roots.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe should have done more work thinking about how much of a departure from the franchise going to space would be,\u201d admits Kotick. But the mini-uprising also underscores the fickle nature of the business\u2014and the importance of extending durable brands in new ways.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a warm afternoon in mid-May when I meet Kotick at Blizzard\u2019s studio in Irvine, Calif. As at many Silicon Valley companies, the studio\u2019s workforce is mostly young and largely male. But there are a lot more tattoos and purple hair than you\u2019d find at, say, Facebook\u2019s fresh-faced HQ. It isn\u2019t as bright and cheerful here, either\u2014game developers and designers, it turns out, have a penchant for dungeon-like lighting. Seated in a corner of the cafeteria, Kotick stands out. In khakis, brown loafers, and a button-down shirt under a sweater vest, he looks less like a tech mogul and more like an off-duty attorney visiting his coding-crazy kid at work.<\/p>\n<p>Kotick\u2019s voice is so low and muted that I have to lean in to hear him (my recording would barely pick up his answers). His ambition, however, speaks loudly. \u201cThe fact that we can entertain people in every country, everywhere in the world\u2014that was always an aspiration I had,\u201d says Kotick.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>SQUEEZING CASH FROM BLOCKBUSTER GAMES<\/h2>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048754\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-characters\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976\" data-orig-size=\"1424,976\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.characters\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2048754 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1424&#038;h=976\" alt=\"\" width=\"1424\" height=\"976\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg 1424w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=768&amp;h=526 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-characters.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1424px) 100vw, 1424px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Characters from an array of Activision Blizzard games.<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Activision Blizzard<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Activision Blizzard\u2019s success has been driven by smart repetition: It builds (or buys) games with great hooks, then franchises them like crazy.

Steve Bornstein, a former CEO of ESPN and cable\u2019s NFL Network, is the chair of Kotick\u2019s e\u2011sports division (former Fox Sports EVP Pete Vlastelica, meanwhile, is its CEO). A former Disney exec, Tim Kilpin, was recently hired to run the company\u2019s consumer products division. (One more Mouse House connection: Sandberg, Kotick\u2019s girlfriend, serves on Disney\u2019s board of directors.) And Stacey Sher, the long-time producing partner of Quentin Tarantino, is now copresident of Activision Blizzard\u2019s fledgling TV and film business.<\/p>\n<p>Kotick feels confident he\u2019s placed bets on the right people; time will tell if he\u2019s picked the right game.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Somewhere on the Internet, a young woman named Riley Youngs is eating a chicken sandwich, and scores of people\u2014myself included\u2014are watching the mundane act in real time. Youngs is a budding \u201cstreamer,\u201d someone who plays videogames online for a living. Her forum of choice is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitch<\/a>, a wildly popular, Amazon-owned website that showcases gamers who broadcast themselves.<\/p>\n<p>About 150,000 fans have watched Youngs do her thing online\u2014her thing being playing Activision Blizzard\u2019s <i>Overwatch<\/i>, along with the occasional live-streamed lunch break. Today\u2019s video stream is titled \u201cLOOK AT MA NEW FOKIN HAIRCUT,\u201d which refers to her \u00adbelow-the-shoulder-length locks, dark brown on top and almost blond underneath.<\/p>\n<p>Viewers follow along. In the main box on the busy web page is a dynamic screenshot of the game on her computer. To the left, a smaller square shows Youngs via webcam as she sits at her monitor. And to the right runs a constant feed of comments and questions from her thousands of viewers\u2014inquiring minds who want to know what virtual weapon she\u2019s going to pick up next and how much she paid for her new hairdo.<\/p>\n<p>This stream will last more than six hours. (Youngs, a 24-year-old from Michigan, later tells me she streams for four to eight hours a day). I have a much shorter attention span, but I watch long enough to see why <i>Overwatch,<\/i> a multiplayer, first-person-shooter title, has become Blizzard\u2019s fastest-growing game to date, generating more than $1 billion in revenue and amassing 30 million players since its introduction just a year ago\u2014and why it\u2019s the game to which Kotick is harnessing his e\u2011sports ambitions.<\/p>\n<p>Youngs\u2019 character runs through some kind of high-elevation temple, encircled by snowcapped mountains, shooting at creatures that are moving so fast it\u2019s hard to make them out. All you see of her in-game self is the tip of the futuristic, golden firearm with which she kills off opponents. On the smaller screen, I see the face of \u201cin real life\u201d Youngs, mostly scrunched in a concentrated squint.<\/p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, the experience is like staring into a digital version of an M.C. Escher print. But for millions, the site\u2014and others like it\u2014presents <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2016\/04\/06\/most-popular-esports-games-on-twitch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hours of engaged entertainment<\/a>. Activision Blizzard has about 450 million monthly users globally, who spent a collective 43 billion hours playing its games last year. Notably, a record 3 billion hours were spent <i>viewing<\/i> its games in that same time span.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen people ask me what I do, I say I play videogames,\u201d says Brandon \u201cSeagull\u201d Larned, one of the best-known <i>Overwatch<\/i> streamers. \u201cThey think it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Larned explains that there are two career paths for gamers. The first is streaming, which allows players with considerable followings to share in profit from advertising. The second involves endorsements and prizes for competing in pro tournaments.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2048777\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" data-orig-size=\"2800,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NIKON D4S&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1463762434&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;28&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.003125&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ACT.06.15.17.hollywoodblvd\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2048777 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=2800&#038;h=1920\" alt=\"\" width=\"2800\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg 2800w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=768&amp;h=527 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-hollywoodblvd.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2800px) 100vw, 2800px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">A character from the game &#8220;Overwatch&#8221; on display near the Hollywood Walk of Fame .<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Courtesy of Activision Blizzard<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>A few high-end streamers and e\u2011sports competitors make seven-figure salaries; most do not. While Larned doesn\u2019t disclose his income, he does say he quit a computer science program at Washington State because \u201cthere was too much money to be made\u201d as a professional gamer. Larned, known for his \u201cdazzling Genji play\u201d (don\u2019t ask), may soon have an even bigger career opportunity\u2014the 24-year-old is a contender for the Overwatch League.<\/p>\n<p>At the moment, viewership for gaming is not unlike golf\u2014if you play golf, you\u2019ll watch golf. But Kotick hopes to make e\u2011sports more mainstream, more sticky. One way he\u2019s doing that: instituting teams that are city-based\u2014a first in professional e\u2011sports. Just like Green Bay\u2019s Packers, <i>Overwatch<\/i> teams will be tied to cities. (Activision Blizzard hasn\u2019t yet said how many teams will exist and in which locations.) Of course, unlike the NFL\u2014or the NBA, the MLB, or the NHL\u2014<i>Overwatch<\/i> has been around for only a year. \u201cIf I\u2019m [a potential sponsor], I have a pretty good confidence that the L.A. Kings [hockey team] will be around in five years,\u201d says Morgan Stanley\u2019s Nowak. \u201cBut how do I know that <i>Overwatch<\/i> will?\u201d Still, Activision Blizzard thinks <i>Overwatch<\/i> has advantages, despite its \u201cnoob\u201d status (gamer-speak for new). Going with a recently launched title lets the league start from scratch\u2014more established titles like <i>Call of Duty<\/i> or <i>World of Warcraft<\/i> are already played by several existing e\u2011sports teams and leagues.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard doesn\u2019t have to deal with the legacy TV networks that have tied up traditional sports rights for years. \u201cE\u2011sports is the first digital native sport,\u201d says Vlastelica, the Fox Sports veteran who heads MLG. \u201cWe\u2019re not encumbered by the paid-TV ecosystem that keeps the content out of the hands of young people who, frankly, don\u2019t watch TV.\u201d At the same time, the hope is that transforming itself into the \u201cESPN of videogames\u201d will help Activision Blizzard make e\u2011sports more recognizable to the masses. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the evolution of the games themselves to becoming more broadly appealing as a spectator sport,\u201d says Kotick.<\/p>\n<p>That evolution is not lost on the real, Disney-owned ESPN, which launched a dedicated e\u2011sports vertical on its website last year. The audience is \u201cnot enormous,\u201d says Marie Donoghue, EVP of global business and content strategy at ESPN, but \u201cthe fans are passionate and engaged, the athletes and teams are compelling.\u201d She adds, \u201cIt\u2019s also incredibly popular among a demographic we know well\u2014young men.\u201d<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>As lucrative as that demographic is, Kotick\u2019s plans\u2014including the Overwatch League\u2014could enable Activision Blizzard to reach beyond it. The vast majority of e\u2011sports pros, like the majority of gamers, are men. But players like Youngs are reminders that capability in videogames doesn\u2019t rely on muscle mass or size. And the marketing and expansion of other sports leagues has generally led to more gender parity in their audiences\u2014the NFL, for example, says that women now account for almost half its fan base.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s clear that Kotick has this ideal in mind as the Overwatch League gears up. \u201cI think it\u2019s the first game on a broad scale where about half the characters [are] women,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a level playing field.\u201d Indeed, <i>Overwatch<\/i> features equal numbers of men and women heroes plus three \u201comnic\u201d (that means robotic) characters and a male scientist who happens to be a gorilla.<\/p>\n<p>Activision Blizzard\u2019s real-life leaders don\u2019t yet reflect such parity. Only one out of nine board members is female, and there\u2019s not one woman on its eight-person \u201csenior corporate management\u201d team. It\u2019s notable that one of the company\u2019s few leading women\u2014the newish hire, Stacey Sher\u2014is tasked with bringing Activision Blizzard\u2019s IP to movies and TV shows, media that more easily cross gender lines. \u201cYou have to have control of your script and your movies,\u201d says Sher, whose production credits include <i>Garden State<\/i> and <i>The Hateful Eight.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Last year Sher put together a \u201cwriters room\u201d in a house in Los Angeles, where six handpicked creatives sat every day for a month to brainstorm adaptation ideas; they now have three projects in various stages of screenwriting. Of course, they\u2019re all variations on the <i>Call of Duty<\/i> series\u2014a war-driven franchise where male characters dominate. Turns out there\u2019s a daunting amount of testosterone in Activision Blizzard\u2019s DNA.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Kotick\u2019s strategy suggests that he\u2019s willing to alter that code to make Activision Blizzard a bigger, faster-growing entertainment company. In February, in its latest annual report, Activision Blizzard said it will have a light slate of game releases this year when compared with 2016. (There won\u2019t be a new \u201cfull console\u201d <i>Skylanders<\/i> game, for instance.) The implicit message: It\u2019s time for the company to invest in new areas, from its position of strength. If it doesn\u2019t, it risks going the way of its predecessors, companies that became one-hit wonders, metaphorically speaking, no matter how many games they created.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the June 15, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;A Giant Enters a New Arena.&#8221; <\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 7, 2017","published":"2017-06-07 06:30:16","updated":"2017-06-07 06:30:16","minute":"6:30 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/07\/fortune-500-activision-blizzard\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"Activision Blizzard Aims for the Big Leagues","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_image":{"src":"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/act-06-15-17-convention.jpg?w=820&h=570&crop=1","class":"featured-img-home_feature_slideshow","credit":"Courtesy of Activision Blizzard","caption":"&quot;Overwatch&quot; competitors inside the The Overwatch Arena at BlizzCon 2016.

Here&#8217;s what you need to know about safeguarding your digital assets.<\/i><\/h2>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. Under attack<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">In the summer of 2015, several of New York\u2019s most prestigious and trusted corporate law firms, including Cravath Swaine &amp; Moore and Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, found themselves under cyberattack. A trio of hackers in China had snuck into the firms\u2019 computer networks by tricking partners into revealing their email passwords. Once inside the partners\u2019 accounts, the thieves snooped on highly sensitive documents about upcoming mergers. Then, from computers halfway around the world, the cybercrooks allegedly traded on the purloined information, netting $4 million in stock market gains.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Like most other victims of corporate espionage, the firms preferred to keep mum about having been victimized. They feared antagonizing other digital thugs as well as damaging their reputations as keepers of clients\u2019 secrets. Instead, word of the attack leaked in the press and then was confirmed by federal prosecutors and the firms themselves. The Feds made public their discoveries and trumpeted their efforts to bring the alleged perpetrators to justice. \u201cThis case of cyber meets securities fraud should serve as a wake-up call for law firms around the world,\u201d said Preet Bharara, then the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. \u201cYou are and will be the targets of cyberhacking because you have information valuable to would-be criminals.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068797\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac07_a\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674\" data-orig-size=\"8457,5564\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;P65+&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1497539459&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0080000237565665&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HAC.07.01.17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2068797 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=674\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=674 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1348 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=300&amp;h=197 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_a.jpg?w=768&amp;h=505 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">The Voorhes for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\">It may have been a shock to the system for the legal community, but the incident only served to underscore a hard truth that CEOs, company directors, and network security experts have been grappling with for some time now: Business is under assault like never before from hackers, and the cost and severity of the problem is escalating almost daily.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The latest statistics are a call to arms: According to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/cisco-systems\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco<\/a>, the number of so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks\u2014assaults that flood a system\u2019s servers with junk web traffic\u2014jumped globally by 172% in 2016. Cisco projects the total to grow by another two and a half times, to 3.1 million attacks, by 2021. Indeed, the pace of cyberassaults is only increasing. Internet security firm Nexusguard reports that it observed a 380% increase in the number of DDoS attacks in the first quarter of 2017 compared with a year earlier.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">As the number and scale of network attacks grow, the toll on business is rising. The average total cost of a data breach in the U.S. in 2014 was $5.85 million, according to research from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/ibm\/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM<\/a> and the Ponemon Institute, and this year it\u2019s estimated to be $7.35 million. According to a report earlier this year from business insurer Hiscox, cybercrime cost the global economy more than $450 billion in 2016. The WannaCry ransomware attack alone, which crippled computers in more than 150 countries in May, could cost as much as $4 billion according to some estimates.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more, read &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-hacks-history\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here Are 10 of the Biggest Corporate Hacks in History<\/a>.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2069363\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/cropped-hand-of-computer-hacker-typing-on-keyboard-2\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\" data-orig-size=\"4608,3456\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.7&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Oliver Nicolaas Ponder \\\/ EyeEm&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;E-M10&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1446563835&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Getty Images\\\/EyeEm&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.04&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cropped Hand Of Computer Hacker Typing On Keyboard&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HAC.07.01.17\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2069363 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=768\" alt=\"Cropped Hand Of Computer Hacker Typing On Keyboard\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=768 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1536 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=300&amp;h=225 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/gettyimages-594644139.jpg?w=768&amp;h=576 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Oliver Nicolaas Ponder\/EyeEm Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\">What is slowly dawning on corporate hacking victims is how vulnerable and defenseless they really are, even when their opponents may be three guys in a room halfway around the world. Expensive data-security systems and high-priced information security consultants don\u2019t faze today\u2019s hackers, who have the resources to relentlessly mount assaults until they succeed. In the New York law-firm case, for example, prosecutors said the attackers attempted to penetrate targeted servers more than 100,000 times over seven months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">It has become abundantly clear that no network is completely safe. Where once companies thought they could defend themselves against an onslaught, they\u2019re now realizing that resistance is, if not futile, certainly less important than having a plan in place to detect and neutralize intruders when they strike.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But there remains a gaping chasm between awareness of the threat and readiness to address it: A survey last fall by IBM and Ponemon of 2,400 security and IT professionals found that 75% of the respondents said they did not have a formal cybersecurity incident response plan across their organization. And 66% of those who replied weren\u2019t confident in their organization\u2019s ability to recover from an attack.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Cybercrime is metastasizing for the same reason online services have become so popular with consumers and businesses alike: Ever-more-accessible technology. Hacking is easier than ever thanks to the ever-growing number of online targets and the proliferation of off-the-shelf attack software. The very Internet networks that were built for convenience and profit are exposing their users to a steady stream of new threats.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What\u2019s more, the tense state of affairs is a glaring example of how the entire nature of business has changed in the digital age. In most cases, technology is much more than just a supplement to a company\u2019s core operations. For scores of the world\u2019s most valuable companies\u2014from <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/alphabet\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/amazon-com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a> to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a> to Uber\u2014the assets that live on their networks <i>are<\/i> their core operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">No sector of corporate America is safe. Hackers have plundered big retailers like Neiman Marcus and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/home-depot\/\" target=\"_blank\">Home Depot<\/a> for credit card and customer information. They\u2019ve burrowed into banks like <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/jp-morgan-chase\/\" target=\"_blank\">JPMorgan Chase<\/a>. Even tech companies can\u2019t seem to protect themselves. Yahoo\u2019s ineptitude in repelling (or even being aware of) hackers forced it to reduce its sale price to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/verizon\/\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon<\/a>. Google and Facebook recently fell victim to a hacker who conned their accountants into wiring him a total of more than $100 million. And OneLogin, a startup that bills itself as a secure password management service, recently lost certain customer data to hackers.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In one survey, 66% of security and I.T. professionals replied that they weren&#8217;t confident that their organization could recover from a cyberattack.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p4\">It\u2019s not like companies aren\u2019t trying to play defense. Accenture estimates that companies worldwide spent $84 billion in 2015 to protect against attacks. That spending is an acknowledgment that every company needs to safeguard its digital assets, which in turn requires knowing about the criminals that keep coming at them and what defenses they can build to minimize the damage.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>2. A new breed of criminal<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">Hacking is particularly frustrating for corporate executives who don\u2019t understand their enemy. Embezzlers or extortionists? Sure. But faceless gangs of nasty nerds? It\u2019s often harder for CEOs to wrap their brains around the motivation of their antagonists\u2014or their audacity. \u201cAt the C-level they feel violated,\u201d says Jay Leek, a venture capitalist pursuing cybersecurity investments and a former chief information security officer at private equity giant Blackstone. \u201cI witness this emotional \u2018What just happened?\u2019 You don\u2019t walk in physically to a company and violate it.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width aligncenter\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2067840\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" data-orig-size=\"4200,2800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Rebecca Greenfield&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1497571200&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;\\u00a9 Rebecca Greenfield 2016&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;35&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.00625&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"HAC.07.01.17\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683?w=1024\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2067840\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=2048&amp;h=1366 2048w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac07_nicolefriedlanderfinal.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"caption\">Nicole Friedlander, a New York lawyer specializing in cybercrime, says hackers collaborate more today and &#8220;no longer need all the skills to complete any particular crime.&#8221;<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Rebecca Greenfield for Fortune<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The brazenness Leek describes is a hallmark of hackers who\u2014despite their mystique in popular culture\u2014are basically everyday thieves, like bank robbers. Where hackers are different, however, is that they rarely meet in person. Instead, they convene in online forums on the \u201cdark web,\u201d an anonymous layer of the Internet that requires a special browser to access. Deep in the forums, crooks hatch hacking plots of all sorts: breaking into corporate databases or selling stolen Social Security numbers or purchasing inside information from unscrupulous employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Cybercriminals have proved adept at adopting successful corporate strategies of their own. A recent development has seen the cleverest crooks selling hacking tools to criminal small-fry. It\u2019s analogous to semiconductor companies licensing their technology to device manufacturers. According to a report from security software giant <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/symantec\/\" target=\"_blank\">Symantec<\/a>, gangs now offer so-called ransomware as a service, a trick that involves licensing software that freezes computer files until a company pays up. The gangs then take their cut for providing the license to their criminal customers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">If it weren\u2019t all blatantly illegal, the practices would be laudably corporate. \u201cCybercriminals no longer need all the skills to complete any particular crime,\u201d says Nicole Friedlander, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in charge of the key Southern District of New York\u2019s complex fraud and cybercrime unit. \u201cInstead, they can hire other cybercriminals online who have those skills and do it together.\u201d In that sense, hackers have become service providers like doctors or lawyers or anyone else, says Friedlander, who joined the New York office of law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell last year.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068789\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac_cost\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532\" data-orig-size=\"1220,634\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hac_cost\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows the average cost of a data breach since 2005&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2068789 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&#038;h=532\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=1024&amp;h=532 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=150&amp;h=78 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=300&amp;h=156 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png?w=768&amp;h=399 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But the bad guys aren\u2019t all freelancers.

Playing defense<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\">In early March, the information security team at ride-hailing giant Uber leaped into action: An Uber employee had reported a suspicious email message, and similar reports were flooding in from all over the company.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Uber\u2019s databases contain the email addresses and personal information of millions of riders around the world, making security a particularly pressing issue. And the company has had its share of problems as a caretaker of sensitive data. In 2014, Uber suffered a breach that exposed the insurance and driver\u2019s license information of tens of thousands of drivers; it took the mega-startup months to discover and investigate the incident and fully notify its drivers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As soon as the alarm was raised in March, Uber established an \u201cincident commander\u201d to manage the developing situation. The job of the incident commander\u2014a term of art in cybersecurity circles\u2014is to keep the company informed about potential attacks. It turned out that the attack was targeting users of Google\u2019s Gmail service, not Uber itself. But anyone with a Gmail address was vulnerable. Later that same day Google fixed the vulnerability in its Gmail service, allowing Uber\u2019s incident commander to stand down.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Uber\u2019s reaction is an example of the vigilance with which companies must treat the torrent of threats coming at them every day. John \u201cFour\u201d Flynn, a former Facebook executive who now is chief information security officer for Uber, says the key to cybersecurity incidents\u2014which he defines as everything from a data breach to a stolen laptop\u2014is to have a clear communication strategy. \u201cDuring an incident, the role of executives is to give support,\u201d says Flynn. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for confusion about who\u2019s in charge.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-default-width alignnone\"  ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068788\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac_cost_per_size\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483\" data-orig-size=\"1220,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hac_cost_per_size\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows the average cost of data breaches&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483?w=1024\" class=\"wp-image-2068788 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&#038;h=483\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=1024&amp;h=483 1024w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=150&amp;h=71 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=300&amp;h=142 300w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png?w=768&amp;h=363 768w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_cost_per_size.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Flynn has every right to sound confident in his authority. The chief information security officer, or CISO, is possibly the hottest job in the C-suite today. Cybercrime is so serious that these formerly little-known and unloved executives now typically have a direct line to boards of directors\u2014a big break from the past. Before, the CISO would report to the chief information officer, who was responsible for buying and operating computers, not obsessing over flies in the ointment. If the CISO sounded the alarm over a breach, too often he or she ended up being the one sacrificed to appease top management. \u201cIt was my job to tell my boss his baby was ugly,\u201d one former information security executive laments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These days, though, smart companies treat hacking threats like other existential risks to their business\u2014recessions, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters come to mind\u2014and plan accordingly. The CISO is pivotal in maintaining readiness. \u201cIf you\u2019re a <i>Fortune<\/i> 500 company, you already have a response,\u201d says Leek, the former executive at Blackstone, which had several portfolio companies that suffered breaches, including arts-and-crafts merchant Michaels Stores. \u201cBut people forget to take it out, blow the dust off, and recall: \u2018Let\u2019s do what we decided when we had a sound mind.\u2019 \u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Having a clear line of authority and a good action plan take a company only so far. At some point it has to call the cops, specifically the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the U.S. Secret Service. Both agencies have reach and power that allow them to take the fight to foreign cybercrooks. On several occasions, U.S. law enforcement agents working undercover on the dark web have managed to lure presumed offenders out of hiding with phony deals, and then had them apprehended in and extradited to the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>During the incident, the role of executives is to give support,&#8221; says Uber&#8217;s chief information officer. &#8220;There&#8217;s no room for confusion about who&#8217;s in charge.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Calling law enforcement has downsides, however. The likely outcome\u2014an investigation\u2014imposes burdens on the victim company in terms of money and time. And it increases the chance that sensitive details about the hack will leak publicly. That\u2019s why the best course of action is for companies to avoid FBI-level hacking incidents in the first place. A new, multibillion-dollar industry has sprung up to help.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>4. An industry is born<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The videoconference camera looked like any other. But unbeknownst to its corporate owner, the device was working overtime: Hackers had captured the microphone remotely and were using it to spy on every meeting that took place in the boardroom. The company, which does not want to be identified, finally got wise to the spying scheme thanks to Darktrace, a global cybersecurity company that uses artificial intelligence to detect aberrant activity on client networks. Darktrace CEO Nicole Eagan says her company noticed the camera had been gobbling abnormal amounts of data. This raised a red flag, enabling Darktrace to notify its client that something was amiss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Darktrace is just one of hundreds of firms that offer help to combat the hacking epidemic. Once a stodgy corner of enterprise software, cybersecurity has become a hot sector for venture capitalists. Investors put some $3.5 billion into a total of 404 security startups last year, according to New York research firm CB Insights. That\u2019s up from $1.8 billion for 279 investments in 2013.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-image-medium-width alignnone\" style=\"max-width:610px;\" ><a href=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2068786\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/hac_tactics\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340\" data-orig-size=\"610,340\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"hac_tactics\" data-image-description=\"&lt;p&gt;Chart shows tactics used in data breaches&lt;\/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340?w=610\" class=\"wp-image-2068786 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=610&#038;h=340\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"340\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png 610w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/06\/hac_tactics.png?w=300&amp;h=167 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><span class=\"credit\">Graphic by Nicolas Rapp<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p class=\"p4\">For executives, all of this entrepreneurial activity translates into a dizzying array of security options. There are newcomers like Tanium, for instance, which offers a service that lets companies see who is on their network. Publicly traded Palo Alto Networks makes a kind of intelligent firewall that uses machine learning to thwart intruders. There are also a host of niche security firms such as Area 1 (which specializes in defending against phishing scams) and Lookout (which is a mobile-phone-focused security service).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">With all of this firepower arrayed against it, how can cybercrime continue to grow so fast? One answer is that some of the glitzy defense systems don\u2019t work as advertised. Security insiders grumble about firms bamboozling clients with \u201cblinky lights\u201d in order to sell \u201cscareware\u201d\u2014software that plays to customers\u2019 insecurities but doesn\u2019t protect them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\">At the end of the day, though, humans are as much to blame as software. \u201cThe weak underbelly of security is not tech failure but poor process implementation or social engineering,\u201d says Asheem Chandna, an investor with Greylock Partners and a Palo Alto Networks director. Chandna notes that most hacking attacks come about in two ways, neither of which involves a high level of technical sophistication: An employee clicks on a booby-trapped link or attachment\u2014perhaps in an email that appears to be from her boss\u2014or someone steals an employee\u2019s log-in credentials and gets access to the company network.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">While cyberdefense tools can mitigate such attacks, some will always succeed. Humans are curious creatures and, in a big organization, there will always be someone who clicks on a message like, \u201cUh-oh. Did you see these pictures of you from the office party?\u201d When it comes to hacking, a penny of offense can defeat a dollar\u2019s worth of defense.

As <em>Fortune<\/em> explains <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/cybersecurity-business-fights-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in the cover story of our Jul. 1 issue<\/a>, today the biggest and baddest hacker groups are backed by nation-states. They\u2019re called \u201cadvanced persistent threats\u201d or APTs, in the cyber jargon, a phrase meant to convey their supreme and underlying quality: ferocity. Below are a few of the most notorious\u2014and feared\u2014state-affiliated hacking groups around. (Links to specific hacks below are based on leading theories put forward by top computer forensic firms.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Fancy Bear<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b> (a.k.a. Sofacy, Pawn Storm) \/ <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s2\"><b>Cozy Bear <\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. CozyDuke, Office Monkeys)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Rival agencies in the Russian spy services, the two \u201cBears\u201d were thrust into the spotlight during <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/14\/russians-hacking-39-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election<\/a> for their roles in allegedly breaching the Democratic National Committee\u2019s system. Fancy Bear, which comes out of the GRU, Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, has been meddling in European elections since then. Cozy Bear, which represents the FSB, Russia\u2019s successor to the Soviet-era KGB, has hit U.S. think tanks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Lazarus Group<\/b> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. DarkSeoul, Guardians of Peace)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\">Widely believed to be associated with North Korea, this gang refuses to die. Lazarus got its start by pummeling American and South \u00adKorean websites with denial-of-\u00adservice attacks in 2009. Five years later, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/sony-hack-part-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it perpetrated a massive hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment<\/a>. In 2016, Lazarus stole $81 million in a heist targeting Bangladesh\u2019s central bank and the SWIFT financial network. And it has <span class=\"s1\">been linked to the \u00adWannaCry<\/span> ransomware worm that ground businesses around the globe to a halt in May.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Equation Group<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\">This is the nickname given by Russian antivirus firm Kaspersky to a team believed to be associated with the U.S. National Security Agency\u2014specifically the NSA\u2019s Tailored Access Operations unit, or TAO. They\u2019re the good guys, right? Not in everyone\u2019s eyes. Many experts believe the Equation Group successfully attacked Iran\u2019s nuclear program in the mid-aughts. But recently a selection of the squad\u2019s hacking tools were stolen and leaked by the Shadow Brokers, another mysterious hacker group (believed to be Russia-affiliated), and are now being used to cause mayhem<span class=\"s1\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Comment Crew<\/b> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. APT1, Shanghai Group)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">China sponsors a plethora of hacking groups. One of the most notorious, believed to be part of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, came to be known as Comment Crew for its habit of hiding comments on web pages. Exposed by forensic investigators at Mandiant, the group has been linked to intrusions at big name companies such as <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"ko\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/coca-cola\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">ko<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> , RSA, and <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/lockheed-martin\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lockheed Martin<\/a> <span class=\"tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral\" data-symbol=\"lmt\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wrapper trend-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"exit_trigger_set\" href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/fortune500\/lockheed-martin\/\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"ticker\">lmt<\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"change percent\"><\/span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/span> . Chinese industrial espionage has been on the decline since former U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to cool it on the cyber front last year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Sandworm<\/b> <\/span><span class=\"s1\"><b>(a.k.a. Electrum)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Named for allusions to the sci-fi classic <i>Dune<\/i> found in its code, Sandworm is another group believed to be associated with the Russians. The crew has hacked people affiliated with NATO and the Ukrainian government, presumably to gather intelligence. Sandworm is also known for breaking into companies that deal with critical infrastructure. Last year the group shut down a power grid in Ukraine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously associated APT1\/Comment Crew with Operation Aurora, an attack

These brick-and-mortar locations instantly give it a national \u00adphysical presence, as well as a network of mini distribution centers for fresh produce\u2014by far the most challenging part of the grocery delivery business because of spoilage and the fragility of fruits and vegetables. (Upon news of the bid, <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/16\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-stock\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grocery stocks took a nosedive<\/a> accordingly.)<\/p>\n<p>But Amazon isn\u2019t just trying to change how we buy groceries. Remember the company\u2019s original disruption: bookselling. Jeff Bezos not only shifted how and where books were sold; he also changed how they were made, by forcing publishers, authors, and everybody else along the book supply chain to cut their costs. The same thing could very well happen in food, and the outcome for food manufacturers could be as dire it was for book publishers. \u201cI would be terrified if I were a consumer packaged-goods company right now,\u201d says Benzi Ronen, CEO and founder of food hub management software startup Farmigo. Indeed, packaged-goods producers\u2019 businesses are already under stress, with manufactured-food volumes at large companies declining 4% this year, as consumers seek out less-processed fare.

This is not your mother\u2019s generic box of cornflakes, with its bad design and perceived quality issues. A Piper Jaffray survey last spring found that 365 is customers\u2019 favorite organic-food brand, ahead of premium names like Kellogg\u2019s-owned Kashi and General Mills\u2019 Annie\u2019s. The 365 brand is virtually unavailable online, but that will change if Amazon is smart about it. \u201cThe opportunity to use the 365 brand as a mainstay of their online offering is really profound,\u201d says Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard. \u201cIt puts a huge amount of pressure on branded food sales.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amazon has tried to develop its own private label in food for years. In 2016 it rolled out its Happy Belly coffee, Mama Bear baby food, and Wickedly Prime snacks. These brands are available only to Amazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year for free two-day shipping, among a litany of other benefits. In a sign of how powerful its private label can be, analytics company 1010data found that for a 12-month period ending last year, 94% of all batteries sold online went through Amazon sites, and Amazon\u2019s own brand made up about a third of all online battery sales. Its Amazon Elements baby wipes, introduced in 2014, have managed to capture 16% of online market share, despite being available only to Prime members.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon and Whole Foods might seem like they are on opposite ends of the retail spectrum\u2014a relatively small, high-end grocer vs. the massive e-commerce Everything Store\u2014but they overlap in the power of their brands. That\u2019s a rarity for a purveyor of food. Under the old model of food retailing, \u201cthe brand you trusted was the manufacturer,\u201d Ronen says. \u201cToday you go onto Amazon and filter everything by what\u2019s Prime.\u201d Similarly, Whole Foods acts as a curator for shoppers by banning ingredients like saccharin and bleached flour from the products it sells. Together, the two trusted brands should create an even more powerful one. That could fundamentally alter the way grocery aisles look\u2014and even make the aisles themselves obsolete.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the Jul. 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;The Deal That Made an Industry Shudder.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 22, 2017","published":"2017-06-22 08:00:12","updated":"2017-06-22 08:00:12","minute":"8:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-disruption\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-disruption\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/amazon-buying-whole-foods-disruption\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"14\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5473976997001-14\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5473976997001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2tOggay\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/retail_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Damazon%2Cfood%2Cretail%2Cwholefoods%26ch%3Dretail%26topic%3Dwholefoods&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>The deal that made an industry shudder.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"381326","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/beth-kowitt\/","name":"Beth Kowitt","twitter":"bethkowitt","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1599149\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/kowitt\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Beth Kowitt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/03\/kowitt.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Beth Kowitt is a senior writer at Fortune Magazine, where she covers food and agriculture, consumer behavior, and sustainability.

But it could also herald a new chapter for Silicon Valley itself. The age of so-called startup unicorns has had its share of meltdowns, including onetime blood-\u00adtesting darling Theranos and insurance software notable Zenefits. But Uber is different: It\u2019s the largest, most valuable, most global, most disruptive, most quintessential Silicon Valley success story.<\/p>\n<p>Kalanick\u2019s departure <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-why-it-matter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has the potential to affect<\/a> the way local regulators view disruptive startups that operate in legal gray areas, the way labor regulators look at Silicon Valley workplaces, and the way securities regulators view low-information startup stock sales. (Before, Uber was \u201ccontroversial.\u201d Now its bad behavior could serve as justification for tighter regulation.)<\/p>\n<p>Uber\u2019s moment of truth could also <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">influence startup valuations<\/a> and the way investors assess risk for companies with founder-controlled boards. It could affect the kinds of executives that want to leave cushy jobs in mainstream sectors to become \u201cthe adult\u201d at Silicon Valley startups. And it could deter would-be entrepreneurs who might otherwise have been seduced by the cult of personality surrounding unicorn CEOs.<\/p>\n<p>This wake-up call for the tech industry has been <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/21\/uber-controversy-timeline-travis-kalanick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at least six months in the making<\/a>. Uber was not the only company with a reportedly toxic culture, an obsession with disruption over following the rules, and a win-at-any-cost strategy; it was just the most successful. Because those characteristics had worked so well, others emulated the formula. Scores of \u201cUber for X\u201d companies hoping to re-create its success may now be rethinking their plans. Uber\u2019s story is no longer a playbook. It\u2019s a cautionary tale.<\/p>\n<p><em>A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2017 issue of Fortune with the headline &#8220;What Uber Means for the Valley.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n","time":{"pretty":"June 22, 2017","published":"2017-06-22 09:00:24","updated":"2017-06-22 09:00:24","minute":"9:00 AM EDT","is_same_day":false,"is_home_pop":false},"comment_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning-tech\/","absolute_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning-tech\/","redirect_url":"","partner":"","outbrain_url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/06\/22\/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resignation-meaning-tech\/","outbrain_footer":true,"outbrain_right_rail":true,"short_title":"","post_type":"post","featured_type":"video","featured_video":{"html":"<div class=\"video-wrapper\"  data-ratio=\"1\" data-pos=\"15\">\n\t\t\t\t<object id=\"bc-video-5478989294001-15\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#FFFFFF\"\/><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"\/><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"3160175193001\"\/><param name=\"playerKey\" value=\"AQ~~,AAAB668kGak~,LMlvL4u4ShOTHD9z00VquajMOcH97tcW\"\/><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"seamlessTabbing\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"swliveconnect\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"autoStart\" value=\"false\"\/><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"5478989294001\"\/><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/for.tn\/2rRVj23\"\/><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"\/><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateLoad\"\/><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Fortune_onTemplateReady\"\/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"\/><param name=\"adServerURL\" value=\"http:\/\/pubads.g.doubleclick.net\/gampad\/ads?env=vp&#038;gdfp_req=1&#038;impl=s&#038;output=xml_vast2&#038;iu=\/8484\/fort\/video_bc\/leadership_bc&#038;sz=1000x1&#038;cust_params=tags%3Duber%26ch%3Dleadership%26topic%3Duber&#038;unviewed_position_start=1&#038;correlator=%5Btimestamp%5D\"\/><\/object>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n\t\t\t\tbrightcove.createExperiences();\n\t\t\t<\/script>","featured_image":"","class":"featured-vid-article_full","caption":""},"excerpt":"<p>His resignation will have wide-ranging repercussions for startup culture, regulation, and more.<\/p>\n","authors":[{"id":"273114","url":"http:\/\/fortune.com\/author\/erin-griffith\/","name":"Erin Griffith","twitter":"eringriffith","gplus":"","email":"","thumbnail":"<img width=\"59\" height=\"59\" src=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=59\" class=\"avatar avatar-59 photo wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=59 59w, https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=118 118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 59px) 100vw, 59px\" data-attachment-id=\"1602497\" data-permalink=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/?attachment_id=1602497\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png\" data-orig-size=\"200,200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"BETA HEADSHOTS 2016 \u2014 Erin Griffith\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=200\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=200\" \/>","thumbnail_alt":"","thumbnail_src":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/05\/eringriffith.png?w=150",150,150,true],"bio":"Erin Griffith is a senior writer.
