<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Pornography can be one of the delights of life: it can be arousing,
it can be fun figuring out what kinds you like, it can sometimes be a
way for partners to get ideas for things they might like to try
together, and some of it is good for a laugh. Pornography can enhance
masturbation, and masturbation can be used to either learn to reach
orgasm more easily or to learn greater orgasmic control.</P>

<P>The problem is that not all porn is well-done.  And, unlike
mainstream movies and books, typically neither your morning newspaper
nor everyday conversation will point you towards the better stuff. As
such our hope is that the following guide saves you time.</P>

<P>This guide is divided into separate sections for erotic <a 
href="#videos">videos</a>, <a href="#books">books</a>, <a 
href="#comics">comics</a>, and <a href="#audio">audio recordings</a>.</P>

<HR>

<H2><a name="videos">Videos</a></H2>

<P><B>How to select and watch adult videos...</B></P>

<OL>
<LI>Once you've found a favorite video, try others created by the same director, or featuring the same performer.
<LI>Fast forward through anything that turns you off or bores you.
<LI>It's traditional in heterosexual videos for each sex scene to end with the male actor pulling out and ejaculating somewhere on the outside of his partner's body, rather than internally.  Some viewers find this annoying, but at this time it's unfortunately hard to avoid, except via all-female videos or the fast-forward button.
<LI>Check your DVD player's instruction manual to see if it has a "point A to point B" feature, in case you find a section you particularly like.
</OL>

<P><B>How to rent adult videos...</B></P>

<P>For most people, rent-by-mail or video on demand will be the most comfortable and
convenient way to rent adult videos.  As it stands <a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/HomeHomePage.aspx?partner_id=76418703">AdultDVDEmpire</a>
appears to offer the widest selection of both, and we were pleased with the
quality of their service the time we tried it.  All links below are to
the AdultDVDEmpire rental page for that title.</P>

<P><B>Het videos which may be good choices for couples</B></P>

<UL>

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=580851&partner_id=76418703">Beautiful</a>
(directed by Michael Raven, and featuring Julia Ann - note: this
award-winning film has excellent production values and solid acting, as
such it may be a perfect place to start)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=478954&partner_id=76418703">One Size Fits All</a>
(directed by Candida Royale - notes: "softer" than almost any other het
videos you're likely to find, and the fourth of the five sections of
this film is probably the best of the bunch)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=444375&partner_id=76418703">Eyes
of Desire 2</a> (directed by Candida Royale - note: a bit edgier than
<I>One Size Fits All</I> but still relatively soft by industry
standards)

</UL>

<P><B>Het videos with a more "artistic" or "serious" edge</B></P>

<UL>

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=50467&partner_id=76418703">Club Sin</a>
(directed by Antonio Passolini, featuring Ashlyn Gere and Chloe, and
involving an intriguing female-dominant plot)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=465554&partner_id=76418703">Fashionistas</a>
(fetish/BDSM focus, a bit edgier than most other films mentioned here)

</UL>


<P><B>Het videos focusing on the best scenes from just one
actress</B></P>

<P><I>Note: These "Deep Inside" films often features scenes with unusual
amounts of chemistry, or scenes with the actresses' real-life partners,
since the actress is picking their favorite scenes.</I></P>

<UL>

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=50466&partner_id=76418703">Deep Inside Chloe</a>
(an extremely popular and enthusiastic performer with an all-natural
body, and a favorite of many men and women who have seen a lot of
videos, as well as of critics - this film in particular featured some
interesting commentary from Chloe about her films and career)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=697728&partner_id=76418703">Deep
Inside Nina Hartley</a> (a particularly articulate and outspoken
proponent of first ammendment rights, in addition to being a very
popular performer, this is the same Nina Hartley who created the "Nina
Hartley's Guides" series of educational tapes)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=50727&partner_id=76418703">Deep Inside Jill Kelly</a>
(directed by Veronica Hart, and containing several scenes of Jill
performing with real-life partners)

</UL>

<P><B>Het "all-sex" or "gonzo" series</B></P>

<P><I>Note: "gonzo" indicates an informal filming style, with the person
behind the camera becoming a part of the film.  They're often a lot of
fun, with sex that's a bit more real and less staged, even if production
budgets are lower.  A good strategy is to sample one film from each
series until you find a series whose director you like.</I></P>

<UL>

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/SearchTitlesPage.aspx?media_id=0&searchstring=Shane's%20World&refine=102_Performers_1566_Shane&partner_id=76418703">The Shane's World Series</a> (Shane's films - particularly some of the earlier ones - tend to be very lighthearted and fun.  The "Shane's World" and "College Invasion"
series are her mixed-gender series, while her "Slumber Party" series is her
all-female series)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=467396&partner_id=76418703">Amateur Angels No. 7</a>
(by Luc Wylder, a popular place to start)

</UL>

<P><B>Het videos featuring an all-female cast</B></P>

<P><I>Note: "all-female" doesn't necessarily mean "lesbian" - basically 
all of the films in this section were still created primarily with a 
heterosexual male audience in mind.  There do exist films made by and for 
a lesbian audience (for example those created by <a 
href="http://www.imdb.com/company/co0047255/">S.I.R. Video</a>), but 
unfortunately AdultDVDEmpire doesn't carry any of them at this time, and I 
don't currently know any other way to rent them by mail.  For this kind of 
film you'll need to purchase rather than rent, in other words.</I></P>

<UL>

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/SearchTitlesPage.aspx?media_id=0&searchstring=Shane's%20World&refine=102_Performers_1566_Shane&partner_id=76418703">The Slumber Party Series</a> (directed by Shane - films in this series are a good place to start)

<LI><a
href="http://www.adultdvdempire.com/itempage.aspx?item_id=471499&partner_id=76418703">Wide Open Spaces</a>
(directed by Wesley Emerson, and featuring Kelly O'Dell and Nina
Hartley)

</UL>

<P><B>Bisexual</B></P>

<P><I>Note: Essentially all het videos will feature at least one scene 
with two women - the term "bisexual" when applied to adult videos simply 
means that the men will have sex with each other as well.</I></P>

<UL>

<LI><a

Bi Now Pay Later</a>

</UL>



<P><B>Gay</B></P>

<P>It's hard to go wrong when picking a film directed by the the famed Chi 
Chi LaRue.  Another option is to use <a 
href="http://www.gayvnawards.com">www.gayvnawards.com</a> to find last 
year's award winners.</P>

<P>For men-only videos featuring serious BDSM play, those offered by <a
href="http://www.shotgunvideo.com">Shotgun Video</a> (although quite extreme)
are some of the best-regarded.</P>

<P><B>For additional suggestions and reviews...</B></P>

<P>See either <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573441724/ref=nosim/societyforhumans"><I>The
Ultimate Guide to Adult Videos</I></a>, or the
more recent <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/157344247X/ref=nosim/societyforhumans"><I>The
Smart Girl's Guide to Porn</I></a>, both by Violet Blue.</P>

<P><B>If you're watching with your partner...</B></P>

<P>Here are a few ideas, based on suggestions from Violet Blue's
book:</B>

<P><B><I>For waiting until after the film to have sex:</I></B> Don't be
surprised if the sex is hotter than normal, even if the film isn't that
great - just leave the remote within easy reach so that either of you
can fast forward through ny material which turns him or her off. 
Another alternative (frustrating but in a fun way) is to watch the
entire film without touching yourselves or each other, and when the
video is over to write down a list of your favorite parts, or things you
wish you'd seen in the film, and later on swap your lists for play.

<P><B><I>For having sex while watching the film:</I></B> One easy way to
do this is watch the film with your hands in each other's laps, under a
blanket: this can be especially hot if you make a "rule" that you can
only touch each other, but not yourselves.  On the other hand, if
intercourse is what you'll prefer, then one possibility is for one
partner to straddle the other while facing the TV, and another
possibility is doggie-style facing the TV (particularly comfortable if
the receiving partner has some big pillows to lie on, so their weight
isn't all on their arms).  Of course, you can also take turns giving
each other oral sex, while the receiving partner watches.

<P>If you prefer your erotica in the form of the written word, then you're 
in luck: you'll find a wider range of material, and often higher quality 
material, than in almost any other genre of porn.</P>

<H2><a name="comics">Comics</a></H2>

<P>Right now the three best erotic comic artists are Phil Foglio, Colleen 
Coover, and Michael Manning: it's all fantastic stuff, and the all-time 
favorites of many.</P>

<P>Basically, you'd probably prefer Phil Foglio's pansexual work (<I><a 
href="http://www.studiofoglio.com/xeno.html">XXXenophile</a></I>) or 
Colleen Coover's all-female work (<I><a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1560975199/ref=nosim/societyforhumans">Small 
Favors</a></I>) if you want something sexy and lighthearted, and you'd 
probably prefer Michael Manning's work (<a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1561631671/ref=nosim/societyforhumans"><I>Hydrophidian</I></a>, 
<a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1561633569/ref=nosim/societyforhumans"><I>In

if you want something more stylized and exotic.</P>

<HR>

<H2><a name="audio">Audio Recordings</a></H2>

<P>We hope this form of erotica grows in popularity, because it's a lot of 
fun. As it stands one of the best examples of audio CD's featuring the 
sounds of real-life sex is <a 
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WFWF/ref=nosim/societyforhumans"><I>Encounters 
Erotica</I></a>. Also, a company called Passion Press specializes in 
producing recordings of actors reading erotic stories: if that sounds like 
the kind of thing you'd enjoy, then you'll be pleased to learn audible.com 
carries several Passion Press titles.  If you're not sure whether this is 
the sort of thing you'd enjoy then you might want to check out Violet 
Blue's free podcast <a href="http://www.tinynibbles.com/listen">Open 
Source Sex</a>, which in addition to interesting news, sex tips, reviews, 
and interviews, also features readings of short stories by leading erotic 
authors (of the early episodes the ones to try are 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 if 
you're interested in stories rather than interviews or news).</P>
