Using the Services</p>\n<p>A. How To Use The Service</p>\n<p>To initiate a Transfer, you must enter the required information at the Website.</p>\n<p>B. Purpose for Using the Services</p>\n<p>You agree to use the Services only for bona fide and lawful purposes. You may not use the Services to conduct gambling activities or any illegal activity. MoneyGram has the right to terminate your Profile and to refuse to process (or may reverse) any Transfer if it believes, in its sole discretion, you are using a Service for any illegal or improper purpose, or if: (a) any Transfer exceeds the available funds on deposit in your Bank Account or Debit Card Account or, if applicable, available line of credit under your Credit Card Account; (b) we have reason to believe any Transfer may not be authorized by you; (c) any Transfer involves funds subject to a hold, dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal from the Bank Account or Debit Card Account; (d) any Transfer would violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Service, you or the financial institution where your Bank Account, Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account is held; (e) any Transfer is not in accordance with any other requirement stated in this Agreement or any of our policies, procedures or practices; or (f) for our protection or yours, we have reasonable cause not to process a Transfer request.

Limitations on Your Bank Account</p>\n<p>Please be aware that certain types of financial institution accounts have limits on the number of Transfers or withdrawals that may be made per month, and therefore may refuse to process Transfers that exceed such limits. Accordingly, we recommend that you check with your financial institution to determine what limitations are imposed on withdrawals from your Bank Account. If we are not able to debit the amount your Bank Account required to cover a Transfer (including any applicable Consumer Fee), we will not be able to complete the Transfer and will not be held liable for any costs, damages, etc., caused by such failure. We have no obligation to try to debit a Bank Account for a specific requested Money Transfer more than once.</p>\n<p>E. Business Days</p>\n<p>MoneyGram business days are Monday through Friday, excluding banking holidays in the United States. Please note that holiday observance in Receiver's countries may affect the Receiver's ability to collect a Transfer.</p>\n<p>6. Paying for the Services</p>\n<p>A. Fees</p>\n<p>Prior to sending a Transfer, you can estimate all applicable fees, including the Consumer Fee, by using the \"Estimator\" on the Website. See Section 7, below, for information regarding currency exchange fees. The fees and charges we assess to your Bank Account, Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account, as applicable, also will be reflected in the information screen that we will make available to you upon your initiation of each Transfer. After your Transfer is sent, please save the Receipt to your local hard drive for your records and/or print out a copy of the Receipt. The financial institution that holds your Bank Account, Debit Card or Credit Card Account may impose fees in connection with your purchase of a Service. Fees imposed by your financial institution or by any other person not directly a party to the Transfer, such as the Receiver's financial institution, will not be reflected on the Receipt for your Transfer. If you are paying for a Transfer by debit to your Bank Account or Debit Card Account and there are insufficient funds in your Bank Account or Debit Card Account, you may be subject to an additional $25.00 fee.</p>\n<p>B. Paying for an MoneyGramOnline Money Transfer Online</p>\n<p>You can pay for a MoneyGramOnline Money Transfer, including the Transfer Amount and any applicable fees, including the Consumer Fee, and charges by instructing MoneyGram to charge against your Credit Card Account. The maximum Transfer Amount that can be charged against your Credit Card Account is $899.99 per Transfer. You can also pay with an ACH debit of your Bank Account or debit of your Debit Card Account, including the Transfer Amount and any applicable fees (including the Consumer Fee).</p>\n<p>C. Paying for an ExpressPayment Transfer Online</p>\n<p>You can pay for an ExpressPayment Transfer, including the Transfer Amount and applicable fees, including the Consumer Fee, and charges by instructing MoneyGram to charge against your Credit Card Account.</p>\n<p>D. Payment Authorization</p>\n<p>For each Transfer you initiate for payment online, you authorize MoneyGram (or any party authorized by MoneyGram) to debit from your Bank Account or Debit Card Account, as applicable, or charge against your Credit Card Account for the Transfer Amount you enter, plus any applicable fees, including the Consumer Fee, and charges. Whether the Transfer is made by debit of your Bank Account or Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account, the funds or credit, as applicable, must be available in the account from which the Transfer is made. Please be sure funds or credit is available in that account before you initiate a Transfer. When you authorize a Transfer, you are authorizing MoneyGram (and any party authorized by MoneyGram) to take the funds from your Bank Account or debit Card Account or charge against your Credit Card Account (as applicable) in the amount of the Transfer Amount plus any applicable fees, including the Consumer Fee, and charges. If paying by Credit Card Account, your Credit Card Account will be charged as soon as MoneyGram accepts your request for the Transfer.</p>\n<p>E. Obligation To Have Sufficient Funds or Credit</p>\n<p>MoneyGram shall have no obligation to effect a Transfer unless sufficient funds are available in your Bank Account, Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account, as applicable, and neither MoneyGram nor any Service Provider shall have any liability if a Transfer is not effected as a result of the unavailability of sufficient funds or credit. MoneyGram may resubmit for collection any ACH debit authorized by you that is returned to it for any reason. You are responsible if MoneyGram makes a Transfer you request and, for any reason, MoneyGram is unable to collect the funds from your Bank Account, Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account (as applicable), is later reversed. In addition, any Transfer sent by MoneyGram without sufficient funds or credit available or without financial institution approval shall not create any obligation on the part of MoneyGram to make any such Transfer now or in the future. If you are paying for a Transfer by debit to your Bank Account or Debit Card Account and there are insufficient funds in your Bank Account or Debit Card Account, you will be subject to an additional $25.00 fee.</p>\n<p>F. Cutoff Hours</p>\n<p>If we receive instructions to initiate a ACH Transfer from you on or before 5:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on a business day, we will attempt to debit the funds from your Bank Account. Cutoff hours are not applicable if you initiate a Transfer with your Debit or Credit Card as MoneyGram has the ability to charge your Debit or Credit Card 24 hours a day. .</p>\n<p>7. Currency Exchange</p>\n<p>A. Exchange Rate Expense</p>\n<p>In addition to the Consumer Fee or other fees applicable to the Transfer, a currency exchange rate set by MoneyGram or its Representatives may be applied. Any difference between the rate applied to the Transfer and the rate received by MoneyGram or its Representatives will be kept by MoneyGram or its Representatives.</p>\n<p>B. Exchange Rate</p>\n<p>The Receive Amount and Exchange Rate shown on the Receipt are valid for 45 days from the date the Transfer is sent, UNLESS otherwise specified by law. In such case or after 45 days have elapsed, an estimated Exchange Rate will be applied.</p>\n<p>C. Estimated Exchange Rate</p>\n<p>If a Transfer is subject to an estimated Exchange Rate, the rate of exchange for the Transfer will be set at the time the Receiver collects the funds in the Receiving Country. The actual exchange rate may be affected by political, economic and other conditions in the Receiving Country. Representatives within a country may not apply a uniform currency exchange rate and, as such, the currency exchange rate may vary based upon the Location selected by Receiver and may materially vary from the Exchange Rate stated on your Receipt.</p>\n<p>D. Unique Pay-Out Currency</p>\n<p>If the Receiver requests that the Transfer be paid in a currency other than the currency in which the Location normally pays out, the Representative (if it is willing to pay out in the requested currency) may charge an exchange fee. This exchange is a separate transaction between the Receiver and the Representative, and is not a part of the Transfer. Use the \"Estimator\" on the Website to learn what currencies are available in the country you have selected.</p>\n<p>8. Receiving a MoneyGramOnline Money Transfer</p>\n<p>A. Availability</p>\n<p>A Transfer made in conjunction with the initial application for a Profile will be delayed until your identity and funding information has been fully confirmed by MoneyGram. Thereafter, the Receive Amount can usually be received at a MoneyGram Location within ten (10) minutes (when using MoneyGram Online Same Day Service) after the Transfer was sent, subject to the hours of operation of the Location selected by the Receiver and other terms contained in this Agreement. A Transfer may only be picked up by a Receiver in the country designated by the Sender. A country may not include its territories. If using our Economy Service, your Receiver cannot pick up the Transfer until MoneyGram has received good funds. MoneyGram will usually receive good funds on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date your Transfer request is completed, provided that occurs before 5:00 PM CST. As usual, your Receiver's ability to pick up a Transfer is also subject to the hours of operation of the Location selected by the Receiver and other terms contained in this Agreement. The Receiver can call 1-800-MONEYGRAM or refer to the Website for the address and phone number of Locations. For Transfers sent to a physical address, a bank account or an electronic device (where available, check Website for availability), the Receive Amount will be subject to the delivery schedule and hours of operation of the Service Provider delivering the Transfer. A Receiver's ability to receive any Transfer may be restricted until any identity verification of the Sender or Receiver required by MoneyGram has been successfully completed and the availability of funds or credit line (as applicable) has been confirmed. In addition, due to circumstances beyond the control of MoneyGram such as exchange control regulations of the receiving country, Transfers to certain destinations may be subject to delay or to restrictions imposed under the laws of the receiving country. Please note that holiday observance in the receiving country may affect a Receiver's ability to collect Transfers.</p>\n<p>B. Pay-out Information</p>\n<p>MoneyGramOnline Money Transfers will be paid out in cash, check, money order, MoneyGram Money Transfer Check, or to a bank account or electronic device, or a combination thereof, if available. If the Receive Amount stated on the receipt is different than the amount actually received by your Receiver, please contact us at 1-800-689-8307 or email us through the \"Contact Us\" link on our Website at www.moneygram.com/wps/portal/moneygramonline. The financial institution that holds your Bank Account or Debit Card or Credit Card Account may impose fees in connection with your purchase of a Service. Fees imposed by your financial institution or by any other person not directly a party to the Transfer, such as the Receiver's financial institution, will not be reflected on the Receipt form for your Transfer.</p>\n<p>C. Receiver Identification</p>\n<p>Please be aware that a Reference Number and/or presentation of proof of identification isn't required for every Receive in every country. You should use caution when sending to Receivers you do not know.</p>\n<p>9. Receiving an ExpressPayment Transaction</p>\n<p>MoneyGram will usually make information concerning your payment available to the Biller within ten (10) minutes after MoneyGram's receipt of your payment on business days. If your Transfer occurs after 11:00 PM CST notice will not be made available to your Biller until the next business day. MoneyGram has no control whatsoever over the time the Biller credits the payment to your account. Posting time will vary from Biller to Biller. Check with your Biller for payment posting times. If it is important that your Biller receive same day notice of your payment please go to a MoneyGram Location. Notice of ExpressPayment transfer payments made at a MoneyGram Location can usually be made available to your Biller within ten (10) minutes after your payment is made.</p>\n<p>10. Economy Service</p>\n<p>Economy Service is a variation on the standard MoneyGramOnline Money Transfer Service. The Terms and Conditions applicable to Economy Service differ from the MoneyGramOnline Same Day Money Transfer Service as follows:</p>\n<p>A. A Transfer will not be made available to your Receiver (or the Delivery Service Provider, if applicable) until MoneyGram has received good funds. Generally, the earliest date good funds will be available to MoneyGram is three (3) Business Days after you have initiated the Transfer, provided that occurs before 4:00 PM CST.</p>\n<p>B. You can only pay for Economy Service with an ACH debit of your Bank Account. You cannot use Economy Service to pay for an ExpressPayment Transfer.</p>\n<p>11. Payment Cancellations; Refunds</p>\n<p>To cancel a Transfer or request a refund contact the MoneyGramOnline Electronic Operations Center through the Website or via phone at 1-800-689-8307. You cannot cancel a Transfer or request a refund after the Receive Amount has been disbursed to the Receiver or disbursed to a delivering Service Provider, as applicable. Except as required by law, MoneyGram will not be responsible or liable to you or any other person for its failure, for any reason, to cancel a Transfer. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement or as required by law, if you ask us to terminate a Transfer or your service, or your Bank Account is closed for any reason, you will remain liable for previously authorized Transfers.</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances you may be eligible for a refund. To request a refund, please contact the MoneyGramOnline Electronic Operations Center through the Website or mail your written request to: MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc., ATTN: MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc. MoneyGram Online, MBC-1500, PO BOX 1424, Minneapolis, MN 55480-1424. The following information is required to process a refund request: name, user ID, reference number and the date of the Transfer.

If MoneyGram determines that funds have not been delivered due solely to MoneyGram's or our Representative's fault, both the Transfer Amount and the Consumer Fee will be refunded in U.S. dollars. If MoneyGram determines that you entitled to a refund for any other reason, only the Transfer Amount will be refunded, unless otherwise specified by applicable law. If MoneyGram determines that you are entitled to a refund, it will be credited to your original funding source (which may be your Bank Account, Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account, as applicable). You will receive notification if MoneyGram determines that you are not entitled to a refund.

Handling Disputes with a Receiver or Biller</p>\n<p>A Transfer cannot be reversed or canceled after the Receive Amount has been disbursed. If you have a dispute with a Biller or a Receiver regarding a Transfer for which a Service was used to make payment, you should contact the other party directly to resolve the problem. For example, if you are involved in a dispute as to an amount owed, the quantity or quality of goods or services purchased, whether or not the goods or services conform to an order or warranty, whether or not goods or services have been delivered or performed, or any other aspect of your relationship with a Receiver or Biller, you agree to pursue any such claim directly with the Receiver or Biller. You should contact your credit card or debit card issuer as soon as possible to preserve any dispute rights you may have with such issuer. If MoneyGram receives complaints about you or a Receiver to whom you have sent funds, your Profile may be closed, among other things, as provided below. To the extent allowed by law, you agree that neither MoneyGram nor any Service Provider will be responsible or liable in any manner for any claims that you may have, or any claims made against you by any person, arising out of any dispute between you and a Receiver or Biller.</p>\n<p>13.

Your Other Financial Obligations</p>\n<p>To the extent allowed by law, MoneyGram also has the right to collect from you the amount of any uncollected or reversed Transfer, plus any fees assessed and collection expenses, court costs and attorneys fees. To the extent allowed by law, you agree to hold MoneyGram harmless from any losses, costs, expenses or damages it may incur in connection with collecting for any Transfer or in defending any of the foregoing actions, including court costs and attorneys fees. You may be reported to a collection agency or credit bureau if you do not pay for any Transfer or Consumer Fee you have authorized in accordance with this agreement. You authorize MoneyGram to debit your Bank Account or Debit Card Account and/or charge against your Credit Card Account for any amounts owing to MoneyGram described in this section.</p>\n<p>15. Your Obligation to Provide Complete and Accurate Information</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant that all information you provide to MoneyGram, including but not limited to your Profile information and all data entered in connection with any Transfer or other transaction, will be complete and accurate in all respects. MoneyGram is entitled to rely on any information you provide and you agree to update your information if it changes. MoneyGram also reserves the right to take steps to verify the information you provide, although it is not required to do so. You authorize MoneyGram to obtain consumer reports on you to evaluate your application for monitoring or collection purposes, or for any other lawful purpose. If MoneyGram is unable to verify the information you provide, your application for a Profile may be rejected. IF YOU PROVIDE FALSE INFORMATION, YOUR PROFILE MAY BE TERMINATED AND ANY PENDING TRANSFERS MAY BE CANCELLED. IN ADDITION, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.</p>\n<p>16. Your Representations</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant in connection with any Transfer that (a) the Transfer information, including information about the Receiver and Biller, is accurate, (b) your Credit Card Account, Debit Card Account or Bank Account, as applicable, has sufficient funds or credit, as applicable, to make the Transfer, (c) the Transfer is lawful, and (d) the Transfer complies with the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>17. Password Protection</p>\n<p>You must use your User ID and Password to initiate a Transfer. You agree that your Password has the same effect as your written signature and can be used to authorize Transfers. You agree not to divulge your Password to any other person, and you agree not to use another person's User ID or Password. If, notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition, you give your Password to another person, you will be deemed to have authorized such person to use that Password for any and all purposes, without limitation. You agree to assume the entire responsibility at all times for the supervision, management, control and confidentiality of your Password. You agree that, to the extent permitted by law, you will assume the entire risk for fraudulent or unintentional use of your Password and that neither MoneyGram nor any Service Provider shall have any responsibility or liability to you or any other person for any losses or damages which you or anyone else may suffer if you disclose your Password to any other person, including any losses or damages arising out of the disclosure of your Password by the recipient to another person.</p>\n<p>18. Your Liability</p>\n<p>You agree to review and verify regularly and promptly all receipts and disclosures and respective debits for payment thereof from your Bank Account or Debit Card Account and charges against your Credit Card shown on our Website and, as applicable, on the statements you receive from the financial institution holding your Bank Account or Debit Card Account or issuing your Credit Card.</p>\n<p>Contact us AT ONCE at 1-800-689-8307, or email us through the \"Contact Us\" link on our Website at www.moneygram.com/wps/portal/moneygramonline if you believe your Password has been lost or stolen or if any debit to your Bank Account relating to a Transfer initiated through the Service(s) is erroneous or unauthorized or if any charge against your Credit Card is erroneous or unauthorized. Telephoning is the best way of minimizing your potential losses. Otherwise, you could lose all the money in your Bank Account or Debit Card Account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within two business days of becoming aware of the loss, theft or unauthorized or erroneous use of your Password, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your Password without your permission to make unauthorized or erroneous money transmissions for which payment was debited from your Bank Account or Debit Card Account.</p>\n<p>If you do NOT notify us within two business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your Password or the unauthorized or erroneous debiting of your Bank Account or Debit Card Account, and we can prove that with such notice we could have stopped someone from using your Password without your permission or initiating additional money transmissions through our Website if you had notified us, you could lose as much as $500.</p>\n<p>Also, if your bank statement shows transmissions by us that you did not authorize, tell us AT ONCE. If you do not tell us within 90 days after the FIRST bank statement on which the problem or error appeared was mailed to you, you may not recover any money you lost after such 90-day period if we can prove we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had notified us in time. If there are extenuating circumstances, such as a long trip or a hospital stay, that prevented you from notifying us, we will extend the notice period for a reasonable time.</p>\n<p>19. Error Resolution Notice</p>\n<p>In case of errors or questions about any debit to your Bank Account relating to a Transfer initiated through the Service(s) or any charge against your Credit Card, telephone us at 1-800-689-8307 or email us through the \"Contact Us\" link on our Website at www.moneygram.com/wps/portal/moneygramonline.</p>\n<p>Contact us as soon as you can, if you think a transaction on your statement or a receipt for a Transfer is wrong or, if you need more information about a transfer listed in your statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 90 days after the FIRST bank statement on which the problem or error appeared. When you notify us, you should:</p>\n<p>(a) provide your name, your User ID and Bank Account number;</p>\n<p>(b) describe the error or the Transfer you are unsure about and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information; and</p>\n<p>(c) disclose the dollar amount of the suspected error.</p>\n<p>If you notify us by telephone, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.</p>\n<p>We will tell you the results of our investigation within 10 business days after you notify us and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will provisionally re-credit your Bank Account or Debit Card Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error (including interest where applicable), so that you will have use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not provisionally re-credit your account.</p>\n<p>We will advise you of the results within three business days after we finish our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p>\n<p>20. Indemnification</p>\n<p>Except to the extent that MoneyGram is otherwise liable under this Agreement or by law, you agree to indemnify and hold MoneyGram, its shareholders, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, suppliers, Service Providers, and subcontractors harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, claims, demands, judgments and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorney's fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of or the performance of the Services. You provide this indemnification without regard to whether our claim for indemnification is due to the use of the Services by you or on your Bank Account or Debit Card Account.</p>\n<p>21. In Case of Errors or Questions About Transfers from Your Bank Account</p>\n<p>ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSFERS MADE WITH YOUR PASSWORD THAT ARE PAID FOR VIA A DEBIT TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT THROUGH THE WEBSITE MUST BE DIRECTED TO US (MONEYGRAM) AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HOLDING YOUR BANK ACCOUNT OR DEBIT CARD ACCOUNT.

Prior notice may not be given, however, when not required by law or where an immediate change is necessary for security purposes. By continuing to use the Service(s) after any such change, you agree to be bound by the changed terms and conditions of this Agreement as of the effective date of such changes.</p>\n<p>23. Termination</p>\n<p>MoneyGram may, without notice (except as required by law) and without liability to you, refuse to honor any instruction for a Transfer or terminate or suspend your access to the Services at any time and for any reason, including without limitation, if: (a) you attempt to transfer or charge funds from an account that does not belong to you or from an account which does not have sufficient available funds, or if you are paying by credit card, there is an insufficient available line of credit; (b) your financial institution attempts to charge back or reverse a Transfer entered into using a Service on the basis of a dispute related to a Transfer; (c) you use a Service, directly or indirectly, for any unlawful or improper purpose; (d) you provide incorrect or false information about yourself, your Bank Account, Debit Card Account, Credit Card Account or about a Receiver; (e) you attempt to tamper, hack, modify or otherwise corrupt the security or functionality of the Services or any Web site; (f) MoneyGram receives conflicting claims regarding ownership of, or the right to withdraw funds from, a Bank Account, Debit Card Account or Credit Card Account; (g) you have breached a term or condition of this Agreement, or any representation or warranty that you make under this Agreement is false; (h) MoneyGram determines that your Profile is inactive; or (i) MoneyGram believes that any Transfer you initiated may be fraudulent or impermissible, violate any applicable law, rule or regulation or otherwise expose you or MoneyGram to risk of loss.

(\"we\", \"us\" or \"MoneyGram\") through our Website, mobile site and through our network of agents, authorized delegates and other permitted entities (\"Agents\"). These Terms and Conditions, along with any forms, receipts, acknowledgements, or other documentation completed or used in connection with your use of the Services, including any pre-transaction or post-transaction disclosures, constitute the entire agreement (\"Agreement\") between you, the individual purchaser of the Services (\"you\" or \"Sender\") and MoneyGram.</p>\n<p>Additional information regarding the Services may be available and obtained online at <a href=\"http://www.moneygram.com/\">moneygram.com</a> or by asking an Agent. The Services, the underlying money transfer (\"Transfer\") and certain aspects of the Services and Transfer (including, but not limited to, Agent hours, Agent access, currencies held by an Agent, and the amount of a Transfer (\"Transfer Amount\"), may, as applicable, be delayed, restricted, forfeited, or ultimately unavailable due to certain laws and regulations governing our Services as well as certain circumstances and conditions associated with your use of the Services. We will report the Transfer and Transfer Amount, and other information relating to you and/or the use of the Services, to the appropriate legal or regulatory authorities, governing bodies or entities when necessary or appropriate pursuant to the laws and regulations governing our Services.</p>\n<h2>Electronic Consent and Communications</h2>\n<p>As a condition of your use of the Services, you consent to: having your bank account debited (or credited), your debit card account debited (or credited) and/or your credit card account charged against electronically to pay for any Transfers you initiate, as well as any applicable fees, including Transfer Fees, and other charges; electronically signing (by use of an electronic signature that evidences your identity) required documents and agreements; and receiving all required disclosures, notices, statements and other communications from us electronically (we may, at our sole discretion, post them at the Website or email or send them to you) (the \"Electronic Consent\").</p>\n<p>You must use your User ID and a private security code created by you that permits access to your Profile (your \"Password\"), to initiate a Transfer. You agree that your Password has the same effect as your written signature and can be used to authorize Transfers. You agree not to divulge your Password to any other person, and you agree not to use another person's User ID or Password. If, notwithstanding the foregoing prohibition, you give your Password to another person, you will be deemed to have authorized such person to use that Password for any and all purposes, without limitation. You agree to assume the entire responsibility at all times for the supervision, management, control and confidentiality of your Password. You agree that, to the extent permitted by law, you will assume the entire risk for fraudulent or unintentional use of your Password and that neither MoneyGram nor any Service Provider shall have any responsibility or liability to you or any other person for any losses or damages which you or anyone else may suffer if you disclose your Password to any other person, including any losses or damages arising out of the disclosure of your Password by the recipient to another person.</p>\n<p>Contact us AT ONCE at <a href=\"tel://1-800-922-7146\">1-800-922-7146</a> or email us through the \"<a href=\"http://moneygram.com/us/en/contact-form\">Contact MoneyGram</a>\" link if you believe your Password has been lost or stolen or if any debit to your bank account relating to a Transfer initiated through the Service(s) is erroneous or unauthorized or if any charge against your credit card is erroneous or unauthorized. Telephoning is the best way of minimizing your potential losses.</p>\n<p>Communications may be posted on the Website (or other Website(s) disclosed to you) and/or delivered to the email address you provide. You agree that these are reasonable procedures for sending and receiving electronic communications.</p>\n<h2>Signing Up to Use the Services. Eligible Users</h2>\n<p>In order to use either Service, you must be a United States resident; you must be at least 18 years of age; and you must apply to create an informational record that will be maintained by MoneyGram or its service providers based upon the information supplied by you (a \"Profile\"). You cannot send a Transfer on behalf of a third party. Other restrictions may apply. You can apply to create a Profile by entering the required information on the Website, establishing your User ID and Password, and agreeing to the terms of this Agreement. If MoneyGram accepts your application, it will open your Profile and activate the Service(s) you have requested. Both your User ID and Password are highly confidential and should not be shared with any other party.</p>\n<h2>Verification of Information</h2>\n<p>In an effort to combat money laundering activities and the funding of terrorism, the law requires a money transmitting institution such as MoneyGram to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who registers at its Website or initiates a Transfer through its Service(s). As part of the process required to establish a Profile on our Website or to initiate a transaction, we will ask for personally identifiable information about you, including but not limited to your name, address, date of birth, etc. that will help us to identify you. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, we may obtain information about you from your mobile carrier or data providers authorized by your mobile carrier or other third party sources, in order to verify your identity, administer your account, or protect you or us from fraudulent activity. You authorize your mobile carrier and their authorized data sources, to provide your account/subscriber information to us, including (if available) your name, address, email and device data for these purposes.</p>\n<p>If you refuse or fail to provide the requested information, we may decline to create a Profile for you or provide the Service(s) to you, or may discontinue providing such Service(s) to you at any time, in our sole discretion. You agree that if you initiate any Transfers through our Website, you are representing that all of the information provided by you in your Profile or on our Website is accurate.</p>\n<p>MoneyGram has the right to terminate your Profile and to refuse to process (or may reverse) any Transfer at any time, including but not limited to: (a) if it believes, in its sole discretion, you are using a Service for any illegal or improper purpose or (b) any Transfer exceeds the available funds on deposit in your bank account or debit card account or, if applicable, available line of credit under your credit card account; (c) we have reason to believe any Transfer may not be authorized by you; (d) any Transfer involves funds subject to a hold, dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal from the bank account or debit card account; (e) any Transfer would violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the Service, you or the financial institution where your bank account, debit card account or credit card account is held; (f) any Transfer is not in accordance with any other requirement stated in this Agreement or any of our policies, procedures or practices; or (g) for our protection or yours, we have reasonable cause not to process a Transfer request. You agree that neither MoneyGram nor any Agent or Service Provider will be held responsible or liable to you or any other person for such action except as required by law.</p>\n<p>For each Transfer you initiate for payment online you authorize MoneyGram (or any party authorized by MoneyGram) to debit from your bank account or debit card account, as applicable, or charge against your credit card account for the Transfer Amount you enter, plus any applicable fees, including the Transfer Fee, and charges. Whether the Transfer is made by debit of your bank account, debit card account or credit card account, the funds or credit, as applicable, must be available in the account from which the Transfer is made. MoneyGram shall have no obligation to effect a Transfer unless sufficient funds are available in your bank account, debit card account or credit card account, as applicable, and neither MoneyGram nor any Service Provider shall have any liability if a Transfer is not effected as a result of the unavailability of sufficient funds or credit. MoneyGram may resubmit for collection any Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") debit authorized by you that is returned to it for any reason. You are responsible if MoneyGram makes a Transfer you request and, for any reason, MoneyGram is unable to collect the funds from your bank account, debit card account or credit card account (as applicable), or the Transfer is later reversed.</p>\n<h2>Receive Information</h2>\n<p>The individual designated by you to receive the Transfer (\"Receiver\") may receive the funds sent by you at our Agents in Expected Destinations. As used herein, an \"Expected Destination\" generally means, for money transfer transactions from the United States that are to be received within the United States (\"Domestic Transfers\"), the State designated by you where the Receiver is to receive the Transfer within the United States or a State contiguous to such designated State; and for money transfer transactions sent from the United States that are to be received outside of the United States (\"International Transfers\"), the country or territory, as applicable, designated by you where the Receiver is to receive the Transfer. Depending on the type of Service selected by you, the disbursement of the Transfer will generally occur in the form of cash, money order, check, account deposit, or a combination of these payout methods (\"Payout Methods\"). Under certain circumstances, the Receiver may request a Payout Method that differs from the Payout Method you have selected and you authorize MoneyGram to honor the Receiver's election. A Transfer is deemed disbursed by us and delivered, and we have no further liability to you, except as set forth below, when it is actually disbursed by our Agent (or notice of the Transfer's disbursement is made available to us by the bank or account provider holding the account or their designee) to the Receiver, subject to the Receiver Identification provisions herein. Status tracking of a Transfer to an account may not be available from us. Certain Expected Destinations may impose taxes, fees, and or tariffs upon the Receiver's receipt of, or access to, the Transfer. All fees charged by us as part of the Transfer (\"Transfer Fees\" or \"Consumer Fees\"), all taxes collected by us and charged to you as part of the Transfer (\"Transfer Taxes\") and all applicable third party fees that are required to be disclosed to you (\"Other Fees\") shall each be as identified on the applicable pre-transaction and post-transaction disclosures generated with your Transfer. The financial institution that holds your bank account, debit card account or credit card account may impose fees in connection with your purchase of a Service. If you are paying for a Transfer by debit to your bank account or debit card account and there are insufficient funds in your bank account or debit card account, you will be subject to an additional fee. Transactions which (i) exceed certain amounts; (ii) are to certain Expected Destinations; (iii) implicate any legal, compliance or other regulatory issues; or (iv) are sent through delayed delivery options may take longer than anticipated for delivery, may be subject to dollar limits or may be subject to additional restrictions and may affect the ability for the Transfer to be disbursed. At no time will either you or the Receiver have a deposit with MoneyGram.</p>\n<h2>Receiving an ExpressPayment&reg; Transaction</h2>\n<p>MoneyGram will usually make information concerning your payment available to a company that has authorized MoneyGram to accept payments on its behalf from consumers (a \"Biller\") within ten (10) minutes after MoneyGram's receipt of your payment on a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or banking holiday, that banks in the United States are open for business to the public (a \"Business Day\"). If your Transfer occurs after 11:00 PM CST notice will not be made available to your Biller until the next business day. MoneyGram has no control over the time the Biller credits the payment to your account. Posting time will vary from Biller to Biller. Check with your Biller for payment posting times. If it is important that your Biller receive same day notice of your payment please go to a MoneyGram Location. Notice of ExpressPayment transfer payments made at a MoneyGram location can usually be made available to your Biller within ten (10) minutes after your payment is made.</p>\n<h2>Refund Information</h2>\n<p>Subject to applicable law, (i) your Transfer may be cancelled for a refund of the Transfer Amount, unless the Transfer has been disbursed or deposited by us at the time we received your cancellation request and (ii) except as described below, the Transfer Fees associated with your Transfer are usually not refundable. To cancel a Transfer or request a refund, contact the MoneyGram Online Electronic Operations Center through the Website or via phone at <a href=\"tel://1-800-922-7146\">1-800-922-7146</a>. All refund requests for Domestic Transfers will be subject to MoneyGram's review and discretion and will normally be processed within thirty (30) days of receipt of a valid written request unless a shorter period is required by law. Effective October 28, 2013 (i) International Transfers may be cancelled for a full refund of the Transfer Amount and all Transfer Fees or Transfer Taxes paid by you within thirty (30) minutes after you have made the payment for the Transfer, unless such International Transfer has already been disbursed by us at the time of such oral or written cancellation request and (ii)you may be entitled to a full refund of the Transfer Amount and all Transfer Fees or Transfer Taxes paid by you if an error has occurred as set forth above or as otherwise provided under applicable law. Your rights regarding the Transfer are further explained under the applicable disclosures generated in connection with such International Transfer.</p>\n<p>If MoneyGram determines that you are entitled to a refund, it will be credited to your original funding source, (which may be your bank account, debit card account or credit card account, as applicable).</p>\n<h2>Identification, Test Questions and Reference Numbers</h2>\n<p>We reserve the right to require, and may be legally required to obtain, documentation that will identify you and/or any Receiver in connection with any purchase and/or use of our Services (\"ID\"). In some Agent locations, the Receiver may also be required to provide a test question answer, instead of ID, to receive the Transfer. Test questions may not be available in certain Agent locations or Expected Destinations. While you will receive a reference number that corresponds to your Transfer (\"Reference Number\"), such Reference Number is not always required to receive a Transfer where other identification means (such as ID receipt or test questions) are utilized. MoneyGram shall not have any liability in the event that the Transfer is disbursed, when and as applicable, to an individual who properly answers a test question, provides ID to the Agent describing such person as the Receiver (even if such ID was false or forged), or provides the Reference Number.</p>\n<h2>Receipts and Records of Transfers</h2>\n<p>After your Transfer is sent, please save the receipt to your local hard drive for your records and/or print out a copy of the receipt. Records of all Transfers involving your Profile will be posted and updated on the Website on a continuing basis. You may access these records at any time by logging in and clicking on the My Account link found at <a href=\"http://www.moneygram.com/\">moneygram.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Exchange Rate; Currency Availability</h2>\n<p>In addition to the Transfer Fees applicable to your Transfer, if the Transfer is an International Transfer, a currency exchange rate may be applied. United States currency is converted to a foreign currency at an exchange rate set by us (\"Exchange Rate\"). The Exchange Rate described on any pre-transaction and post-transaction disclosures provided by MoneyGram to you has been rounded to the number of decimal places identified on such disclosures. The number of decimal places used by MoneyGram to convert the currency into foreign currency may be greater than that displayed on the disclosures. Any difference in the Exchange Rate disclosed to you in writing and the exchange rate received by MoneyGram will be kept by MoneyGram (and/or its Agents in some cases). Payouts will generally be made in the national currency of the Expected Destination (\"Local Currency\"). In some countries or territories you may designate a payout currency other than the Local Currency. The payout currency, whether expressed in the Local Currency or otherwise, shall be reflected in the pre-transaction and post-transaction disclosures. Because not all currencies are available in all Agent locations, please ask an Agent or contact us by visiting <a href=\"http://www.moneygram.com/\">moneygram.com</a> or calling <a href=\"tel://1-800-922-7146\">1-800-922-7146</a> for information regarding the currency Exchange Rate or the currencies available in the Expected Destination.</p>\n<h2>Your Other Financial Obligations</h2>\n<p>To the extent allowed by law, MoneyGram also has the right to collect from you the amount of any uncollected or reversed Transfer, plus any fees assessed and collection expenses, court costs and attorneys' fees. To the extent allowed by law, you agree to hold MoneyGram harmless from any losses, costs, expenses or damages it may incur in connection with collecting for any Transfer or in defending any of the foregoing actions, including court costs and attorneys' fees. You may be reported to a collection agency or credit bureau if you do not pay for any Transfer or Transfer Fee you have authorized in accordance with this agreement. You authorize MoneyGram to debit your bank account or debit card account and/or charge against your credit card account for any amounts owing to MoneyGram described in this section.</p>\n<p><strong>LIABILITY. UNLESS APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES OTHERWISE, YOUR EXCLUSIVE AND MAXIMUM REMEDY AGAINST MONEYGRAM IS REFUND OF THE TRANSFER AMOUNT PLUS ANY TRANSFER FEES CHARGED BY MONEYGRAM. NO OTHER REMEDY IS AVAILABLE TO YOU, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY REMEDY FOR INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY WHETHER YOUR CLAIM ARISES DUE TO MONEYGRAM OR ITS AGENTS' NEGLIGENCE, OTHER FAULT, ERROR, OMISSION OR NON-PERFORMANCE. WE ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF A RECEIVER'S BANK, SERVICE PROVIDER OR THEIR DESIGNEES.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ARBITRATION. UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TRANSFER, THE AGREEMENT OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING STATUTORY CONSUMER CLAIMS, SHALL BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (\"AAA\") UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES. JUDGMENT ON THE</strong></p>\n<p><strong>ARBITRATION AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF. ANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE INITIATED AND HELD IN THE OFFICE OF THE AAA CLOSEST TO THE AGENT LOCATION WHERE YOU INITIATED THE TRANSFER. EACH PARTY SHALL BEAR ITS OWN COSTS AND FEES FOR EXPERTS AND ATTORNEYS, AND NO PARTY SHALL HAVE A RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS. THIS EXCLUSIVE ARBITRATION REMEDY SHALL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNLESS INITIATED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM AROSE.</strong></p>\n<h2>General</h2>\n<p>This Agreement is governed by Minnesota law without regard to its conflicts of law rules, supersedes all prior agreements or understandings between you and MoneyGram, and cannot be modified orally. In the event of any conflict between the English version of our Agreement with you and any non-English version, the English version shall control and govern. Services are directed to persons 18 years and over, may not be used for escrow purposes or gambling, and may only be used for a lawful purpose. You represent, warrant and acknowledge to MoneyGram that (i) all information you supply to us as part of this Agreement is truthful, accurate and complete, (ii) you have received and reviewed a pre-transaction disclosure and/or receipt in connection with your purchase of Services and that the information contained on such documentation is complete and accurate and (iii) your use of the Services does not violate any law, including without limitation, laws relating to money laundering, illegal gambling activities, support for terrorist activities or fraud. You shall indemnify MoneyGram and its Agents for all losses of any kind (including attorney's fees) arising out of any breach of the Agreement by you or by the Receiver. MoneyGram may refuse to provide Services to any person.</p>\n<h2>Change in Terms</h2>\n<p>We may change the terms and conditions of this Agreement from time to time, at our sole discretion, and (a) if required by law, sending a notice of such change or a copy of the amended agreement to your last address or email address shown in our records or (b) if required by law, posting a notice at the Website. Prior notice may not be given, however, when not required by law or where an immediate change is necessary for security purposes. By continuing to use the Service(s) after any such change, you agree to be bound by the changed terms and conditions of this Agreement as of the effective date of such changes.</p>\n<h2>Privacy Notice</h2>\n<p>MoneyGram may disclose your personal information to third parties as outlined in the MoneyGram Privacy Statement, which is available on our website at <a href=\"http://www.moneygram.com/\">www.moneygram.com</a> or by calling <a href=\"tel://1-800-926-9400\">1-800-926-9400</a>.

It's our goal to educate consumers on ways to safeguard their money and personal information and avoid becoming a victim of consumer fraud.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of known consumer scams. However, others may exist, so it's always safest to use common sense when sending money. The most important tip we can give is do not send money to someone you do not know.</p>\n<h2>Disaster Relief</h2>\n<p>In times of disaster, it's important to be aware of charity scams. There are many legitimate ways to provide support to help people impacted by floods, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters. If you're eager to make a donation, give in a way that you have donated before or through a trusted organization or business where you fully understand how the funds are being collected and used.</p>\n<p>It is important to never send funds using a wire transfer service like MoneyGram to someone you do not know. Occasionally, MoneyGram will support donation programs with a well established charity. Currently, MoneyGram is accepting cash donations for the American Red Cross using ExpressPayment code 3825. This is a secure means of donating to the American Red Cross. There is no charge for the service.</p>\n<h2>Foreign Lottery</h2>\n<p>The U.S. government recently issued a national warning about the continued defrauding of citizens taking place through a foreign lottery or sweepstakes scam. Be aware that if you receive a notice about winning a lottery, no matter how official it looks, and are required to pay a fee to claim your winnings - this is a scam.</p>\n<h3>What to be aware of:</h3>\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>A federal statute prohibits mailing lottery tickets, advertisements, or payments to purchase tickets in a foreign lottery.</li>\n<li>Be leery if you do not remember entering a lottery or sweepstakes.</li>\n<li>Beware of lotteries or sweepstakes that charge a fee prior to delivering your prize.</li>\n<li>Be wary of demands to send additional money as a requirement to be eligible for future winnings.</li>\n<li>For more details visit the FBI's fraud database, Internet Crime Complaint Center</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Buying a Vehicle</h2>\n<p>Have you found a great vehicle online or in an advertisement with a price too good to be true? Are you being asked to send the down payment through a MoneyGram money transfer?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it's a SCAM. Do not send money for the vehicle to the seller or a payments representative. The vehicle purchase scammer may try to convince you to pay through MoneyGram to avoid sales tax and get a great price. They may even send you a letter or e-mail of authentication telling you that you have purchased the item, but in order to deliver it you need to wire funds first. Do not send the money. It is a SCAM. You will not receive a car or truck. Once money is wired and received, it cannot be recovered and, unfortunately, you will be at loss for any money transferred.</p>\n<h2>Sending Money to a Stranger</h2>\n<p>MoneyGram never recommends sending money to a stranger. Any monies received by a stranger cannot be recovered and unfortunately you will not get your money refunded back to you.</p>\n<p>MoneyGram is very safe and secure when sending to someone you know and trust.</p>\n<h2>Lottery/Sweepstakes</h2>\n<p>Legitimate lottery or sweepstakes NEVER require people pay money up front. Get a letter, call, or e-mail saying you won something (money or a prize), but before you can collect the prize you need to send money to pay for taxes, customs, or any fees? But you didn't buy a ticket or enter a sweepstakes. This is a SCAM. Don't send transfer money to the people who are stating you have \"WON\" something but need to send them funds to collect your winnings.</p>\n<h2>Internet Purchases</h2>\n<p>Have you found something online that interests you - a puppy, a car, an apartment for rent or any item for sale? Does the price for the item seem to be too good to be true and are you being asked to pay for the item through a MoneyGram money transfer? Unfortunately, this is a SCAM. Do not send money for the item to the seller. They may even send you a letter or e-mail of authentication telling you that you have purchased the item but need to wire funds first. Do not send the money. It is a SCAM. You will receive no merchandise. Once money is wired and received it cannot be recovered and unfortunately you will be at loss for any money transferred.</p>\n<h2>Relative in Need</h2>\n<p>Did you receive a phone call from a grandchild or a family member? Or a \"lawyer\" or \"police officer\" there with your family member? Are they in despair because they have been detained in Canada for not having a fishing license or for catching a protected species of fish? Have they been in a car accident? Are they asking for money to pay fines or for car repair? Did a relative call because they need money for a family member in medical need or for medicine? THIS IS A SCAM! Use precaution when sending money in any of these situations. These callers can request that you send money anywhere in the world. If you cannot verify with your family member (calling their number you had before this call, not the \"new number\" the caller gives you) that they are requesting money and aren't sure about the transaction, do not send the money. You will be at a loss for any money that is sent.</p>\n<h2>Loans</h2>\n<p>Did you receive an e-mail or letter about getting a loan? Were you asked to send money for loan fees, taxes, service fees, advance payments, or any other reason? This is a SCAM. Do not send money to a loan company to obtain a loan. If the money is wired and received it can not be recovered. You will be at a loss for the money you have sent.</p>\n<h2>Check/Money Order</h2>\n<p>Get a check or money order in the mail with instructions to first cash it at your bank and then send some of the funds to someone else through a MoneyGram money transfer? If so, the check/money order is counterfeit and your bank will make you cover the loss. Be aware that counterfeit checks are very hard to identify. You may have been promised a percentage of the check for employment or because of an over payment. This is a SCAM. Do not send the money and do not cash the check.</p>\n<h2>Romance</h2>\n<p>Did you meet someone through a personal ad, e-mail, chat room or an instant message? Did they ask you to send them money for travel or to help them financially? Do not wire the money - this is a SCAM. Any money received by this person cannot be recovered and you will be at loss for any money sent.</p>\n<h2>Newspaper Ads</h2>\n<p>Have you found something for sale in the classifieds or any type of newspaper ad? Did they ask you to pay for the item through a MoneyGram money transfer? This is a SCAM. Do not use a money transfer to purchase an item from a stranger. It is not safe to use a money transfer service when trying to purchase an item.</p>\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n<p>In our efforts to educate consumers about fraud, MoneyGram developed an educational website that contains information on common scams, tips on how to protect yourself from being scammed and fraud statistics.<a href=\"http://corporate.moneygram.com/compliance/fraud-prevention\">Visit the site.</a></p>\n<p>If you are ever a victim of fraud we suggest you report it to your local law enforcement. Below is a list of other resources that may be helpful in your reporting of an incident or researching a potential fraudulent situation.</p>\n<h2>Internet Complaint Center</h2>\n<p>If you were a victim of fraud via the Internet, you should file a report with your local law enforcement along with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (ICCC). The ICCC is a partnership between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center. You can make a report with the ICCC by going to the following link: <a href=\"http://www.ic3.gov/\">http://www.ic3.gov/</a></p>\n<h2>Where to Research</h2>\n<p>Did you come across something that you are not to sure of? If so, review our list potential of scams or you may also want to visit <a href=\"http://www.lookstoogoodtobetrue.com\">www.lookstoogoodtobetrue.com</a> for any questions you might have.</p>\n<h2>Money Sent to Canada</h2>\n<p>If you were a victim of fraud and the funds were sent to Canada, you should make a report with your local law enforcement and contact Phonebusters. Phonebusters is a joint U.S. and Canadian police task force working together to reduce cross border fraud. You can reach Phonebusters at <a href=\"tel://1-888-495-8501\">1-888-495-8501</a>.
