      <p><font color="#000080">The Olympic Games begun at Olympia in Greece in
      776 BC. The Greek calendar was based on the Olympiad, the four-year period
      between games. The games were staged in the wooded valley of Olympia in
      Elis. Here the Greeks erected statues and built temples in a grove
      dedicated to Zeus, supreme among the gods. The greatest shrine was an
      ivory and gold statue of Zeus. Created by the sculptor Phidias, it was
      considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Scholars have speculated
      that the games in 776 BC were not the first games, but rather the first
      games held after they were organized into festivals held every four years
      as a result of a peace agreement between the city-states of Elis and Pisa.
      The Eleans traced the founding of the Olympic games to their King Iphitos,
      who was told by the Delphi Oracle to plant the olive tree from which the
      victors' wreaths were made.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">According to Hippias of Elis, who compiled a list
      of Olympic victors c.400 BC, at first the only Olympic event was a
      200-yard dash, called a stadium. This was the only event until 724 BC,
      when a two-stadia race was added. Two years later the 24-stadia event
      began, and in 708 the pentathlon was added and wrestling became part of
      the games. This pentathlon, a five-event match consisted of running,
      wrestling, leaping, throwing the discus, and hurling the javelin. In time
      boxing, a chariot race, and other events were included.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The victors of these early games were crowned
      with wreaths from a sacred olive tree that grew behind the temple of Zeus.
      According to tradition this tree was planted by Hercules (Heracles),
      founder of the games. The winners marched around the grove to the
      accompaniment of a flute while admirers chanted songs written by a
      prominent poet.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The Olympic Games were held without interruptions
      in ancient Greece. The games were even held in 480 BC during the Persian
      Wars, and coincided with the Battle of Thermopylae. Although the Olympic
      games were never suspended, the games of 364 BC were not considered
      Olympic since the Arkadians had captured the sanctuary and reorganized the
      games.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">After the Battle of Chaironeia in 338 BC, Philip
      of Makedon and his son Alexander gained control over the Greek
      city-states. They erected the Philippeion (a family memorial) in the
      sanctuary, and held political meetings at Olympia during each Olympiad. In
      146 BC, the Romans gained control of Greece and, therefore, of the Olympic
      games. In 85 BC, the Roman general Sulla plundered the sanctuary to
      finance his campaign against Mithridates. Sulla also moved the 175th
      Olympiad (80 BC) to Rome.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The games were held every four years from 776 BC
      to 393 AD, when they were abolished by the Christian Byzantine Emperor
      Theodosius I. The ancient Olympic Games lasted for 1170 years.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The successful campaign to revive the Olympics
      was started in France by Baron Pierre de Coubertin late in the 19th
      century. The first of the modern Summer Games opened on Sunday, March 24,
      1896, in Athens, Greece. The first race was won by an American college
      student named James Connolly.</font></p>

      </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p><font color="#000080">There are several Greek myths about how the games
      were started. The most common myth was the story of the hero Pelops, after
      whom the Peloponnese is named (&quot;Pelops’ isle&quot;). The story of
      Pelops was displayed prominently on the east pedimental sculptures of the
      Temple of Zeus. Pelops was a prince from Lydia in Asia Minor who sought
      the hand of Hippodamia, the daughter of King Oinomaos of Pisa. Oinomaos
      challenged his daughter's suitors to a chariot race under the guarantee
      that any young man who won the chariot race could have Hippodamia as a
      wife. Any young man who lost the race would be beheaded, and the heads
      would be used as decoration for the palace of Oinomaos. With the help of
      his charioteer Myrtilos, Pelops devised a plan to beat Oinomaos in the
      chariot race. Pelops and Myrtilos secretly replaced the bronze linchpins
      of the King's chariot with linchpins made of wax. When Oinomaos was about
      to pass Pelops in the chariot race, the wax melted and Oinomaos was thrown
      to his death. Pelops married Hippodamia and instituted the Olympic games
      to celebrate his victory. A different version of the myth refers to the
      Olympic games as funeral games in the memory of Oinomaos.</font></p>

      </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p><font color="#000080">Another myth about the origin of the Olympic
      Games comes from the Tenth Olympian Ode of the poet Pindar. He tells the
      story of how Herakles, on his fifth labor, had to clean the stables of
      King Augeas of Elis. Herakles approached Augeas and promised to clean the
      stables for the price of one-tenth of the king's cattle. Augeas agreed,
      and Herakles rerouted the Kladeos and Alpheos rivers to flow through the
      stables. Augeas did not fulfill his promise, however, and after Herakles
      had finished his labors he returned to Elis and waged war on Augeas.
      Herakles sacked the city of Elis and instituted the Olympic Games in honor
      of his father, Zeus. It is said that Herakles taught men how to wrestle
      and measured out the stadium, or the length of the footrace.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080">The ancient Greeks were highly competitive and
      believed strongly in the concept of &quot;agon&quot;, or
      &quot;competition&quot; or &quot;contest&quot;. The ultimate Greek goal
      was to be the best. All aspects of life, especially athletics, were
      centered around this concept. It was therefore considered one of the
      greatest honors to win a victory at Olympia. The fact that the only prize
      given at Olympia was an olive wreath illustrates this point. The athletes
      competed for honor, not for material goods.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Athletics were of prime importance to the Greeks.
      The education of boys concentrated on athletics and music as well as
      academic subjects such as philosophy. Education took place in the
      gymnasion and the palaistra as well as the academy.</font></p>

      </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p><font color="#000080">In ancient Greece, games were closely connected
      to the worship of the gods and heroes. Games were held as part of
      religious ceremonies in honor of deceased heroes, a concept displayed in
      the funeral games for Patroklos in Book 23 of Homer's epic poem, <em>The
      Iliad</em>. Games were also held in the context of many ancient fertility
      festivals. The games at Olympia were connected with both the funeral games
      of Oinomaos, established by Pelops, and a fertility cult involving any
      number of gods and goddesses who were worshipped at the site. The Olympic
      games began to be usurped by the prominent cult of Zeus, and eventually

      <p><font color="#000080">The Greek calendar was based on the conception of
      the four-year Olympiad. When Greek historians referred to dates, they most
      often referred to a year (i.e., first, second, third, fourth) within the
      Olympiad that the event occurred. The winner of the stadium race in a
      given year had the Olympiad named in honor of him. The first Olympiad is
      therefore known as that of Koroibos of Elis, the winner of the stadium
      race in 776 BC.</font></p>

      </font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
      <p><font color="#000080">The sacred truce was instituted during the month
      of the Olympiad. Messengers known as &quot;spondorophoroi&quot; carried
      the word of the truce and announced the date of the games all over the
      Greek world. The truce called for a cessation of all hostilities for a
      period of one month (later three months) to allow for the safe travel of
      athletes to and from Olympia. Armies and armed individuals were barred
      from entering the sanctuary. In addition, no death penalties could be
      carried out during the period of the truce.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080">From the beginning, the games at Olympia served
      as a bond between Greeks and strengthened the Greek sense of national
      unity. During the Hellenistic period, Greeks who came to live in foreign
      surroundings such as Syria, Asia, and Egypt, strove to hold on to their
      culture. One of the ways to achieve this was to build athletic facilities
      and continue their athletic traditions. They organized competitions, and
      sent competitors from their towns to compete in the Panhellenic games.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">In the 2nd century A.D., Roman citizenship was
      extended to everyone within the Roman empire. From then on, the
      participation of many competitors from outside of Greece in the Olympic
      games, gave them to a degree, international nature.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">When the Greek government reinstated the games in
      1896, this international character of the competitions was preserved by
      Baron de Coubertin. Now, 16 centuries later, the Olympic games attract
      competitors from countries all over the world.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080">The best amateur athletes in the world match
      skill and endurance in a series of contests called the Olympic Games.
      Almost every nation sends teams of selected athletes to take part. The
      purposes of the Olympic Games are to foster the ideal of a &quot;sound
      mind in a sound body&quot; and to promote friendship among nations.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The modern Olympic Games are named for athletic
      contests held in ancient Greece for almost 12 centuries. They were banned
      in AD 394 but were revived and made international in 1896. The Winter
      Games were added in 1924. World War I and World War II forced cancellation
      of the Olympics in 1916, 1940, and 1944, but they resumed in 1948 and are
      held every four years. After 1992 the Winter and Summer Games were no
      longer held within the same calendar year. Winter Games were scheduled for
      1994, after only a two-year interval, and every four years thereafter. The
      Summer Games were scheduled for 1996, and every four years thereafter.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080">Summer sports include archery, basketball,
      boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian events (horseback riding), fencing,
      field hockey, gymnastics, handball, judo, rowing, shooting, soccer,
      swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball, water polo, weight lifting,
      wrestling, and yachting. Winter events include skating, skiing,
      bobsledding, luge, tobogganing, ice hockey, and the biathlon
      (skiing-shooting).</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The most exacting track and field event is the
      decathlon (from the Greek words <i>deka, </i>meaning &quot;ten,&quot; and <i>athlon,
      </i>&quot;contest&quot;). Contestants compete in ten different running,
      jumping, and throwing events. The athlete scoring the greatest total
      number of points is the winner. The pentathlon, consisting of five such
      events, was discontinued after 1924. It was restored in the 1948 games as
      the modern pentathlon, based upon five military skills--fencing, riding,
      running, shooting, and swimming. The marathon race, covering 26 miles 385
      yards, honors the ancient Greek runner Pheidippides, who ran from Marathon
      to Athens to announce the Greek victory against the Persians.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Women take part in separate summer and winter
      events. Ten new women's summer competitions added in 1984 included the
      marathon and a 49-mile cycling event. The pentathlon, introduced in 1964,
      was replaced by the heptathlon, which consists of 100-meter hurdles, shot
      put, high jump, long jump, javelin throw, and 200- and 800-meter races.
      Additional events for women in the 1992 Winter and Summer Games included
      the biathlon, 10-kilometer walk, baseball, and judo.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080">One of the most dramatic feats of the Olympics
      was the triumph of the United States track and field team in 1896.
      Competing as unofficial representatives, the ten-man squad reached Athens
      barely in time to participate. They won nine out of 12 events.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">In 1912 Jim Thorpe, a Native American, became the
      only man to win both the decathlon and pentathlon in one year. Officials
      canceled his record and took back his medals when they learned that he had
      played professional baseball. His medals were restored posthumously in
      1982. In track and field, Jesse Owens, a black
      American, won four gold medals including a team medal in 1936. The first woman to win three individual gold medals was Fanny
      Blankers-Koen of The Netherlands. The first athletes to win the decathlon
      twice were Bob Mathias of the United States, in 1948 and 1952, and Daley
      Thompson of Great Britain, in 1980 and 1984. The first perfect 10.0 in
      Olympic gymnastics was scored by Nadia Comaneci of Romania, who received
      seven perfect scores and three gold medals in 1976.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">In the 1964 Winter Games the Soviet speed skater
      Lidya Skoblikova was the first athlete to win four individual gold medals.
      Her feat was duplicated in the 1968 Summer Games by the Czech gymnast Vera
      Caslavska.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">In 1972 the United States swimmer Mark Spitz won
      a record seven gold medals at a single Olympics. Swimmers John Naber of
      the United States and Kornelia Ender of East Germany each won four gold
      medals in the Summer Games in 1976.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The all-time individual medal winner was the
      American track athlete Ray C. Ewry, who won eight events in the 1900,
      1904, and 1908 Games.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The 1972 Summer Games in Munich, West Germany,
      became a tragedy when Palestinian terrorists murdered 11 Olympic team
      members from Israel. In a protest against a New Zealand rugby tour of
      South Africa about 30 African nations boycotted the 1976 Summer Games in
      Montreal, Que. To protest the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan more
      than 60 countries, led by the United States, withdrew from the 1980 Summer
      Games in Moscow. The Soviet Union, which first participated in 1952,
      withdrew from the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Scandals rocked the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul.
      Ten athletes were disqualified after drug tests revealed steroid abuse.
      Charges of bias and incompetence in the officiating at the boxing events
      led to two-year suspensions for five Korean boxers and officials and
      several other judges and referees.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The 1992 games were unusual in that there were no
      more Soviet teams; the Soviet Union had split up in December 1991. The
      teams that participated from its former republics, sometimes still wearing
      the old Soviet uniforms, represented either now-independent Baltic states
      or the Commonwealth of Independent States, which had been formed from 11
      of the former Soviet republics. Nevertheless, at the Winter Games in
      Albertville the Commonwealth's United Team came in second, after Germany,
      in number of medals won.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">In the 1896 Olympic Games there were fewer than
      500 athletes representing 13 nations. In 1988 the Seoul games drew entries
      from a record total of 160 countries. While the number of athletes who
      competed in Los Angeles did not surpass the high of 10,000 set at Munich
      in 1972, the 1984 games set records for the largest total
      attendance--almost 5.8 million people--and the most gold medals for one
      country--83 for the United States.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">The centennial Olympic Games opened in Atlanta,
      Ga., with more than 10,000 athletes from a record 197 nations in
      attendance. The opening ceremonies, which began 16 days of athletic
      competition, featured a tribute to the ancient Greek games and slain civil
      rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Former world heavyweight boxing
      champion and Olympic gold medalist Muhammad Ali lit the Olympic torch,
      which completed a 84-day, 15,000-mile (24,000-kilometer) trek across the
      United States. The games featured 28 delegations that were participating
      for the first time, including athletes from the Czech Republic, FYROM, and
      Burundi, and Palestinians competing under the name Palestine. Tight
      security and Atlanta's hot and humid August weather were major concerns
      for Olympic organizers and those attending the games. In spite of security
      precautions, a homemade pipe bomb loaded with nails and screws exploded at
      a late-night concert in Centennial Olympic Park, killing one person and
      wounding more than 100 others. In addition, a Turkish television cameraman
      died of a heart attack while running to film the blast. No one claimed
      responsibility for the attack.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#000080">The development and governance of the modern
      games are vested in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), founded in
      Paris in 1894. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. The original
      committee had 14 members; today there are about 70. These individuals are
      considered ambassadors from the committee to their national sports
      organizations and are dedicated to promoting amateur athletics. Normally
      there is only one member from each country. Presidents of the IOC are
      elected for an eight-year term and eligible for succeeding four-year
      terms.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">Each country sending teams to the games must have
      its own National Olympic Committee. By 1988 there were 167 such
      committees. One responsibility of a national committee is arranging for
      its team's participation in the games, providing equipment, and getting
      the team to the game site and into specially arranged housing.</font></p>
