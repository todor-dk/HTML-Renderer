			<a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/index_uk.asp">Olympic Games</a> 
			in the Greek Antiquity can be traced back to the 776 BC. The games 
			were dedicated to the 12 Olympian Gods and were hosted on the

			magnificent great temples of the two gods
			<a href="http://www.in2greece.com/english/historymyth/mythology/names/zeus.htm">
			Zeus</a> and his wife Hera. The games initially had a very religious 
			character combined by a number of ancient sport events, which many 
			of those were based on the ancient Greek mythology.<br />
			<br />
			The ancient Olympic Games had an important position in the life of 
			the Ancient Greeks. The Olympiad it was a time of union, with a 
			four-year interval. The participants came from every corner of the 
			Greek world to compete for the ultimate prize, the olive wreath and 
			the return to their city-states as heroes. But the Olympic values 
			apart from the victory, it was themselves which had the special 
			meaning in the Games, the noble competition and effort to combine 
			the body, mind, and will in a balanced whole.<br />
			<br />
			As the Olympics developed, so did developed the procedures such 
			as the standard schedule of the events and the
			<a href="http://www.olympictruce.org/">Olympic Truce</a>. They Games 
			continued for almost 12 centuries, until the Roman Emperor
			Theodosius 
			banned them, in 393 AD, accusing them as pagan cults.</p>

			<p>The Olympics is a sporting event for many different sports 
			that is every four years. The original Olympic Games were held in 
			the ancient Greek city of Olympia that since the 10th century BC. 
			was a religious and political meeting place. <br />
			The first recorded celebration of the Games at Olympia was in 776 
			BC. It is almost certain that this was not the first time that the 
			Games were held. Then the Games were only local and had only one 
			race, the race of the stadium. <br />
			<br />
			Although the Olympic games were originally held on the fields around the 
			temple of Zeus, with the growth of the Games increased also the 
			buildings of the Stadium. Finally Ancient Olympia had a stadium that offered 
			enough space to 40,000 spectators. The Olympic Games which were held 
			every four years, were one of the four Pan-Hellenic Games. The 
			purpose of Olympic Games was for young men to show their physical 
			qualities and to enforce the relationship between the various Greek 
			cities. Only Greek men were allowed to participate in the Olympics 
			but not women. <br />
			<br />
			From 776 BC the Olympic Games, became more important in the ancient 
			Greece reaching the height of their fame in the 5th and 6th century 
			BC. The Olympics also had religious significance since there were 
			dedicated to Zeus, whose huge statue was standing in Olympia. The 
			number of sports was twenty and the celebrations were held for 
			several days. The winners of the games were admired and immortalised 
			through poems and statues. The prize for the winner was a crown of 
			olive branches. <br />
			<br />
			The Games gradually lost their importance when the Romans conquered 
			Greece and when Christianity became the official religion of the 
			Roman Empire. The Games were regarded more as a pagan celebration, 
			and in 393 AD, the Emperor Theodosius banned them completely. So 
			ended a period of one thousand years during which the Olympics were 
			to be conducted every four years thereafter.<br />
			<br />
			The Olympic games revived by the French 
			<a href="http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580518/pierre_de_coubertin.html">Baron Pierre de Coubertin</a> in 
			the late 19 th century. The Games of the Olympiad, also known as 
			Summer Olympics, taking place every four years since 1896 onwards, 
			with the exception of the years during the World Wars. In 1924 began 
			the Winter Olympics, for winter sports. Since 1994, the Winter Games 
			are not held the same year with the 
			<a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/index_uk.asp">Summer Olympics</a>.In 
			July 2012 the Olympics will be held in London UK.</p>
