<h1>Breaking News has shut down operations as of December 31, 2016.</h1>

<p>Thank you so much for using this service &mdash; knowing that we had passionate, engaged people relying on Breaking News made our hard work especially meaningful. Many of the features we implemented came directly from your feedback. Thank you.</p>

<p>In our six-year run we had the honor of being at the forefront of news, technology and public safety, always focused on verifiable news delivered as fast as humanly possible. There still isn't that perfect news product, but we hope the future will be full of attempts to make one. We'd love to see more startups, more experimentation, more investment, more long-shots into funding models, more doubling-down into technologies that will benefit journalists, users and the world. </p>

<p>We've lit up your screen, buzzed your pocket and reached out across the room with our three-note alert sound. We've told you about things you cared about, and helped you feel more in touch with the world. We helped you find out first, giving you an edge and even helping keep you safe. We loved doing it. We're going to miss it. Thank you for being on the other end of that glowing screen.</p>

      <div class="description padded"><p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics</b> (Portuguese: <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016</i></span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad</b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016</b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.</p>
<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part. With 306 sets of medals, the games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city, and at five in São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.</p>
<p>These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. The host city Rio de Janeiro was announced at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009. Rio became the first South American city to host the Summer Olympics. These were the first games to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first to be held entirely in the host country's winter, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The lead-up to these Games was marked by controversies, including the instability of the country's federal government; health and safety concerns surrounding the Zika virus and significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and a doping scandal involving Russia, which has affected the participation of its athletes in the Games.</p>
<p>The United States topped the medal table for the fifth time in the past six Summer Olympics, winning the most golds (46) and most medals overall (121), as well as its 1,000th Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country in the history of the modern Olympics to increase its tally of medals in the subsequent games after being the host nation. China finished third. Host country Brazil won seven gold medals, its most at any single Summer Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Fiji, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan, Ivory Coast and Vietnam each won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).</p></div>

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","links":"","id":30,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","latitude":54.314072,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/andy-murray\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andy_Murray\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:44:56.290363","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"andy-murray","created_on":"2010-09-05T23:08:33","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/eU","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1880","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andy_Murray","name":"Andy Murray","image_height":595,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":145,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/bf\/2015_Australian_Open_-_Andy_Murray_12_%28cropped%29.jpg\/512px-2015_Australian_Open_-_Andy_Murray_12_%28cropped%29.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1880\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Andrew Barron<\/b> \"<b>Andy<\/b>\" <b>Murray<\/b>, OBE (born 15 May 1987) is a Scottish professional tennis player currently ranked world No. 1 in men's singles.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2imwT8Y","longitude":null,"slug":"olympic-gold-medal-winners-andy-murray-and-mo","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsBreak\/status\/814962019598213120","date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdOF","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Dec 30, 2016, 10:42 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"London, UK","name":"Sky News Newsdesk","screen_name":"SkyNewsBreak","tweet_id":"814962019598213120","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/596405103181062144\/UEIEADT0_normal.png","user_id":"87416722","content":"Olympic gold medallists Andy Murray and Mo Farah have been awarded knighthoods in the new year honours list","date":"2016-12-30T22:31:01","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsBreak\/status\/814962019598213120","id":755287},"url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-12-30T22:45:13.370293","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1065661\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tom","username":"tom.brew","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","id":7,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":1065661,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/30\/olympic-gold-medal-winners-andy-murray-and-mo"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/12\/30\/olympic-gold-medallists-katherine-grainger-and-2","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Olympic gold medallists Katherine Grainger and Jessica Ennis-Hill are made dames in the new year honors list - Sky News","whoas":30,"content":"Olympic gold medallists Katherine Grainger and Jessica Ennis-Hill are made dames in the new year honors list - Sky News","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsBreak\/status\/814961910680526848","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","links":"","id":30,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","latitude":54.314072,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/jessica-ennis\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:38:03.134605","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jessica_Ennis-Hill\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:23:49.940916","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"jessica-ennis","created_on":"2012-08-03T09:44:09","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Edm","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=17212","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jessica_Ennis-Hill","name":"Jessica Ennis-Hill","image_height":768,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":12,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/30\/Jessica_Ennis_100_m.jpg\/512px-Jessica_Ennis_100_m.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/17212\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Jessica Ennis-Hill<\/b>, CBE (<i>née<\/i> <b>Ennis<\/b>; born 28 January 1986) is a retired British track and field athlete from England, specialising in multi-eventing disciplines and 100 metres hurdles.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2iOn5rr","longitude":null,"slug":"olympic-gold-medallists-katherine-grainger-and-2","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsBreak\/status\/814961910680526848","date":"2016-12-30T22:38:03.134605","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EdOB","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Dec 30, 2016, 10:38 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"London, UK","name":"Sky News Newsdesk","screen_name":"SkyNewsBreak","tweet_id":"814961910680526848","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/596405103181062144\/UEIEADT0_normal.png","user_id":"87416722","content":"Olympic gold medallists Katherine Grainger and Jessica Ennis-Hill have been made dames in the new year honours list","date":"2016-12-30T22:30:35","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsBreak\/status\/814961910680526848","id":755281},"url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-12-30T22:38:04.041704","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1065657\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tom","username":"tom.brew","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","id":7,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":1065657,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/30\/olympic-gold-medallists-katherine-grainger-and-2"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/12\/12\/irish-olympic-official-pat-hickey-told-he-can","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Irish Olympic official Pat Hickey told he can leave Rio after judge grants passport return - Irish Independent","whoas":21,"content":"Irish Olympic official Pat Hickey told he can leave Rio after judge grants passport return - Irish Independent","url":"http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/irish-news\/courts\/pat-hickey-told-he-can-leave-rio-after-judge-grants-passport-return-35287227.html","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Fiji, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan, Ivory Coast and Vietnam each won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).<\/p>","links":"","id":2418,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2418"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:35:59.845995","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Town","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:41:06.239876","kind":"location","longitude":-43.19508,"slug":"rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br","created_on":"2010-08-03T19:39:55","geohash":"75cm314r10xj","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/YW","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1510","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro","name":"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil","image_height":614,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":545,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/94\/Montagem_RJ.jpg\/512px-Montagem_RJ.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1510\/","active":true,"woeid":455825,"category":"Town","description":"<p><b>Rio de Janeiro<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/iː\/ long 'e' in 'seed'\">iː<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ɛər\/ 'are' in 'bare'\">ɛər<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span>, <span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><\/span>, <span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; <small>Portuguese pronunciation: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈʁi.u d(ʒi) ʒɐˈnejɾu]<\/span>; <i>River of January<\/i>), or simply <b>Rio<\/b>, is the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"<i>Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea<\/i>\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (IBGE, 2008) (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations—Petrobras and Vale—and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of <i>Christ the Redeemer<\/i> atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the <i>Sambódromo<\/i> (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracanã Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games.<\/p>","links":"","id":1510,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br\/","latitude":-22.97673,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1510"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/international-olympic-committee\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-15T14:47:29.937597","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Olympic_Committee\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:36:41.844428","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"international-olympic-committee","created_on":"2011-04-06T17:05:31","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BDz","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4081","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Olympic_Committee","name":"International Olympic Committee","image_height":357,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":265,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/32\/Albert_Meyer_4_Olympia_1896.jpg\/512px-Albert_Meyer_4_Olympia_1896.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4081\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Organization","description":"<p>The <b>International Olympic Committee<\/b> (<b>IOC<\/b>; French: <b>Comité international olympique<\/b>, <b>CIO<\/b>) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/pat-hickey\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-12T14:46:48.371704","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-15T00:01:04.411317","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"pat-hickey","created_on":"2016-07-17T03:21:35.106807","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bcu1","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=348865","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pat_Hickey_(sports_administrator)","name":"Pat Hickey","image_height":null,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":16,"daily_count":0,"image_width":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/348865\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Patrick Joseph \"Pat\" Hickey<\/b> (born 17 June 1945) is an Irish sports administrator.

Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2hpf0Wu","longitude":null,"slug":"irish-olympic-official-pat-hickey-told-he-can","url_text":"Read more on independent.ie","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/irish-news\/courts\/pat-hickey-told-he-can-leave-rio-after-judge-grants-passport-return-35287227.html","date":"2016-12-12T14:46:48.371704","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EXuD","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Dec 12, 2016, 02:46 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"independent.ie","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-12-12T14:46:49.671362","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1044579\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on independent.ie","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"David","username":"david.wyllie","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/12\/","full_name":"David Wyllie","email":"david.wyllie@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Wyllie","id":12,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":1044579,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/12\/irish-olympic-official-pat-hickey-told-he-can"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/12\/09\/federal-judge-in-philadelphia-to-rule-monday-on","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Federal judge in Philadelphia to rule Monday on Green Party-backed petition for Pennsylvania recount, 1 day before vote certification - Philly Inquirer","whoas":18,"content":"Federal judge in Philadelphia to rule Monday on Green Party-backed petition for Pennsylvania recount, 1 day before vote certification - Philly Inquirer","url":"http:\/\/www.philly.com\/philly\/news\/20161210_Philly_judge__Decison_coming_Monday_on_Stein_s_petition_for_statewide_recount.html","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Pennsylvania has 51 miles (82 km) of coastline along Lake Erie and 57 miles (92 km) of shoreline along the Delaware Estuary.<\/p>\n<p>The state is one of the 13 original founding states of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787.

In the Northeastern United States, at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valley, a metropolitan area home to 7.2 million people and the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>In 1682, William Penn founded the city to serve as capital of the Pennsylvania Colony. Philadelphia played an instrumental role in the American Revolution as a meeting place for the Founding Fathers of the United States, who signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the Constitution in 1787. Philadelphia was one of the nation's capitals in the Revolutionary War, and served as temporary U.S. capital while Washington, D.C., was under construction. In the 19th century, Philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of European immigrants. It became a prime destination for African-Americans in the Great Migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the similar shifts underway the nation's economy in the late 1960s Philadelphia experienced a loss of manufacturing companies and jobs to lower taxed regions of the USA and often overseas. As a result, the economic base of Philadelphia, which had historically been manufacturing, declined significantly. In addition, consolidation in several American industries (retailing, financial services and health care in particular) reduced the number of companies headquartered in Philadelphia. The economic impact of these changes would reduce Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government. Philadelphia struggled through a long period of adjustment to these economic changes, coupled with significant demographic change as wealthier residents moved into the nearby suburbs and more immigrants moved into the city. The city in fact approached bankruptcy in the late 1980s. Revitalization began in the late 1990s, with gentrification turning around many neighborhoods and reversing its decades-long trend of population loss.<\/p>\n<p>The area's many universities and colleges make Philadelphia a top international study destination, as the city has evolved into an educational and economic hub. With a gross domestic product of $388 billion, Philadelphia ranks ninth among world cities and fourth in the nation. Philadelphia is the center of economic activity in Pennsylvania and is home to seven Fortune 1000 companies. The Philadelphia skyline is growing, with a market of almost 81,900 commercial properties in 2016 including several nationally prominent skyscrapers. The city is known for its arts, culture, and history, attracting over 39 million domestic tourists in 2013. Philadelphia has more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other American city, and Fairmount Park is the largest landscaped urban park in the world. The 67 National Historic Landmarks in the city helped account for the $10 billion generated by tourism. Philadelphia is the birthplace of the United States Marine Corps, and is also the home of many U.S. firsts, including the first library (1731), first hospital (1751) and medical school (1765), first Capitol (1777), first stock exchange (1790), first zoo (1874), and first business school (1881). Philadelphia is the only World Heritage City in the United States.<\/p>","links":"","id":341,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/philadelphia-pa-us\/","latitude":40.007629,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=341"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/green-party\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-12T14:58:46.499700","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Green_party\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-23T01:02:10.650550","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"green-party","created_on":"2010-06-24T22:17:57","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FfT","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21161","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Green_party","name":"Green Party","image_height":300,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":85,"daily_count":0,"image_width":200,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/3\/3b\/Daniel_Br%C3%A9laz_%281982%29_by_Erling_Mandelmann.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/21161\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"PoliticalParty","description":"<p>A <b>Green party<\/b> is a formally organized political party based on the principles of green politics, such as social justice, environmentalism and nonviolence.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/politics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:01:05.277991","twitter_username":"breakingpol","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.906700","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"politics","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:19","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":2,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Politics","name":"politics","image_height":503,"recent_count":5,"facebookchat":"","item_count":96331,"daily_count":27,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":2,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6a\/Inglehart_Values_Map.svg\/512px-Inglehart_Values_Map.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i><\/span>, definition \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the process of making decisions applying to all members of each group. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2gtS49D","longitude":null,"slug":"federal-judge-in-philadelphia-to-rule-monday-on","url_text":"Read more on philly.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.philly.com\/philly\/news\/20161210_Philly_judge__Decison_coming_Monday_on_Stein_s_petition_for_statewide_recount.html","date":"2016-12-09T21:55:30.165214","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EXHC","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Dec 09, 2016, 09:55 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"philly.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-12-09T21:55:30.835377","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/1042160\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on philly.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Imana","username":"imana.gunawan","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/31\/","full_name":"Imana Gunawan","email":"Imana.Gunawan@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Gunawan","id":31,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":1042160,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/12\/09\/federal-judge-in-philadelphia-to-rule-monday-on"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/12\/09\/urgente-justica-bloqueia-bens-de-eduardo-paes","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Court blocks assets of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, who is accused of impropriety in the construction of Olympic golf course - Estadao","whoas":17,"content":"Court blocks assets of Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, who is accused of impropriety in the construction of Olympic golf course - Estadao","url":"http:\/\/politica.estadao.com.br\/noticias\/geral,justica-bloqueia-bens-de-eduardo-paes-em-acao-sobre-improbidade-administrativa,10000093553","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:35:59.845995","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Town","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:41:06.239876","kind":"location","longitude":-43.19508,"slug":"rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br","created_on":"2010-08-03T19:39:55","geohash":"75cm314r10xj","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/YW","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1510","visible":true,"primary":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro","name":"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil","image_height":614,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":545,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/94\/Montagem_RJ.jpg\/512px-Montagem_RJ.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1510\/","active":true,"woeid":455825,"category":"Town","description":"<p><b>Rio de Janeiro<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/iː\/ long 'e' in 'seed'\">iː<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ɛər\/ 'are' in 'bare'\">ɛər<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span>, <span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><\/span>, <span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; <small>Portuguese pronunciation: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈʁi.u d(ʒi) ʒɐˈnejɾu]<\/span>; <i>River of January<\/i>), or simply <b>Rio<\/b>, is the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"<i>Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea<\/i>\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (IBGE, 2008) (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations—Petrobras and Vale—and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon.

With 306 sets of medals, the games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city, and at five in São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.<\/p>\n<p>These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.

As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 km (4,655 mi). It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral, who claimed the area for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808, when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military <i>coup d'état<\/i>. An authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic. The federation is composed of the union of the Federal District, the 26 states, and the 5,570 municipalities.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil's economy is the world's ninth-largest by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by GDP (PPP) as of 2015. A member of the BRICS group, Brazil until 2010 had one of the world's fastest growing major economies, with its economic reforms giving the country new international recognition and influence. Brazil's national development bank plays an important role for the country's economic growth. Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, Unasul, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States, CPLP, and the Latin Union. Brazil is a regional power in Latin America and a middle power in international affairs, with some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power. One of the world's major breadbaskets, Brazil has been the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.<\/p>","links":"","id":536,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/brazil\/","latitude":-14.2429,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=536"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/eduardo-paes\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-09T18:01:34.123889","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eduardo_Paes\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T02:10:09.724008","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"eduardo-paes","created_on":"2012-09-10T18:24:38","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/F3J","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=22639","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eduardo_Paes","name":"Eduardo Paes","image_height":771,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":5,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/8e\/Foto_oficial_de_Eduardo_Paes.jpg\/512px-Foto_oficial_de_Eduardo_Paes.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/22639\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Eduardo da Costa Paes<\/b> (<small>Brazilian Portuguese: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[eˈdwaʁdu dɐ ˈkɔstɐ pɐjs]<\/span>, born 14 November 1969) is a Brazilian politician who is the mayor of the city of Rio de Janeiro, having defeated Fernando Gabeira in the 2008 Elections.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:12:42.847151","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.246535","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"crime-courts","created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":1,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","name":"crime & courts","image_height":337,"recent_count":13,"facebookchat":"","item_count":104890,"daily_count":51,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":1,"ping_category":[{"slug":"police-activity","name":"Police activity","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/ping_categories\/10\/","id":10,"aliases":["police","cop","riot","swat","fbi","raid"],"symbol":"🚔","description":"Whenever you see the police responding to a call or at the scene"}],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6e\/Pentonvilleiso19.jpg\/512px-Pentonvilleiso19.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p>In ordinary language, a <b>crime<\/b> is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.

The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.

Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting.

Russia has had the most (31) Olympic medals stripped for doping violations – nearly triple the number of the second country. From 2011 to 2015, more than a thousand Russian competitors in various sports, including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports, benefited from a cover-up.<\/p>\n<p>Media attention began growing in December 2014 when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report in November 2015 which was highly critical of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) and the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF). In November 2015, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events due to widespread doping.<\/p>\n<p>Following allegations by a Russian former lab director about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren. McLaren's investigation found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\". In response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code and recommended that Russia be banned from competing at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The International Olympic Commission (IOC) rejected that recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis. On 4 August 2016, one day prior to the opening ceremony, 270 athletes were cleared for competition, while 167 were removed because of doping. In contrast to the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, having found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.<\/p>","links":"","id":305010,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russian-athlete-doping-scandal\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=305010"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/romania\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T12:15:50.657762","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Romania\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:42:55.691423","kind":"location","longitude":24.9804,"slug":"romania","created_on":"2011-04-25T16:56:37","geohash":"u81v2kqhjdbq","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ng","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=838","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Romania","name":"Romania","image_height":341,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":216,"daily_count":1,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/73\/Flag_of_Romania.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/838\/","active":true,"woeid":23424933,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Romania<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i>roh-<b><span><span>MAY<\/span><\/span><\/b>-nee-ə<\/i><\/span>; Romanian: <span lang=\"ro\"><i>România<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[romɨˈni.a]<\/span>) is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of 238,391 square kilometres (92,043 sq mi) and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh most populous member state of the European Union. Its capital and largest city, Bucharest, is the sixth largest city in the EU.<\/p>\n<p>The River Danube, Europe's second longest river, rises in Germany and flows southeastwards for a distance of 2,857 km, coursing through ten countries before emptying in Romania's Danube Delta. The Carpathian Mountains, with their tallest peak Moldoveanu at 2,544 m (8,346 ft), cross Romania from the north to the southwest.<\/p>\n<p>Modern Romania emerged within the territories of the ancient Roman province of Dacia, and was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. During World War II, Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, fighting side by side with the Wehrmacht until 1944, when it then joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the Red Army forces. Romania lost several territories, of which Northern Transylvania was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a socialist republic and member of the Warsaw Pact. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition back towards democracy and a capitalist market economy.<\/p>\n<p>Following rapid economic growth in the early 2000s, Romania has an economy predominantly based on services, and is a producer and net exporter of machines and electric energy, featuring companies like Automobile Dacia and OMV Petrom. It has been a member of NATO since 2004, and part of the European Union since 2007. A strong majority of the population identify themselves as Eastern Orthodox Christians and are native speakers of Romanian, a Romance language. With a rich cultural history, Romania has been the home of influential artists, musicians, inventors and sportspeople, and features a variety of tourist attractions.<\/p>","links":"","id":838,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/romania\/","latitude":45.946949,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=838"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/russia\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:38:39.507079","kind":"location","longitude":108.830719,"slug":"russia","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:11:27","geohash":"y6t6hx0r6pe7","trend_rank_last":43,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BZ","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia","name":"Russia","image_height":341,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":10245,"daily_count":7,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":44,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/f\/f3\/Flag_of_Russia.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/87\/","active":true,"woeid":23424936,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Russia<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"\/ʃ\/ 'sh' in 'shy'\">ʃ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Russian: <span lang=\"ru\">Росси́я<\/span>, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossija<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[rɐˈsʲijə]<\/span>; from the Greek: <span lang=\"el\">Ρωσία<\/span> — Rus'), also officially known as the <b>Russian Federation<\/b> (Russian: <span lang=\"ru\">Росси́йская Федера́ция<\/span>, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossijskaja Federacija<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨjə]<\/span>), is a federal state in Eurasia. At 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.<\/p>\n<p>Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power as well as a regional power and has been characterised as a potential superpower. It is permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and one of the five members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), along with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.<\/p>","links":"","id":87,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russia\/","latitude":59.453751,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=87"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/court-of-arbitration-for-sport\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-08T23:05:52.711658","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:48:23.515501","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"court-of-arbitration-for-sport","created_on":"2014-07-14T17:30:40.517874","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/S3K","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=72612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport","name":"Court of Arbitration for Sport","image_height":341,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":73,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/c1\/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport_-_Lausanne_2.jpg\/512px-Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport_-_Lausanne_2.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/72612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Organization","description":"<p>The <b>Court of Arbitration for Sport<\/b> (<b>CAS<\/b>; French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Tribunal arbitral du sport<\/i><\/span>, TAS) is an international quasi-judicial body established to settle disputes related to sport through arbitration.

The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements.

The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events.

Russia has had the most (31) Olympic medals stripped for doping violations – nearly triple the number of the second country. From 2011 to 2015, more than a thousand Russian competitors in various sports, including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports, benefited from a cover-up.<\/p>\n<p>Media attention began growing in December 2014 when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report in November 2015 which was highly critical of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) and the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF). In November 2015, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events due to widespread doping.<\/p>\n<p>Following allegations by a Russian former lab director about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren. McLaren's investigation found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the Federal Security Service (FSB) had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\". In response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code and recommended that Russia be banned from competing at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The International Olympic Commission (IOC) rejected that recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis. On 4 August 2016, one day prior to the opening ceremony, 270 athletes were cleared for competition, while 167 were removed because of doping. In contrast to the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, having found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.<\/p>","links":"","id":305010,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russian-athlete-doping-scandal\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=305010"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:35:59.845995","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Town","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:41:06.239876","kind":"location","longitude":-43.19508,"slug":"rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br","created_on":"2010-08-03T19:39:55","geohash":"75cm314r10xj","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/YW","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1510","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rio_de_Janeiro","name":"Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil","image_height":614,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":545,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/94\/Montagem_RJ.jpg\/512px-Montagem_RJ.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1510\/","active":true,"woeid":455825,"category":"Town","description":"<p><b>Rio de Janeiro<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/iː\/ long 'e' in 'seed'\">iː<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/ɛər\/ 'are' in 'bare'\">ɛər<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><\/span>, <span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/ʒ\/ 's' in 'pleasure'\">ʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><\/span>, <span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/-\/ affix\">-<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; <small>Portuguese pronunciation: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈʁi.u d(ʒi) ʒɐˈnejɾu]<\/span>; <i>River of January<\/i>), or simply <b>Rio<\/b>, is the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"<i>Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea<\/i>\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (IBGE, 2008) (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations—Petrobras and Vale—and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of <i>Christ the Redeemer<\/i> atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the <i>Sambódromo<\/i> (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city.

At 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.<\/p>\n<p>Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power as well as a regional power and has been characterised as a potential superpower. It is permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and one of the five members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), along with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.<\/p>","links":"","id":87,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russia\/","latitude":59.453751,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=87"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/international-olympic-committee\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-15T14:47:29.937597","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Olympic_Committee\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:36:41.844428","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"international-olympic-committee","created_on":"2011-04-06T17:05:31","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BDz","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4081","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/International_Olympic_Committee","name":"International Olympic Committee","image_height":357,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":265,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/32\/Albert_Meyer_4_Olympia_1896.jpg\/512px-Albert_Meyer_4_Olympia_1896.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4081\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Organization","description":"<p>The <b>International Olympic Committee<\/b> (<b>IOC<\/b>; French: <b>Comité international olympique<\/b>, <b>CIO<\/b>) is the supreme authority of the worldwide Olympic movement.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented.

With 306 sets of medals, the games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city, and at five in São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília, and Manaus.<\/p>\n<p>These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. The host city Rio de Janeiro was announced at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009. Rio became the first South American city to host the Summer Olympics.

Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","latitude":37.167931,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/gymnastics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-26T18:03:30.319379","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gymnastics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:34:37.309844","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"gymnastics","created_on":"2012-06-03T19:47:38","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BiH","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5959","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gymnastics","name":"gymnastics","image_height":347,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":117,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/23\/Daniele_Hyp%C3%B3lito_16072007.jpg\/512px-Daniele_Hyp%C3%B3lito_16072007.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5959\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Sport","description":"<p><b>Gymnastics<\/b> is a sport involving the performance of exercises requiring balance strength, flexibility, agility, endurance and control.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators.

It is the second-largest pay-TV company after the AT&amp;T-DirecTV acquisition, largest cable TV company and largest home Internet service provider in the United States, and the nation's third-largest home telephone service provider. Comcast services U.S. residential and commercial customers in 40 states and in the District of Columbia. The company's headquarters are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As the owner of the international media company NBCUniversal since 2011, Comcast is a producer of feature films and television programs intended for theatrical exhibition and over-the-air and cable television broadcast.<\/p>\n<p>Comcast operates over-the-air national broadcast network channels (NBC and Telemundo), multiple cable-only channels (including MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, NBCSN, E!, The Weather Channel, among others), the film production studio Universal Pictures, and Universal Parks &amp; Resorts in Los Angeles and Orlando. The first Universal theme park outside of the U.S., Universal Studios Japan, opened in 2001, followed by Universal Studios Singapore in 2011. Few new locations are being planned or developed for future operation. Comcast also has significant holdings in digital distribution (thePlatform). In February 2014 the company agreed to merge with Time Warner Cable in an equity swap deal worth $45.2 billion. Under the terms of the agreement Comcast was to acquire 100% of Time Warner Cable. However, on April 24, 2015, Comcast terminated the agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Comcast has been criticized for multiple reasons. The company's customer satisfaction often ranks among the lowest in the cable industry. Comcast has violated net neutrality practices in the past; and, despite Comcast's commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality, critics advocate a definition of which precludes distinction between Comcast's private network services and the rest of the Internet. Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service area; there is limited competition among cable providers. Given Comcast's negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and content distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues, in addition to others, led to Comcast being dubbed \"The Worst Company in America\" by <i>The Consumerist<\/i> in 2010 and 2014.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being publicly-traded, Comcast is a family-owned business, with the Roberts family owning a controlling stake and multiple generations serving as company executives<\/p>","links":"","id":2427,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/comcast\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2427"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/earnings\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-21T21:31:27.460266","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:52:21.707067","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"earnings","created_on":"2012-09-27T20:15:35","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":321,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/FsU","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=21968","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_statement","name":"earnings","image_height":269,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":3012,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":318,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/49\/Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg\/512px-Hauptbuch_Hochstetter_vor_1828.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/21968\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p>An <b>income statement<\/b> (US English) or <b>profit and loss account<\/b> (UK English) (also referred to as a <i><b>profit and loss statement<\/b><\/i> (P&amp;L), <i><b>statement of profit or loss<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>revenue statement<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>statement of financial performance<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>earnings statement<\/b><\/i>, <i><b>operating statement<\/b><\/i>, or <i><b>statement of operations<\/b><\/i>) is one of the financial statements of a company and shows the company’s revenues and expenses during a particular period. It indicates how the revenues (money received from the sale of products and services before expenses are taken out, also known as the “top line”) are transformed into the net income (the result after all revenues and expenses have been accounted for, also known as “net profit” or the “bottom line”). It displays the revenues recognized for a specific period, and the cost and expenses charged against these revenues, including write-offs (e.g., depreciation and amortization of various assets) and taxes. The purpose of the income statement is to show managers and investors whether the company made or lost money during the period being reported.<\/p>\n<p>One important thing to remember about an income statement is that it represents a period of time like the cash flow statement. This contrasts with the balance sheet, which represents a single moment in time.<\/p>\n<p>Charitable organizations that are required to publish financial statements do not produce an income statement. Instead, they produce a similar statement that reflects funding sources compared against program expenses, administrative costs, and other operating commitments. This statement is commonly referred to as the statement of activities. Revenues and expenses are further categorized in the statement of activities by the donor restrictions on the funds received and expended.<\/p>\n<p>The income statement can be prepared in one of two methods. The Single Step income statement takes the simpler approach, totaling revenues and subtracting expenses to find the bottom line. The more complex Multi-Step income statement (as the name implies) takes several steps to find the bottom line, starting with the gross profit. It then calculates operating expenses and, when deducted from the gross profit, yields income from operations. Adding to income from operations is the difference of other revenues and other expenses. When combined with income from operations, this yields income before taxes. The final step is to deduct taxes, which finally produces the net income for the period measured.<\/p>","links":"","id":21968,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/earnings\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=21968"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:17:44.190137","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"olympics","created_on":"2010-05-28T03:03:15","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J2","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games","name":"Olympics","image_height":292,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2070,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg\/512px-Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The modern <b>Olympic Games<\/b> or <b>Olympics<\/b> (French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Jeux olympiques<\/i><\/span>) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/telephones\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-29T15:10:50.172662","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Telecommunication\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T16:35:13.710384","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"telephones","created_on":"2014-10-13T16:20:23.890060","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Wfd","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=86519","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Telecommunication","name":"telecommunications","image_height":461,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":951,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/40\/Erdfunkstelle_Raisting_2.jpg\/512px-Erdfunkstelle_Raisting_2.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/86519\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Telecommunication<\/b> is the transmission of signs, signals, messages, writings, images and sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic systems. Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology.

Such transmission paths are often divided into communication channels which afford the advantages of multiplexing. The term is often used in its plural form, <b>telecommunications<\/b>, because it involves many different technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Early means of communicating over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs.

It can refer to a television set, a television program (\"TV show\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but these did not sell to the public. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries. The availability of storage media such as Betamax (1975), VHS tape (1976), DVDs (1997), and high-definition Blu-ray Discs (2006) enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material at home, such as movies. At the end of the first decade of the 2000s, digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity. Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher. HDTV may be transmitted in various formats: 1080p, 1080i and 720p. Since 2010, with the invention of smart television, Internet television has increased the availability of television programs and movies via the Internet through streaming video services such as Netflix, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku and Chromecast.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, 79% of the world's households owned a television set. The replacement of early bulky, high-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays with compact, energy-efficient, flat-panel alternative technologies such as plasma displays, LCDs (both fluorescent-backlit and LED), and OLED displays was a hardware revolution that began with computer monitors in the late 1990s. Most TV sets sold in the 2000s were flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s. LEDs are expected to be replaced gradually by OLEDs in the near future. Also, major manufacturers have announced that they will increasingly produce smart TV sets in the mid-2010s. Smart TVs with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 functions became the dominant form of television by the late 2010s.<\/p>\n<p>Television signals were initially distributed only as terrestrial television using high-powered radio-frequency transmitters to broadcast the signal to individual television receivers. Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet. Until the early 2000s, these were transmitted as analog signals but countries started switching to digital, this transition is expected to be completed worldwide by late 2010s. A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals. A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.<\/p>","links":"","id":109,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/television\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=109"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/business\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:23:05.887814","twitter_username":"breakingmoney","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:54:43.049661","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"business","created_on":"2012-10-24T00:05:56","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":4,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/H","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Business","name":"business","image_height":683,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":55977,"daily_count":5,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":4,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/87\/Downtownplazala.jpg\/512px-Downtownplazala.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p>A <b>business<\/b> (also known as an <b>enterprise<\/b>, a <b>company<\/b> or a <b>firm<\/b>) is an organizational entity involved in the provision of goods and services to consumers.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","links":"","id":75,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/entertainment\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/on.wsj.com\/2ff2haH","longitude":null,"slug":"comcast-reports-strong-earnings-powered-by-rio","url_text":"Read more on www.wsj.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/comcast-reports-strong-earnings-powered-by-rio-olympics-1477479640","date":"2016-10-26T11:24:45.859463","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EI3c","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Oct 26, 2016, 11:24 AM GMT","tweet":{"location":"New York, NY","name":"Wall Street Journal","screen_name":"WSJ","tweet_id":"791238121950183424","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/685113343204585473\/jV72Zljq_normal.jpg","user_id":"3108351","content":"Comcast reports strong earnings, powered by Rio Olympics; Cable giant adds 32,000 video customers https:\/\/t.co\/Bs8mEdRbWu 🔓","date":"2016-10-26T11:20:43","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WSJ\/status\/791238121950183424","id":693068},"url_domain":"www.wsj.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-10-26T14:23:58.732265","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/987502\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on www.wsj.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Rebecca","username":"rebecca.bratek","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Bratek","id":29,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":987502,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/26\/comcast-reports-strong-earnings-powered-by-rio"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/18\/britains-olympic-and-paralympic-athletes-honored","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes honored with celebration in London's Trafalgar Square - BBC Sports","whoas":13,"content":"Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes honored with celebration in London's Trafalgar Square - BBC Sports","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-london-37679019","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded – probably close to an already existing Celtic Briton village or settlement – around the year 43 by the Romans, who named it <i>Londinium<\/i>. London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km<sup>2<\/sup>) medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \"London\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.<\/p>\n<p>As a Nylonkong metropolis, London is a leading global city, in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transport. It is one of the world's leading financial centres and has the fifth- or sixth-largest metropolitan area GDP in the world. London is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe, and a 2014 report placed it first in the world university rankings. According to the report London also ranks first in the world in software, multimedia development and design, and shares first position in technology readiness. In 2012, London became the only city to have hosted the modern Summer Olympic Games three times.<\/p>\n<p>London has a diverse range of people and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken in the region. Its estimated mid-2015 municipal population (corresponding to Greater London) was 8,673,713, the largest of any city in the European Union, and accounting for 12.5 per cent of the UK population. London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants at the 2011 census. The city's metropolitan area is one of the most populous in Europe with 13,879,757 inhabitants, while the Greater London Authority states the population of the <i>city-region<\/i> (covering a large part of the south east) as 22.7 million. London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.<\/p>\n<p>London contains four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the site comprising the Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and the historic settlement of Greenwich (in which the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° longitude, and GMT). Other famous landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar Square, and The Shard. London is home to numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events and other cultural institutions, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library and West End theatres. The London Underground is the oldest underground railway network in the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":165,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/london-england-gb\/","latitude":51.506401,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=165"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/trafalgar-square-london-england-gb\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-10-18T15:57:04.589066","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trafalgar_Square\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"POI","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:51:40.348029","kind":"location","longitude":-0.12799,"slug":"trafalgar-square-london-england-gb","created_on":"2012-03-08T17:35:56","geohash":"gcpvj0dzce5u","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CvK","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trafalgar_Square","name":"Trafalgar Square, London, England, United Kingdom","image_height":339,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":47,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/a\/a6\/Trafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg\/512px-Trafalgar_Square%2C_London_2_-_Jun_2009.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10612\/","active":true,"woeid":22476510,"category":"POI","description":"<p><b>Trafalgar Square<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˌ\/ secondary stress follows\">ˌ<\/span><span title=\"'t' in 'tie'\">t<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'f' in 'find'\">f<\/span><span title=\"\/æ\/ short 'a' in 'bad'\">æ<\/span><span title=\"'l' in 'lie'\">l<\/span><span title=\"'g' in 'guy'\">ɡ<\/span><span title=\"\/ər\/ 'er' in 'finger'\">ər<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i>trə-<b><span><span>FAL<\/span><\/span><\/b>-gər<\/i><\/span>) is a public square in the City of Westminster, Central London, built around the area formerly known as Charing Cross. Its name commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, a British naval victory in the Napoleonic Wars with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of Cape Trafalgar, Spain.<\/p>\n<p>The site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the King's Mews. After George IV moved the mews to Buckingham Palace, the area was redeveloped by John Nash but progress was slow after his death and the square did not open until 1844. The 169-foot (52 m) Nelson's Column at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square but the Fourth Plinth, left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.<\/p>\n<p>The square has been used for community gatherings and political demonstrations including Bloody Sunday, the first Aldermaston March, anti-war protests, and campaigns against climate change. A Christmas tree has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on New Year's Eve. It was well known for its feral pigeons until their removal in the early 21st century.<\/p>","links":"","id":10612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/trafalgar-square-london-england-gb\/","latitude":51.508,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","kind":"location","longitude":-2.23001,"slug":"united-kingdom","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","trend_rank_last":86,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","name":"United Kingdom","image_height":256,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":12097,"daily_count":1,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":86,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","active":true,"woeid":23424975,"category":"Country","description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/2eramWF","longitude":null,"slug":"britains-olympic-and-paralympic-athletes-honored","url_text":"Read more on www.bbc.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/uk-england-london-37679019","date":"2016-10-18T15:57:04.589066","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EGwn","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Oct 18, 2016, 03:57 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"www.bbc.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-10-18T15:57:06.310875","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/979391\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on www.bbc.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Shelley","username":"shelley.ng","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/30\/","full_name":"Shelley Ng","email":"shelley.ng@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Ng","id":30,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":979391,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/18\/britains-olympic-and-paralympic-athletes-honored"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/17\/video-uks-paralympians-olympians-parade-in","media":{"html":"<video id=\"my-video-978507\" class=\"video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-16-9\" controls preload=\"auto\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" poster=\"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/ext_tw_video_thumb\/788041588840796160\/pu\/img\/DE38uKWOxkwl9nQB.jpg:thumb\">                                           <source src=\"https:\/\/video.twimg.com\/ext_tw_video\/788041588840796160\/pu\/vid\/320x180\/k6V1xcrG86NJ47dw.mp4\" type=\"video\/mp4\">                                           <source src=\"\" type=\"video\/webm\">                                           <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http:\/\/videojs.com\/html5-video-support\/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video<\/a><\/p>                                         <\/video>","thumbnail_width":150,"width":1024,"original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ParalympicsGB\/status\/788041831783292928\/video\/1","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ParalympicsGB","thumbnail_height":150,"height":576,"provider_name":"Twitter","id":184477,"type":"video","author_name":"ParalympicsGB","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","title":"Happy Mondays!

It lies within the United Kingdom's second-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.55 million. Manchester is fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south, the Pennines to the north and east and an arc of towns with which it forms a continuous conurbation. The local authority is Manchester City Council.<\/p>\n<p>The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian settlement associated with the Roman fort of <i>Mamucium<\/i> or <i>Mancunium<\/i>, which was established in about 79 AD on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. It was historically a part of Lancashire, although areas of Cheshire south of the River Mersey were incorporated during the 20th century. Throughout the Middle Ages Manchester remained a manorial township but began to expand \"at an astonishing rate\" around the turn of the 19th century. Manchester's unplanned urbanisation was brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and resulted in it becoming the world's first industrialised city.<\/p>\n<p>Manchester achieved city status in 1853. The Manchester Ship Canal opened in 1894, creating the Port of Manchester and linking the city to sea, 36 miles (58 km) to the west. Its fortunes declined after the Second World War, owing to deindustrialisation. The city centre was devastated in a bombing in 1996, but it led to extensive investment and regeneration that has since helped it turn into a thriving 'reborn' modern city.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, the Globalization and World Cities Research Network ranked Manchester as a beta world city, the highest-ranked British city apart from London. Manchester is the third-most visited city in the UK. It is notable for its architecture, culture, musical exports, media links, scientific and engineering output, social impact, sports clubs and transport connections. Manchester Liverpool Road railway station was the world's first inter-city passenger railway station and in the city scientists first split the atom and developed the stored-program computer.<\/p>","links":"","id":250,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/manchester-england-gb\/","latitude":53.466702,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=250"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T00:06:58.948514","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:25:10.490968","kind":"location","longitude":-2.23001,"slug":"united-kingdom","created_on":"2011-05-16T17:43:35","geohash":"gcwkvr84t404","trend_rank_last":86,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/e","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=30","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_Kingdom","name":"United Kingdom","image_height":256,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":12097,"daily_count":1,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":86,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/ae\/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/30\/","active":true,"woeid":23424975,"category":"Country","description":"<p>The <b>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland<\/b>, commonly known as the <b>United Kingdom<\/b> (<b>UK<\/b>) or <b>Britain<\/b>, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","links":"","id":30,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","latitude":54.314072,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:17:44.190137","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"olympics","created_on":"2010-05-28T03:03:15","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J2","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games","name":"Olympics","image_height":292,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2070,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg\/512px-Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The modern <b>Olympic Games<\/b> or <b>Olympics<\/b> (French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Jeux olympiques<\/i><\/span>) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/paralympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-09T15:16:33.598842","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paralympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T15:06:23.573169","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"paralympics","created_on":"2012-08-29T15:46:47","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/GGK","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=23446","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paralympic_Games","name":"Paralympics","image_height":385,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":55,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/e\/e6\/IPC_logo_%282004%29.svg\/512px-IPC_logo_%282004%29.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/23446\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>Paralympic Games<\/b> is a major international multi-sport event involving athletes with a range of disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia, muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency (e.g. amputation or dysmelia), leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment.

Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2ed7r4e","longitude":null,"slug":"video-uks-paralympians-olympians-parade-in","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ParalympicsGB\/status\/788041831783292928","date":"2016-10-17T16:01:14.269528","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EGiX","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Oct 17, 2016, 04:01 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"UK","name":"ParalympicsGB","screen_name":"ParalympicsGB","tweet_id":"788041831783292928","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/464030260749541376\/I4Xdwm2f_normal.jpeg","user_id":"39997810","content":"Happy Mondays!

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest metropolis is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.<\/p>\n<p>Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the 16th century, British and French claims were made on the area, with the colony of Canada first being established by the French in 1537. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost territories within British North America until it was left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly geographically comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867, the colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the semi-autonomous federal Dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the mostly self-governing Dominion to the present ten provinces and three territories forming modern Canada.<\/p>\n<p>In 1931, Canada achieved near total independence from the United Kingdom with the Statute of Westminster 1931, and full sovereignty was attained when the Canada Act 1982 removed the last remaining ties of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries. Its advanced economy is the eleventh largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and has the tenth highest nominal per capita income globally as well as the ninth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. Canada is a Commonwealth realm member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a member of the Francophonie, and part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the G8, the Group of Ten, the G20, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.<\/p>","links":"","id":693,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/canada\/","latitude":56.954681,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=693"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/athletics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-26T15:02:36.274584","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport_of_athletics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:48:15.870278","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"athletics","created_on":"2012-08-13T16:21:40","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ho","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=474","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport_of_athletics","name":"athletics","image_height":412,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":882,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/44\/Athletics_competitions.jpg\/512px-Athletics_competitions.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/474\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Sport","description":"<p><b>Athletics<\/b> is a collection of sporting events that involve competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walking. The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross country running, and race walking.<\/p>\n<p>The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts. The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most commonly competed sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.<\/p>\n<p>Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BCE. The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are conducted by the International Association of Athletics Federations and its member federations.<\/p>\n<p>The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics. The foremost international athletics meeting is the IAAF World Championships in Athletics, which incorporates track and field, marathon running and race walking. Other top level competitions in athletics include the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the IPC Athletics World Championships.<\/p>\n<p>The word athletics is derived from the Ancient Greek ἀθλητής (<i>athlētēs<\/i>, \"combatant in public games\") from ἆθλον (<i>athlon<\/i>, \"prize\") or ἆθλος (<i>athlos<\/i>, \"competition\"). Initially, the term was used to describe athletic contests in general – i.e. sporting competition based primarily on human physical feats. In the 19th century, the term athletics acquired a more narrow definition in Europe and came to describe sports involving competitive running, walking, jumping and throwing. This definition continues to be the most prominent one in the United Kingdom and most of the areas of the former British Empire.

It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.<\/p>\n<p>Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.<\/p>\n<p>Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the <i>coca<\/i> plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year. With further processing crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine.<\/p>\n<p>After cannabis, cocaine is the most frequently used illegal drug globally. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. Between one and three percent of people in the developed world use cocaine at some point in their life. In 2013 cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. The leaves of the <i>coca<\/i> plant have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.<\/p>","links":"","id":509,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/cocaine\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=509"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:17:44.190137","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"olympics","created_on":"2010-05-28T03:03:15","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J2","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games","name":"Olympics","image_height":292,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2070,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg\/512px-Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The modern <b>Olympic Games<\/b> or <b>Olympics<\/b> (French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Jeux olympiques<\/i><\/span>) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/shawn-barber\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-10-06T14:59:39.839190","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shawnacy_Barber\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-05T19:01:38.759214","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"shawn-barber","created_on":"2016-10-06T14:59:41.177940","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BfjO","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=359676","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shawnacy_Barber","name":"Shawn Barber","image_height":314,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":1,"daily_count":0,"image_width":189,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/d\/db\/Shawnacy_Barber_%28cropped%29_Beijing_2015.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/359676\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Shawnacy Campbell \"Shawn\" Barber<\/b> (born 27 May 1994) is a Canadian track and field athlete specialising in the pole vault.

Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/on.thestar.com\/2dV8V2h","longitude":null,"slug":"breaking-pole-vaulter-shawn-barber-tested","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/sports\/amateur\/2016\/10\/06\/shawn-barber-tested-positive-for-cocaine-before-rio-olympics.html","date":"2016-10-06T14:59:39.839190","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/EEFO","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Oct 06, 2016, 02:59 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"Toronto, Ontario","name":"CityNews Toronto","screen_name":"CityNews","tweet_id":"784045455814557696","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/736244460410052608\/8TTqlt22_normal.jpg","user_id":"12993222","content":"#BREAKING: Pole vaulter Shawn Barber tested positive for cocaine ahead of Rio Games https:\/\/t.co\/9sd3QGg6mB","date":"2016-10-06T14:59:38","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CityNews\/status\/784045455814557696","id":679838},"url_domain":"thestar.com","submitter":"partner","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-10-06T17:22:41.769811","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/969012\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on twitter.com","source":"streaming-breaking-news-spotting-program-partners","author":{"first_name":"Rebecca","username":"rebecca.bratek","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Bratek","id":29,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":969012,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/06\/breaking-pole-vaulter-shawn-barber-tested"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/10\/05\/english-golfer-and-olympic-champion-justin-rose","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"English golfer and Olympic champion Justin Rose rules himself out for 8 weeks to rest back injury - BBC","whoas":14,"content":"English golfer and Olympic champion Justin Rose rules himself out for 8 weeks to rest back injury - BBC","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/sport\/golf\/37569565","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","links":"","id":30,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","latitude":54.314072,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/golf\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T18:56:59.068834","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golf\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T11:34:00.058149","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"golf","created_on":"2012-12-05T00:24:39","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ge","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=402","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golf","name":"golf","image_height":382,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":587,"daily_count":1,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/6\/6e\/Golfer_swing.jpg\/512px-Golfer_swing.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/402\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Sport","description":"<p><b>Golf<\/b> is a club and ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Golf, unlike most ball games, does not require a standardized playing area.

Each hole on the course must contain a tee box to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup (4.25 inches in width).

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bbc.in\/2cU3mPp","longitude":null,"slug":"english-golfer-and-olympic-champion-justin-rose","url_text":"Read more on www.bbc.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/sport\/golf\/37569565","date":"2016-10-05T19:36:19.704296","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/ED4T","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Oct 05, 2016, 07:36 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"www.bbc.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-10-05T19:36:20.977953","importance":2,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/968335\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on www.bbc.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tom","username":"tom.brew","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","id":7,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":968335,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/10\/05\/english-golfer-and-olympic-champion-justin-rose"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/29\/photo-president-obama-and-first-lady-michelle","media":{"html":"","thumbnail_width":150,"width":624,"original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markknoller\/status\/781537739095306244","author_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/markknoller","thumbnail_height":150,"height":499,"provider_name":"Twitter","id":181465,"type":"photo","author_name":"markknoller","provider_url":"http:\/\/twitter.com","title":"Mark Knoller on Twitter","url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CtiUVCEXEAA49W7.jpg:large","oembed":null,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CtiUVCEXEAA49W7.jpg:thumb"},"status":"published","push_content":"Photo: President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama with gymnast Simone Biles at a White House ceremony honoring the US Olympic and Paralympic teams - @markknoller","whoas":37,"content":"Photo: President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama with gymnast Simone Biles at a White House ceremony honoring the US Olympic and Paralympic teams - @markknoller","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/web\/status\/781537739095306244","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","latitude":37.167931,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/barack-obama\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T01:26:51.834384","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T07:46:35.002951","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"barack-obama","created_on":"2010-05-07T23:31:02","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":20,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/F","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama","name":"Barack Obama","image_height":639,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13293,"daily_count":2,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":20,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/8\/8d\/President_Barack_Obama.jpg\/512px-President_Barack_Obama.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Barack Hussein Obama II<\/b> (<span><small>US<\/small> <span>\/<span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ɑː\/ 'a' in 'father'\">ɑː<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"'h' in 'hi'\">h<\/span><span title=\"\/uː\/ long 'oo' in 'food'\">uː<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'s' in 'sigh'\">s<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><\/span> <span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'b' in 'buy'\">b<\/span><span title=\"\/ɑː\/ 'a' in 'father'\">ɑː<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i>bə-<b><span><span>RAHK<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/i><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i>hoo-<b><span><span>SAYN<\/span><\/span><\/b><\/i><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i>oh-<b><span><span>BAH<\/span><\/span><\/b>-mə<\/i><\/span>; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician and the 44th and current President of the United States. He is the first African American to be elected to that office and the first president born outside the contiguous United States. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. While serving three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, he ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for the United States House of Representatives in 2000 against incumbent Bobby Rush.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his inauguration, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In January 2011, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for greater inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (<i>United States v. Windsor<\/i>) and state level same-sex marriage bans (<i>Obergefell v. Hodges<\/i>) as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.<\/p>","links":"","id":5,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/barack-obama\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/michelle-obama\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T21:57:42.632212","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michelle_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T04:02:28.601395","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"michelle-obama","created_on":"2010-10-06T22:06:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/UP","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1255","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Michelle_Obama","name":"Michelle Obama","image_height":770,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":430,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/4\/4b\/Michelle_Obama_2013_official_portrait.jpg\/512px-Michelle_Obama_2013_official_portrait.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1255\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama<\/b> (born January 17, 1964) is an American lawyer, writer, and First Lady of the United States.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/simone-biles\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-11-09T20:58:05.930801","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simone_Biles\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T16:25:51.111142","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"simone-biles","created_on":"2014-10-10T15:10:13.153648","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WaZ","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=86205","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simone_Biles","name":"Simone Biles","image_height":768,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":25,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/22\/EUA_levam_ouro_na_gin%C3%A1stica_art%C3%ADstica_feminina%3B_Brasil_fica_em_8%C2%BA_lugar_%2828262782114%29.jpg\/512px-EUA_levam_ouro_na_gin%C3%A1stica_art%C3%ADstica_feminina%3B_Brasil_fica_em_8%C2%BA_lugar_%2828262782114%29.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/86205\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Simone Arianne Biles<\/b> (born March 14, 1997) is an American artistic gymnast.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2dpbYOR","longitude":null,"slug":"photo-president-obama-and-first-lady-michelle","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/web\/status\/781537739095306244","date":"2016-09-29T17:01:24.304467","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/ECph","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 29, 2016, 05:01 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"Washington, D.C.","name":"Mark Knoller","screen_name":"markknoller","tweet_id":"781537739095306244","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/137394623\/knoller_normal.jpg","user_id":"31127446","content":"\"Our Olympians came in first more than anybody else,\" trumpets Pres Obama at WH event, citing 46 Gold Medals won by… https:\/\/t.co\/sSywptRIWC","date":"2016-09-29T16:54:51","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markknoller\/status\/781537739095306244","id":676308},"url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":false,"updated_date":"2016-09-29T17:01:25.431886","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/963575\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tom","username":"tom.brew","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/7\/","full_name":"Tom Brew","email":"thomas.brew@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Brew","id":7,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":963575,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/29\/photo-president-obama-and-first-lady-michelle"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/29\/photo-us-olympic-team-visits-white-house-in","media":{"html":"","thumbnail_width":150,"width":2048,"original_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeamUSA\/status\/781498127916367872\/photo\/1","author_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeamUSA","thumbnail_height":150,"height":1706,"provider_name":"Twitter","id":181433,"type":"photo","author_name":"U.S. Olympic Team","provider_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com","title":"#TeamUSA is lookin' good! 😃 🇺🇸 🏅 https:\/\/t.co\/7h0h4a8CR9","url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CthwZY0W8AAEks4.jpg","oembed":{"twitterphoto":{"small_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CthwZY0W8AAEks4.jpg:small","large_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CthwZY0W8AAEks4.jpg:large","upload_thumbnail":null,"large_height":1706,"upload_large":null,"medium_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CthwZY0W8AAEks4.jpg:medium","upload":null,"upload_medium":null,"id":40513,"medium_height":1000,"medium_width":1200,"large_width":2048,"upload_small":null,"small_width":680,"type":"twitterphoto","small_height":566},"twittervideo":null,"id":40513,"instagramvideo":null,"instagramphoto":null,"type":"twitterphoto"},"thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/CthwZY0W8AAEks4.jpg:thumb"},"status":"published","push_content":"Photo: US Olympic team visits White House in Washington, DC - @TeamUSA","whoas":32,"content":"Photo: US Olympic team visits White House in Washington, DC - @TeamUSA","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeamUSA\/status\/781498127916367872","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

Fiji, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan, Ivory Coast and Vietnam each won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).<\/p>","links":"","id":2418,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2418"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","kind":"location","longitude":-95.845016,"slug":"united-states","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","trend_rank_last":8,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","name":"United States","image_height":269,"recent_count":3,"facebookchat":"","item_count":28200,"daily_count":14,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":8,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","active":true,"woeid":23424977,"category":"Country","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>U.S.<\/b>) or <b>America<\/b>, is a federal republic composed of <span>‹See TfD›<\/span>50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","latitude":37.167931,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:17:44.190137","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"olympics","created_on":"2010-05-28T03:03:15","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J2","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games","name":"Olympics","image_height":292,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2070,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg\/512px-Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The modern <b>Olympic Games<\/b> or <b>Olympics<\/b> (French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Jeux olympiques<\/i><\/span>) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/white-house\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T01:51:48.071260","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Executive_Office_of_the_President\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:51:15.511884","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"white-house","created_on":"2010-05-09T12:47:23","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":33,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/CQ","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=140","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Executive_Office_of_the_President","name":"White House (Executive Office of the President of the United States)","image_height":512,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":5166,"daily_count":4,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":32,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/bc\/Seal_of_the_Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States_2014.svg\/512px-Seal_of_the_Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States_2014.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/140\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Organization","description":"<p>The <b>Executive Office of the President of the United States<\/b> (<b>EOPOTUS<\/b> or <b>EOP<\/b>) consists of the immediate staff of the current President of the United States and multiple levels of support staff reporting to the President.

More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance — organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.<\/p>\n<p>A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting or forcing one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>It is very often said that politics is about power. A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society. History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>\n<p>Formal Politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures. Political parties, public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of Formal Politics. Many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves, but that can still affect their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>Informal Politics is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another. Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that \"politics is everywhere\".<\/p>","links":"","id":2,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/2dubUyc","longitude":null,"slug":"photo-us-olympic-team-visits-white-house-in","url_text":"Read more on twitter.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeamUSA\/status\/781498127916367872","date":"2016-09-29T14:29:06.551260","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/ECms","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 29, 2016, 02:29 PM GMT","tweet":{"location":"","name":"U.S. Olympic Team","screen_name":"TeamUSA","tweet_id":"781498127916367872","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/781162053104840704\/u4wNd-62_normal.jpg","user_id":"21870081","content":"#TeamUSA is lookin' good! 😃 🇺🇸 🏅 https:\/\/t.co\/7h0h4a8CR9","date":"2016-09-29T14:17:27","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TeamUSA\/status\/781498127916367872","id":676188},"url_domain":"twitter.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":false,"updated_date":"2016-09-29T14:29:07.517281","importance":1,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/963400\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"View on twitter.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Rebecca","username":"rebecca.bratek","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Bratek","id":29,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":963400,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/29\/photo-us-olympic-team-visits-white-house-in"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/18\/rio-olympic-ceo-says-his-privately-run-budget","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Rio Olympic CEO says his privately-run budget needs $30 million in public money to meet obligations - AP","whoas":44,"content":"Rio Olympic CEO says his privately-run budget needs $30 million in public money to meet obligations - AP","url":"http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/49645d16c53443ed845275e65d2f93dd","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"<i>Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea<\/i>\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (IBGE, 2008) (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations—Petrobras and Vale—and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of <i>Christ the Redeemer<\/i> atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the <i>Sambódromo<\/i> (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums.<\/p>\n<p>Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracanã Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games.<\/p>","links":"","id":1510,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/rio-de-janeiro-rio-de-janeiro-br\/","latitude":-22.97673,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1510"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:17:44.190137","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"olympics","created_on":"2010-05-28T03:03:15","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J2","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games","name":"Olympics","image_height":292,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2070,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg\/512px-Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The modern <b>Olympic Games<\/b> or <b>Olympics<\/b> (French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Jeux olympiques<\/i><\/span>) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/apne.ws\/2cRaxMm","longitude":null,"slug":"rio-olympic-ceo-says-his-privately-run-budget","url_text":"Read more on bigstory.ap.org","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/bigstory.ap.org\/49645d16c53443ed845275e65d2f93dd","date":"2016-09-18T20:25:57.855418","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D90Y","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 18, 2016, 08:25 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"bigstory.ap.org","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-09-18T20:25:58.419998","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/952716\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on bigstory.ap.org","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Rebecca","username":"rebecca.bratek","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/29\/","full_name":"Rebecca Bratek","email":"Rebecca.Bratek@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Bratek","id":29,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":952716,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/18\/rio-olympic-ceo-says-his-privately-run-budget"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/russian-hackers-release-3rd-batch-of-documents","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"Russian hackers release 3rd batch of documents allegedly stolen from sports doping agency database; athletes from UK, Denmark, Australia, Spain, Germany targeted","whoas":36,"content":"Russian hackers release 3rd batch of documents allegedly stolen from sports doping agency database; athletes from UK, Denmark, Australia, Spain, Germany targeted","url":"","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/2016-olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:07:17.593575","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"2016-olympics","created_on":"2012-10-08T17:33:32","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/nA","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2418","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2016_Summer_Olympics","name":"2016 Olympics","image_height":645,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"off","item_count":1187,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/d\/df\/2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg\/512px-2016_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2418\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>2016 Summer Olympics<\/b> (Portuguese: <span lang=\"pt\" xml:lang=\"pt\"><i>Jogos Olímpicos de Verão de 2016<\/i><\/span>), officially known as the <b>Games of the XXXI Olympiad<\/b> and commonly known as <b>Rio 2016<\/b>, was a major international multi-sport event held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 August to 21 August 2016.<\/p>\n<p>More than 11,000 athletes from 205 National Olympic Committees, including first time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team, took part.

It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.<\/p>\n<p>For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages classifiable into roughly 250 groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the 1850s most of the continent had been explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. By 1942, Australia gained near independence with the passing of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act and achieved full status as an sovereign independent state with the passing of the Australia Act 1986, effectively severing its legal ties with the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories.

It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Major urban areas include Ruhr, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.<\/p>\n<p>Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation.<\/p>\n<p>In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The establishment of the national socialist dictatorship in 1933 led to World War II and a genocide. After a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In 1990, the country was reunified.<\/p>\n<p>In the 21st century, Germany is a great power and has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society. It upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection and a tuition-free university education.<\/p>\n<p>Germany was a founding member of the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.<\/p>","links":"","id":236,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/germany\/","latitude":51.164181,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=236"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/russia\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:38:39.507079","kind":"location","longitude":108.830719,"slug":"russia","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:11:27","geohash":"y6t6hx0r6pe7","trend_rank_last":43,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BZ","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russia","name":"Russia","image_height":341,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":10245,"daily_count":7,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":44,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/f\/f3\/Flag_of_Russia.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/87\/","active":true,"woeid":23424936,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Russia<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/ʌ\/ short 'u' in 'bud'\">ʌ<\/span><span title=\"\/ʃ\/ 'sh' in 'shy'\">ʃ<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Russian: <span lang=\"ru\">Росси́я<\/span>, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossija<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[rɐˈsʲijə]<\/span>; from the Greek: <span lang=\"el\">Ρωσία<\/span> — Rus'), also officially known as the <b>Russian Federation<\/b> (Russian: <span lang=\"ru\">Росси́йская Федера́ция<\/span>, <small>tr.<\/small> <i>Rossijskaja Federacija<\/i>; <small>IPA: <\/small><span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨjə]<\/span>), is a federal state in Eurasia. At 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.<\/p>\n<p>Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally. The country is one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Russia is a great power as well as a regional power and has been characterised as a potential superpower. It is permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the G20, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as being the leading member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and one of the five members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), along with Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.<\/p>","links":"","id":87,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/russia\/","latitude":59.453751,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=87"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/spain\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-29T17:57:37.990733","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spain\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:56:49.656225","kind":"location","longitude":-2.98831,"slug":"spain","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:33:20","geohash":"ezjfgyxuxk6s","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Op","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=909","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spain","name":"Spain","image_height":341,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":1549,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/9\/9a\/Flag_of_Spain.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/909\/","active":true,"woeid":23424950,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Spain<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'s' in 'sigh'\">s<\/span><span title=\"'p' in 'pie'\">p<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Spanish: <span lang=\"es\"><i>España<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[esˈpaɲa]<\/span>), officially the <b>Kingdom of Spain<\/b> (Spanish: <span lang=\"es\"><i>Reino de España<\/i><\/span>), is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla. Along with France and Morocco, it is one of only three countries to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>With an area of 505,990 km<sup>2<\/sup> (195,360 sq mi), Spain is the largest country in Southern Europe, the second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union, and the fourth largest country in the European continent. By population, Spain is the sixth largest in Europe and the fifth in the European Union, after Italy. Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid, other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Bilbao and Málaga.<\/p>\n<p>Modern humans first arrived in the Iberian Peninsula around 35,000 years ago. Iberian cultures along with ancient Phoenician, Greek and Carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named <i>Hispania<\/i>, based on the earlier Phoenician name <i>Span<\/i> or <i>Spania<\/i>. In the Middle Ages, the area was conquered by Germanic tribes and later by the Moors. Spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century, following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of the centuries-long reconquest, or <i>Reconquista<\/i>, of the peninsula from the Moors in 1492. In the early modern period, Spain became one of history's first global colonial empires, leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million Spanish speakers, making Spanish the world's second most spoken first language, after Chinese and before English.<\/p>\n<p>Spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy. It is a middle power and a developed country with the world's fourteenth largest economy by nominal GDP and sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","links":"","id":30,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","latitude":54.314072,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/security\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:01:51.964674","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"security","created_on":"2013-08-28T14:10:18.313463","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":142,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSK","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43410","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Computer_security","name":"cybersecurity","image_height":null,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2153,"daily_count":2,"image_width":null,"trend_rank_current":141,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43410\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Computer security<\/b>, also known as <b>cyber security<\/b> or <b>IT security<\/b>, is the protection of computer systems from the theft or damage to the hardware, software or the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.<\/p>\n<p>It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.<\/p>\n<p>The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems and the Internet in most societies, wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi – and the growth of \"smart\" devices, including smartphones, televisions and tiny devices as part of the Internet of Things.<\/p>","links":"","id":43410,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/security\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43410"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/denmark\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-09T12:51:40.316460","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Denmark\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:14:14.468419","kind":"tag","longitude":9.51695,"slug":"denmark","created_on":"2010-06-14T13:24:09","geohash":"u4nb0sf0112k","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/t7","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2849","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Denmark","name":"Denmark","image_height":387,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":226,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9c\/Flag_of_Denmark.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2849\/","active":true,"woeid":23424796,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Denmark<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ɛ\/ short 'e' in 'bed'\">ɛ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"\/ɑːr\/ 'ar' in 'bard'\">ɑːr<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Danish: <span lang=\"da\"><i>Danmark<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈd̥ænmɑɡ̊]<\/span>) is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The <b>Kingdom of Denmark<\/b> is a sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of 42,924 square kilometres (16,573 sq mi), and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.<\/p>\n<p>The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy.<\/p>\n<p>The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. It establishes a constitutional monarchy organised as a parliamentary democracy. The government and national parliament are seated in Copenhagen, the nation's capital, largest city and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948; in Greenland home rule was established in 1979 and further autonomy in 2009.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"tech","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","name":"tech","image_height":612,"recent_count":2,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13501,"daily_count":3,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":37,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Technology<\/b> (\"science of craft\", from Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">τέχνη<\/span>, <i>techne<\/i>, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">-λογία<\/span>, <i>-logia<\/i>) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D9Zg","longitude":null,"slug":"russian-hackers-release-3rd-batch-of-documents","url_text":"End of alert","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/russian-hackers-release-3rd-batch-of-documents","date":"2016-09-16T15:47:58.248334","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D9Zg","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 16, 2016, 03:47 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-09-16T15:47:59.126886","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/951050\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","username":"tricia.mcdermott","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","full_name":"Tricia McDermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","last_name":"McDermott","id":23,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":951050,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/russian-hackers-release-3rd-batch-of-documents"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/ioc-president-to-ask-russia-for-help-to-stop","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"IOC President to ask Russia for help to stop hackers revealing medical files of Olympic athletes - AP","whoas":29,"content":"IOC President to ask Russia for help to stop hackers revealing medical files of Olympic athletes - AP","url":"","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/world-anti-doping-agency-hacked\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-09-30T15:33:46.813054","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Anti-Doping_Agency\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-13T07:00:40.374599","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"world-anti-doping-agency-hacked","created_on":"2016-09-13T19:56:51.956514","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bexe","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=356716","visible":true,"primary":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Anti-Doping_Agency","name":"World Anti-Doping Agency hacked","image_height":175,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":17,"daily_count":0,"image_width":320,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8f\/WADA_logo.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/356716\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>World Anti-Doping Agency<\/b> (<b>WADA<\/b>) is a foundation initiated by the International Olympic Committee to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports.

At 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.<\/p>\n<p>Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally.

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/thomas-bach\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-11-15T12:53:21.559789","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:05:50.854530","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"thomas-bach","created_on":"2013-06-28T04:25:11.438323","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J7H","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=38261","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thomas_Bach","name":"Thomas Bach","image_height":null,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":44,"daily_count":0,"image_width":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/38261\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Person","description":"<p><b>Thomas Bach<\/b> (born 29 December 1953 in Würzburg, Germany) is a German lawyer and former Olympic fencer.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"tech","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","name":"tech","image_height":612,"recent_count":2,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13501,"daily_count":3,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":37,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Technology<\/b> (\"science of craft\", from Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">τέχνη<\/span>, <i>techne<\/i>, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">-λογία<\/span>, <i>-logia<\/i>) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D9Yk","longitude":null,"slug":"ioc-president-to-ask-russia-for-help-to-stop","url_text":"End of alert","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/ioc-president-to-ask-russia-for-help-to-stop","date":"2016-09-16T14:57:36.316491","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D9Yk","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 16, 2016, 02:57 PM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"breakingnews.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-09-16T14:57:37.420212","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/950992\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"View on breakingnews.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Tricia","username":"tricia.mcdermott","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","full_name":"Tricia McDermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","last_name":"McDermott","id":23,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":950992,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/16\/ioc-president-to-ask-russia-for-help-to-stop"},{"local_url":"\/item\/2016\/09\/15\/more-wada-says-hackers-released-data-of-25","media":null,"status":"published","push_content":"More: WADA says hackers released data of 25 athletes from US, Germany, UK, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Romania, and Russia - AP","whoas":39,"content":"More: WADA says hackers released data of 25 athletes from US, Germany, UK, Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland, Romania, and Russia - AP","url":"http:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/news\/world-anti-doping-agency-says-russian-cyber-espionage-030835372--spt.html","topics":[{"local_url":"\/topic\/world-anti-doping-agency-hacked\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-09-30T15:33:46.813054","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Anti-Doping_Agency\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-13T07:00:40.374599","kind":"arc","longitude":null,"slug":"world-anti-doping-agency-hacked","created_on":"2016-09-13T19:56:51.956514","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bexe","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=356716","visible":true,"primary":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Anti-Doping_Agency","name":"World Anti-Doping Agency hacked","image_height":175,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":17,"daily_count":0,"image_width":320,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8f\/WADA_logo.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/356716\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The <b>World Anti-Doping Agency<\/b> (<b>WADA<\/b>) is a foundation initiated by the International Olympic Committee to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports.

The Czech Republic covers an area of 78,866 square kilometres (30,450 sq mi) with mostly temperate continental climate and oceanic climate. It is a unitary parliamentary republic, has 10.5 million inhabitants and the capital and largest city is Prague, with over 1.2 million residents. The Czech Republic includes its historical territories of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia.<\/p>\n<p>The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the Duchy of Bohemia under the Great Moravian Empire. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the Přemyslid dynasty. In 1004, the duchy was formally recognized as part of the Holy Roman Empire, becoming the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century. Besides Bohemia itself, the king of Bohemia ruled the lands of the Bohemian Crown, he had a vote in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor, and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century. In the Hussite wars of the 15th century driven by the Bohemian Reformation, the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five crusades proclaimed by the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the Habsburg Monarchy alongside the Archduchy of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. The Protestant Bohemian Revolt (1618–20) against the Catholic Habsburgs led to the Thirty Years' War, after which the monarchy consolidated its rule, reimposed Catholicism, and adopted a policy of gradual Germanization. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the Austrian Empire and the Czech language experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread romantic nationalism. In the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I.<\/p>\n<p>The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany in World War II, and was liberated in 1945 by the armies of the Soviet Union and the United States. The Czech country lost the majority of its German-speaking inhabitants after they were expelled following the war. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won the 1946 elections. Following the 1948 coup d'état, Czechoslovakia became a one-party communist state under Soviet influence. In 1968, increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the Prague Spring, which ended in a Soviet-led invasion. Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 Velvet Revolution, when the communist regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.<\/p>\n<p>The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004; it is a member of the United Nations, the OECD, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe. It is a developed country with an advanced, high income economy and high living standards. The UNDP ranks the country 14th in inequality-adjusted human development. The Czech Republic also ranks as the 6th most peaceful country, while achieving strong performance in democratic governance. It has the lowest unemployment rate in the European Union.<\/p>","links":"","id":3894,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/czech-republic\/","latitude":49.803879,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=3894"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/germany\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T23:19:44.146606","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Germany\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T06:12:18.577244","kind":"location","longitude":10.45415,"slug":"germany","created_on":"2011-05-16T22:29:29","geohash":"u1p7jfht0d0t","trend_rank_last":114,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Dy","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=236","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Germany","name":"Germany","image_height":307,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":3302,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":114,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/b\/ba\/Flag_of_Germany.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Germany.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/236\/","active":true,"woeid":23424829,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Germany<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"\/dʒ\/ 'j' in 'jam'\">dʒ<\/span><span title=\"\/ɜːr\/ 'ir' in 'bird'\">ɜːr<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; German: <span lang=\"de\"><i>Deutschland<\/i><\/span>, <small>pronounced<\/small> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈdɔʏtʃlant]<\/span>), officially the <b>Federal Republic of Germany<\/b> (German: <span lang=\"de\"><i>Bundesrepublik Deutschland<\/i><\/span>, <span><span><span> <\/span>listen<\/span> <\/span>), is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of 357,021 square kilometres (137,847 sq mi), and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Major urban areas include Ruhr, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.<\/p>\n<p>Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation.<\/p>\n<p>In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The establishment of the national socialist dictatorship in 1933 led to World War II and a genocide. After a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. In 1990, the country was reunified.<\/p>\n<p>In the 21st century, Germany is a great power and has the world's fourth-largest economy by nominal GDP, as well as the fifth-largest by PPP. As a global leader in several industrial and technological sectors, it is both the world's third-largest exporter and importer of goods. Germany is a developed country with a very high standard of living sustained by a skilled and productive society. It upholds a social security and universal health care system, environmental protection and a tuition-free university education.<\/p>\n<p>Germany was a founding member of the European Union in 1993. It is part of the Schengen Area, and became a co-founder of the Eurozone in 1999. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the G8, the G20, and the OECD. The national military expenditure is the 9th highest in the world. Known for its rich cultural history, Germany has been continuously the home of influential artists, philosophers, musicians, sportspeople, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers, and inventors.<\/p>","links":"","id":236,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/germany\/","latitude":51.164181,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=236"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/poland\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T14:51:08.650241","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poland\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:55:35.333637","kind":"location","longitude":19.1343,"slug":"poland","created_on":"2011-04-22T17:17:31","geohash":"u3jx77t1t82n","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/48","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=3532","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poland","name":"Poland","image_height":320,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":535,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/1\/12\/Flag_of_Poland.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Poland.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/3532\/","active":true,"woeid":23424923,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Poland<\/b> (Polish: <span lang=\"pl\"><i>Polska<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈpɔlska]<\/span>), officially the <b>Republic of Poland<\/b> (Polish: <span lang=\"pl\"><i>Rzeczpospolita Polska<\/i><\/span>, <span><span><span> <\/span>listen<\/span> <\/span>), is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is 312,679 square kilometres (120,726 sq mi), making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union, as well as the most populous post-communist member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk and Szczecin—the country's largest urban agglomeration is the Silesian Metropolis.<\/p>\n<p>The establishment of a Polish state can be traced back to 966, when Mieszko I, ruler of a territory roughly coextensive with that of present-day Poland, converted to Christianity. The Kingdom of Poland was founded in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented a longstanding political association with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by signing the Union of Lublin. This union formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th and 17th century Europe. The Commonwealth ceased to exist in the years 1772–95, when its territory was partitioned among Prussia, the Russian Empire, and Austria. Poland regained its independence (as the Second Polish Republic) at the end of World War I, in 1918.<\/p>\n<p>In September 1939, World War II started with the invasions of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (as part of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact). More than six million Polish citizens died in the war. The borders of Poland were shifted westwards according to the Potsdam Conference in the aftermath of World War II. After the war, with the backing of the Soviet Union, a communist puppet government was formed, and after a falsified referendum in 1946, it took control of the country—turning Poland into a satellite state of the Soviet Union (as the People's Republic of Poland). During the Revolutions of 1989 Poland's Communist government was overthrown and Poland adopted a new constitution establishing itself as a democracy. Despite the large number of casualties and destruction the country experienced during World War II, the country managed to preserve much of its cultural wealth. There are 14 heritage sites inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage and 54 Historical Monuments and many objects of cultural heritage in Poland.<\/p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the transition to a primarily market-based economy that took place in the early 1990s, Poland has achieved a \"very high\" ranking on the Human Development Index, as well as gradually improving economic freedom. Poland is a democratic country with an advanced high-income economy, a high quality of life and a very high standard of living. Moreover, the country is visited by nearly 16 million tourists every year (2013), which makes it one of the most visited countries in the world. Poland is the eighth largest economy in the European Union and among the fastest growing European economies. Furthermore, according to the Global Peace Index for 2014, Poland is one of the safest countries in the world to live in.<\/p>","links":"","id":3532,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/poland\/","latitude":51.918919,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=3532"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/romania\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-31T12:15:50.657762","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Romania\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T01:42:55.691423","kind":"location","longitude":24.9804,"slug":"romania","created_on":"2011-04-25T16:56:37","geohash":"u81v2kqhjdbq","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ng","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=838","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Romania","name":"Romania","image_height":341,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":216,"daily_count":1,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/73\/Flag_of_Romania.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/838\/","active":true,"woeid":23424933,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Romania<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"'r' in 'rye'\">r<\/span><span title=\"\/oʊ\/ long 'o' in 'code'\">oʊ<\/span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"\/eɪ\/ long 'a' in 'base'\">eɪ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"\/i\/ 'y' in 'happy'\">i<\/span><span title=\"\/ə\/ 'a' in 'about'\">ə<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span> <span title=\"English pronunciation respelling\"><i>roh-<b><span><span>MAY<\/span><\/span><\/b>-nee-ə<\/i><\/span>; Romanian: <span lang=\"ro\"><i>România<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[romɨˈni.a]<\/span>) is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe.

The Carpathian Mountains, with their tallest peak Moldoveanu at 2,544 m (8,346 ft), cross Romania from the north to the southwest.<\/p>\n<p>Modern Romania emerged within the territories of the ancient Roman province of Dacia, and was formed in 1859 through a personal union of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of Romania. During World War II, Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, fighting side by side with the Wehrmacht until 1944, when it then joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the Red Army forces. Romania lost several territories, of which Northern Transylvania was regained after the war. Following the war, Romania became a socialist republic and member of the Warsaw Pact.

At 17,075,200 square kilometres (6,592,800 sq mi), Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one eighth of Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 146.6 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the East, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara.<\/p>\n<p>Extending across the entirety of Northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.<\/p>\n<p>The nation's history began with that of the East Slavs, who emerged as a recognizable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Founded and ruled by a Varangian warrior elite and their descendants, the medieval state of Rus arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted Orthodox Christianity from the Byzantine Empire, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Russian culture for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states; most of the Rus' lands were overrun by the Mongol invasion and became tributaries of the nomadic Golden Horde in the 13th century. The Grand Duchy of Moscow gradually reunified the surrounding Russian principalities, achieved independence from the Golden Horde, and came to dominate the cultural and political legacy of Kievan Rus'. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and exploration to become the Russian Empire, which was the third largest empire in history, stretching from Poland on the west to Alaska on the east.<\/p>\n<p>Following the Russian Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became the largest and leading constituent of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the world's first constitutionally socialist state. The Soviet Union played a decisive role in the Allied victory in World War II, and emerged as a recognized superpower and rival to the United States during the Cold War. The Soviet era saw some of the most significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including the world's first human-made satellite and the launching of the first humans in space. By the end of 1990, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest economy, largest standing military in the world and the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. Following the partition of the Soviet Union in 1991, fourteen independent republics emerged from the USSR; as the largest, most populous, and most economically developed republic, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognized as the continuing legal personality and sole successor state of the Soviet Union. It is governed as a federal semi-presidential republic.<\/p>\n<p>The Russian economy ranks as the twelfth largest by nominal GDP and sixth largest by purchasing power parity in 2015. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading producers of oil and natural gas globally.

Lying off the northwestern coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the northeastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign state, the Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-southwest, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of 242,500 square kilometres (93,600 sq mi), the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of governance. The monarch—since 6 February 1952—is Queen Elizabeth II. The capital of the UK and its largest city is London, a global city and financial centre with an urban area population of 10.3 million, the fourth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union. Other major urban areas in the UK include the regions of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow and Liverpool.<\/p>\n<p>The UK consists of four countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The last three have devolved administrations, each with varying powers, based in their capitals, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, respectively. The nearby Isle of Man, Bailiwick of Guernsey and Bailiwick of Jersey are not part of the United Kingdom, being Crown dependencies with the British Government responsible for defence and international representation.<\/p>\n<p>The relationships among the countries of the United Kingdom have changed over time. Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542. A treaty between England and Scotland resulted in 1707 in a unified Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged in 1801 with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, five-sixths of Ireland seceded from the UK, leaving the present formulation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are fourteen British Overseas Territories. These are the remnants of the British Empire which, at its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world's land mass and was the largest empire in history. British influence can be observed in the language, culture, and legal systems of many of its former colonies.<\/p>\n<p>The United Kingdom is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 14th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised nuclear weapons state and its military expenditure ranks fourth or fifth in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a 51.9% vote to exit. The UK is also a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).<\/p>","links":"","id":30,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-kingdom\/","latitude":54.314072,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=30"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T04:30:38.828232","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:12:00.117419","kind":"location","longitude":-95.845016,"slug":"united-states","created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","trend_rank_last":8,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","name":"United States","image_height":269,"recent_count":3,"facebookchat":"","item_count":28200,"daily_count":14,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":8,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/thumb\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg\/512px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","active":true,"woeid":23424977,"category":"Country","description":"<p>The <b>United States of America<\/b> (<b>USA<\/b>), commonly referred to as the <b>United States<\/b> (<b>U.S.<\/b>) or <b>America<\/b>, is a federal republic composed of <span>‹See TfD›<\/span>50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. Forty-eight of the fifty states and the federal district are contiguous and located in North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the far northwestern corner of North America, with a land border to the east with Canada and separated by the Bering Strait from Russia. The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geography, climate and wildlife of the country are extremely diverse.<\/p>\n<p>At 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with over 324 million people, the United States is the world's fourth-largest country by total area (and fourth-largest by land area) and the third-most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, and is home to the world's largest immigrant population. Urbanization climbed to over 80% in 2010 and leads to growing megaregions. The country's capital is Washington, D.C. and its largest city is New York City; the other major metropolitan areas, all with around five million or more inhabitants, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, and Atlanta.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Asia to the North American mainland at least 15,000 years ago. European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies in the aftermath of the Seven Years' War led to the American Revolution, which began in 1775. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current constitution was adopted in 1788, after the Articles of Confederation, adopted in 1781, were felt to have provided inadequate federal powers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties.<\/p>\n<p>The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War led to the end of legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and <span>World War I<\/span> confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from <span>World War II<\/span> as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a founding member of the Organization of American States (UAS) and various other Pan-American and international organisations. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP. It ranks highly in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge economy, the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.4% of the world total, the United States accounts for nearly a quarter of world GDP and almost a third of global military spending, making it the world's foremost military and economic power. The United States is a prominent political and cultural force internationally, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.<\/p>","links":"","id":10,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","latitude":37.167931,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/security\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:43:24.889470","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T03:01:51.964674","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"security","created_on":"2013-08-28T14:10:18.313463","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":142,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LSK","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43410","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Computer_security","name":"cybersecurity","image_height":null,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2153,"daily_count":2,"image_width":null,"trend_rank_current":141,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43410\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Subvertical","description":"<p><b>Computer security<\/b>, also known as <b>cyber security<\/b> or <b>IT security<\/b>, is the protection of computer systems from the theft or damage to the hardware, software or the information on them, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.<\/p>\n<p>It includes controlling physical access to the hardware, as well as protecting against harm that may come via network access, data and code injection, and due to malpractice by operators, whether intentional, accidental, or due to them being tricked into deviating from secure procedures.<\/p>\n<p>The field is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance on computer systems and the Internet in most societies, wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi – and the growth of \"smart\" devices, including smartphones, televisions and tiny devices as part of the Internet of Things.<\/p>","links":"","id":43410,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/security\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43410"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/denmark\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-09T12:51:40.316460","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Denmark\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"Country","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-19T22:14:14.468419","kind":"tag","longitude":9.51695,"slug":"denmark","created_on":"2010-06-14T13:24:09","geohash":"u4nb0sf0112k","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/t7","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2849","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Denmark","name":"Denmark","image_height":387,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":226,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/9c\/Flag_of_Denmark.svg\/512px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2849\/","active":true,"woeid":23424796,"category":"Country","description":"<p><b>Denmark<\/b> (<span><span>\/<span><span title=\"\/ˈ\/ primary stress follows\">ˈ<\/span><span title=\"'d' in 'dye'\">d<\/span><span title=\"\/ɛ\/ short 'e' in 'bed'\">ɛ<\/span><span title=\"'n' in 'no'\">n<\/span><span title=\"'m' in 'my'\">m<\/span><span title=\"\/ɑːr\/ 'ar' in 'bard'\">ɑːr<\/span><span title=\"'k' in 'kind'\">k<\/span><\/span>\/<\/span><\/span>; Danish: <span lang=\"da\"><i>Danmark<\/i><\/span> <span title=\"Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)\">[ˈd̥ænmɑɡ̊]<\/span>) is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The <b>Kingdom of Denmark<\/b> is a sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of 42,924 square kilometres (16,573 sq mi), and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.<\/p>\n<p>The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and Greenland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed mixed economy.<\/p>\n<p>The Constitution of Denmark was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy which had begun in 1660. It establishes a constitutional monarchy organised as a parliamentary democracy. The government and national parliament are seated in Copenhagen, the nation's capital, largest city and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948; in Greenland home rule was established in 1979 and further autonomy in 2009. Denmark became a member of the European Economic Community (now the EU) in 1973, maintaining certain opt-outs; it retains its own currency, the krone. It is among the founding members of NATO, the Nordic Council, the OECD, OSCE, and the United Nations; it is also part of the Schengen Area.<\/p>\n<p>Danes enjoy a high standard of living and the country ranks highly in some metrics of national performance, including education, health care, protection of civil liberties, democratic governance, prosperity and human development. The country ranks as having the world's highest social mobility, a high level of income equality, is the country with the lowest perceived level of corruption in the world, has one of the world's highest per capita incomes, and one of the world's highest personal income tax rates.<\/p>","links":"","id":2849,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/denmark\/","latitude":56.276089,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2849"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/olympics\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-30T22:42:47.229184","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T19:17:44.190137","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"olympics","created_on":"2010-05-28T03:03:15","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/J2","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=612","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Olympic_Games","name":"Olympics","image_height":292,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":2070,"daily_count":0,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/0\/02\/Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg\/512px-Olympic_medals_2000_-_2016.svg.png","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/612\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"SportsEvent","description":"<p>The modern <b>Olympic Games<\/b> or <b>Olympics<\/b> (French: <span lang=\"fr\" xml:lang=\"fr\"><i>Jeux olympiques<\/i><\/span>) are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.<\/p>\n<p>Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics has shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympic Movement consists of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in each event receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Games have grown so much that nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created numerous challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, bribery, and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute an opportunity for the host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.<\/p>","links":"","id":612,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/olympics\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=612"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/world-anti-doping-agency\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2016-12-09T12:29:29.858347","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Anti-Doping_Agency\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:33.273946","kind":"tag","longitude":null,"slug":"world-anti-doping-agency","created_on":"2012-12-19T00:44:11","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Bef","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5735","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_Anti-Doping_Agency","name":"World Anti-Doping Agency","image_height":175,"recent_count":0,"facebookchat":"","item_count":173,"daily_count":0,"image_width":320,"trend_rank_current":0,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/8\/8f\/WADA_logo.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5735\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Organization","description":"<p>The <b>World Anti-Doping Agency<\/b> (<b>WADA<\/b>) is a foundation initiated by the International Olympic Committee to promote, coordinate and monitor the fight against drugs in sports.

The term \"crime\" does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. One proposed definition is that a crime or <b>offence<\/b> (or <b>criminal offence<\/b>) is an act harmful not only to some individual or individuals but also to a community, society or the state (\"a public wrong\"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The notion that acts such as murder, rape and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. In modern societies, there are procedures to which investigations and trials must adhere. If found guilty, an offender may be sentenced to a form of reparation such as a community sentence, or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, execution.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (<i>actus reus<\/i>) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (<i>mens rea<\/i>).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","links":"","id":1,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T03:34:25.334497","twitter_username":null,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:25.888651","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"sports","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":62,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","name":"sports","image_height":291,"recent_count":1,"facebookchat":"","item_count":27471,"daily_count":13,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":61,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg\/512px-Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (UK) or <b>sports<\/b> (US) are all usually forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators. Usually the contest or game is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a tie game; others provide tie-breaking methods, to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of such two-sided contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, each against each other, with one winner.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as system of activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess Pictures of Chess, draughts (checkers), Go, and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sports betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is its most popular spectator sport.<\/p>","links":"","id":55,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55"},{"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","muted_by_default":false,"latest_item_date":"2017-01-01T05:14:19.921351","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","placetype":"","livevideo":"","wikipedia_content_date":"2016-12-20T05:53:07.588669","kind":"vertical","longitude":null,"slug":"tech","created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","visible":true,"wikipedia_url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","name":"tech","image_height":612,"recent_count":2,"facebookchat":"","item_count":13501,"daily_count":3,"image_width":512,"trend_rank_current":37,"ping_category":[],"image_url":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/79\/Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg\/512px-Dampfturbine_Montage01.jpg","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","active":true,"woeid":null,"category":"Topic","description":"<p><b>Technology<\/b> (\"science of craft\", from Greek <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">τέχνη<\/span>, <i>techne<\/i>, \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and <span lang=\"grc\" xml:lang=\"grc\">-λογία<\/span>, <i>-logia<\/i>) is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but 21st century scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and passed their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","links":"","id":25,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/tech\/","latitude":null,"related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25"}],"shortened_url":"http:\/\/yhoo.it\/2csK1b1","longitude":null,"slug":"more-wada-says-hackers-released-data-of-25","url_text":"Read more on yahoo.com","note":null,"url_external_link":"http:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/news\/world-anti-doping-agency-says-russian-cyber-espionage-030835372--spt.html","date":"2016-09-15T03:31:01.049302","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/D9FM","type":"text","sponsor":null,"date_ap":"Sep 15, 2016, 03:31 AM GMT","tweet":null,"url_domain":"yahoo.com","submitter":"editor","data_type":null,"pushed":true,"updated_date":"2016-09-15T03:31:02.350287","importance":3,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/949790\/","latitude":null,"url_external_text":"Read more on yahoo.com","source":null,"author":{"first_name":"Jimmy","username":"jimmy.lovaas","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/22\/","full_name":"Jimmy Lovaas","email":"jimmy.lovaas@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Lovaas","id":22,"is_staff":false},"ping":null,"id":949790,"data":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2016\/09\/15\/more-wada-says-hackers-released-data-of-25"}]}
